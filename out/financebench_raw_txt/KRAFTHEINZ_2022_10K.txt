profitable categories; product recalls or other product liability claims; climate change and legal or regulatory responses; our ability to identify, complete, or
realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures, or investments; our ability to successfully execute our strategic
initiatives; the impacts of our international operations; our ability to protect intellectual property rights; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from
prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness; the influence of our largest
stockholder; our level of indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments; additional impairments of the carrying
amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; volatility in commodity, energy, and other input costs;

and various other nations where we do business (including inflationary pressures, general economic slowdown, or recession); changes in our management
team or other key personnel and our ability to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce; our dependence on information
technology and systems, including service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security; increased pension, labor, and people-related
expenses; changes in tax laws and interpretations; volatility of capital markets and other macroeconomic factors; and other factors. For additional
information on these and other factors that could affect our forward-looking statements, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. We disclaim and do not undertake any
obligation to update, revise, or withdraw any forward-looking statement in this report, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
PART I
Item 1. Business.
General
We are driving transformation at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC), inspired by our Purpose, Let’s Make Life Delicious. Consumers are at the
center of everything we do. With 2022 net sales of approximately $26 billion, we are committed to growing our iconic and emerging food and beverage
brands on a global scale. We leverage our scale and agility to unleash the full power of Kraft Heinz across a portfolio of six consumer-driven product
platforms. As global citizens, we’re dedicated to making a sustainable, ethical impact while helping to feed the world in healthy, responsible ways.
On July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz
Company, and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company.
Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire Hathaway”) and 3G Global Food Holdings,
LP (“3G Global Food Holdings” and, together with its affiliates, “3G Capital”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the
“2013 Heinz Acquisition”).
We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on
December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that
ended on December 26, 2020.
Reportable Segments:
In the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North
America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by
streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable
segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
See Note 20, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our geographic financial information by segment.
Resources
Trademarks and Intellectual Property:
Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as
long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by
segment based on net sales in 2022 were:
Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks
North America Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Capri Sun*, Maxwell House, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O
International Heinz, ABC, Master, Kraft, Quero, Golden Circle, Wattie’s, Plasmon, Pudliszki
    *Used under license.
We sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2022, brands used under licenses from third parties included Capri Sun packaged
drink pouches for sale in the United States. We also grant certain licenses to third parties to use our intellectual property rights in select jurisdictions. In
2021, in our agreements with an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (“Lactalis”), related to the sale of certain assets in our global cheese business, we each granted
the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in perpetuity, including perpetual licenses for the Kraft
and Velveeta brands for certain cheese products.
We also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties,
proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or
applied for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent
portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
1
Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
Raw Materials and Packaging:
We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of
commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and
vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins,
fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our
products. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements
and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their
operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers and smaller, local, independent sellers.
Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective
of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by
external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts,
consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, and agricultural programs. In
2022, we continued to experience higher commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to
inflationary pressures. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023.
Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices.
Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and
that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many
of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and
other operational measures.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives:
•product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs, support our environmental and sustainability goals, and
drive growth;
•world-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;
•superior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and
•continuous process, product, and supply chain optimization.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce
retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local
and regional companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the
basis of product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing
and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing
new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.
Sales
Sales and Customers:
Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative, and
independent grocery accounts; convenience, value, and club stores; pharmacies and drug stores; mass merchants; foodservice distributors; and institutions,
including hotels, restaurants, bakeries, hospitals, health care facilities, and government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-
commerce platforms and retailers.
2
We have key customers in different regions around the world. In 2022, the five largest customers in our North America segment accounted for
approximately 46% of North America segment net sales and the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for approximately 14% of
International segment net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2022 and approximately 22% of our
net sales in each of 2021 and 2020. Both of our segments have sales to Walmart Inc.
We manage our sales portfolio through six consumer-driven product platforms. A platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of real
consumer needs and includes the following for Kraft Heinz: Taste Elevation, Fast Fresh Meals, Easy Meals Made Better, Real Food Snacking, Flavorful
Hydration, and Easy Indulgent Desserts. The platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market. Further, each platform is assigned
a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions, which are made at the reportable segment level. These roles
include: Grow, Energize, and Stabilize. The role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market. The platform approach helps us to manage
our business efficiently, including the oversight of our various product categories and brands, and transforms the way we plan for our growth.
Net Sales by Platform:
Net sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
Taste Elevation 31 % 28 % 26 %
Fast Fresh Meals 23 % 25 % 26 %
Easy Meals Made Better 20 % 19 % 19 %
Real Food Snacking 5 % 7 % 9 %
Flavorful Hydration 8 % 7 % 6 %
Easy Indulgent Desserts 4 % 4 % 4 %
Other 9 % 10 % 10 %
Net Sales by Product Category:
The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
Condiments and sauces 31 % 28 % 26 %
Cheese and dairy 15 % 19 % 20 %
Ambient foods 12 % 11 % 11 %
Frozen and chilled foods 11 % 10 % 10 %
Meats and seafood 10 % 10 % 10 %
Seasonality
Although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the
year.
Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these
factors influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-
period (e.g., a shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment
results.
3
Government Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation,
storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality, and safety of our products and their ingredients, and our occupational safety,
health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal
government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor,
Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous laws and
regulations outside of the United States in markets where our products are manufactured, distributed, or sold, including laws and regulations governing
food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption
regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our
businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance
efforts.
Environmental Regulation:
Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the
handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our
operations.
In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA
imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under
CERCLA (and other state actions under similar legislation) related to certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability.
As of December 31, 2022, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we
believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our general compliance with environmental laws and regulations will
not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance
efforts and environmental remedial actions and, thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.
Human Capital Management
We are driven by our Purpose, our Vision—To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally, and our Values—We are consumer obsessed, We
dare to do better every day, We champion great people, We demand diversity, We do the right thing, and We own it. We recognize that a strong company
culture is vital to our overall success. Our Purpose, Vision, and Values are the foundation upon which our culture is built. They represent the expectations
we have for ourselves and the environment we aspire to create for our Company.
Our people are at the heart of who we are at Kraft Heinz. We drive growth through development opportunities, career ownership, and autonomy and
recognize and reward outstanding performance at every level, creating a true spirit of meritocracy. We strive to channel our employees’ passion, curiosity,
and attitude to make an impact on our future and our legacy by leading as learners, acting as owners, and being change agents. Our Board of Directors
(“Board”), through the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, oversees our human resources strategy, key policies, and our 2025 diversity,
inclusion, and belonging aspirations.
Engagement and Retention:
We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining diverse, world-class talent and creating an engaging and inclusive culture that embodies our
Purpose, Vision, and Values. As of December 31, 2022, Kraft Heinz had approximately 37,000 employees globally. Driven by our Value We champion
great people, we support our employees’ health, safety, and professional development and reward outstanding performance at every level. Our
compensation, benefits, recognition, and LiveWell programs are designed to attract and engage highly skilled talent, meet individual and family needs, and
inspire, celebrate, and engage our people and teams through active listening channels.
Guided by our Values, we conduct a global engagement survey annually to provide employees with an opportunity to share anonymous feedback with
management across a variety of topic areas. The results, and comments are reviewed by the Board, senior leadership, managers, and human resources to
help determine where changes are needed to support our people and teams.
4
Wellbeing and Safety:
Our employees’ health, safety, and wellbeing are a top priority. We establish and administer company-wide policies and processes to protect the health,
safety, and security of our employees, subcontractors, and all those who visit our facilities, and to comply with applicable regulations. We review and
monitor our performance closely to drive continuous improvement. To help us evaluate how effective our safety efforts are in lowering incidents rates, we
use a Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”). TRIR is a medical incident rate based on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 hours). Our TRIR globally was 0.53 in 2022 and 0.62 in 2021.
Our global LiveWell program addresses physical, emotional, financial, and social health and wellbeing. We champion the LiveWell program’s holistic
approach to wellbeing with enhanced programs, including healthcare benefits, disability, and employee assistance initiatives.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging:
We live our Value of We demand diversity by focusing on three strategic areas: hiring and growing talent from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,
developing inclusive leaders, and tracking and reporting our progress. Our Global Inclusion Council has been established to create strategic accountability
for results. It also provides governance and oversight of reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is comprised of executive leaders and
members of the Board. In 2021, we shared our 2025 diversity, inclusion, and belonging aspirations, which include that 50% of our global management
positions be filled by women and 30% of our salaried U.S. employee population identify as people of color. As of December 31, 2022:
•41% of employees in management positions globally identified as women;
•28% of salaried employees in the U.S. identified as people of color;
•40% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as women; and
•80% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as people of color.
As we work to meet our 2025 aspirations, we are focused on:
•Hiring and Growing Talent from Diverse Backgrounds and Perspectives through expanded recruiting partnerships with Historically Black
Colleges and Universities and training and leveraging artificial intelligence in our hiring process to reduce bias. In addition, our Business Resource
Groups (BRGs) offer learning and development opportunities and create a network of support for employees.
•Developing Inclusive Leaders through an interactive learning experience for managers on interrupting bias in our Organizational People Review
process and their role in creating an inclusive environment.
•Tracking and Reporting Our Progress year over year through oversight by the Kraft Heinz Global Inclusion Council.
Learning and Development:
Through Kraft Heinz Ownerversity, we provide learning and development offerings to employees via live and virtual learning experiences. These offerings
enable employees to execute with excellence in their roles, accelerate their learning curves, and grow great careers through continuous learning. With
Ownerversity’s targeted platforms, employees can focus on timely and topical development areas including leadership, management excellence, functional
capabilities, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. In 2022, our global women’s accelerator program, The WE Network, won a Brandon Hall Gold
Award for Best Advance in Leadership Development for Women.
Rewards and Compensation:
Our Total Rewards strategy is designed to provide an array of meaningful and flexible programs for our diverse workforce. Total Rewards includes
compensation elements of salary and wages and incentives, healthcare, savings and insurance plans, wellbeing plans, employee recognition programs, and
other voluntary elected benefits. We aim for global consistency while respecting local market practices. The plans are designed to be market competitive
and data-driven to promote our high-performance and results-oriented culture and realize our Purpose to Make Life Delicious for employees and their
families.
Ethics and Transparency:
The Kraft Heinz Ethics Helpline is available to our partners, suppliers, customers, and consumers to ask questions or report potential violations of various
policies and ethical guidelines, including our Code of Conduct, Supplier Guiding Principles, and Global Human Rights Policy.
We report more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives related to our people and human capital management in our Environmental
Social Governance Report (“ESG Report”). Our 2022 ESG Report, which provides our progress through 2021, is available on our website at
www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg. The information on our website, including our ESG Report, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the risks
and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered
when evaluating Kraft Heinz. Although the risks are organized and described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have
identified and discussed the material risks affecting our business below, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that
are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.
Industry Risks
We operate in a highly competitive industry.
The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers
and retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service,
taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy
changing consumer preferences.
We may need to reduce our prices, or be restricted or delayed in our ability to increase prices, in response to competitive, customer, consumer, regulatory,
or macroeconomic pressures, including pressures related to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted,
and may in the future continue to restrict, our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases, including those related to
inflationary pressures. Additionally, we expect that there could be a difference between the timing of when we take pricing actions and the impact of those
beneficial actions on our results of operations. Failure to effectively assess, timely change, and properly set pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may
negatively impact our ability to achieve our objectives.
The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer
relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases, including those related to
inflationary pressures. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product,
platform, or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and
consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.
Our success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to
meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.
Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret
the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do
not offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales,
financial condition, and operating results.
Moreover, weak economic conditions, recessions, inflation, severe or unusual weather events, global or local pandemics, including COVID-19, as well as
other factors, could affect consumer preferences and demand, at times, causing a strain on our supply chain due, in part, to retailers, distributors, or carriers
modifying their restocking, fulfillment, or shipping practices. Failure to adequately respond to these changes could adversely affect our product sales,
financial condition, and operating results.
We must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer
preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition,
because of our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfies a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our
product offerings successfully across product categories or platforms, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable
categories, demand for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.
Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health, environmental, or social implications of certain food and beverage products, ingredients, or
packaging materials could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of our products and marketing programs. Our ability to refine the ingredient and
nutrition profiles of and packaging for our products as well as to maintain focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management opportunities to address
evolving consumer preferences are important to our growth. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be
successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition, and operating results.
7
In addition, our growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are
inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on
our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to
correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon
the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our
competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance.
Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors in our major markets, may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but
larger customers for our business across various channels. These larger customers may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by
demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically tailored product offerings. In
addition, larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own
private label products. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and
operating results.
Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding
adverse effect on us, which could be material. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or
cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
In addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also
significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes, we may be
disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and
operating results.
Changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers, or in other business relationships, could adversely impact us.
We derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business). Some or all of our
significant customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as
increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a material
reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our
customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, terminations of relationships
with other significant contractual counterparties, including licensors, could adversely affect our portfolio, product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.
In addition, the financial condition of such customers, suppliers, and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and
events that are beyond our control. Significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers or suppliers, or in other business
relationships, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Maintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success.
We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our
existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.
We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product
innovation. Negative perceptions of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of our
marketing practices. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social impacts,
our other environmental, social, human capital, or governance practices, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, or our suppliers and, in some
cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers’ or consumers’ confidence, and reduce demand for our
products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Furthermore,
8
existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could
limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands.
In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media
environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media
increases the speed and extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or
our products, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and
reputation. In addition, we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining,
extending, and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
We must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products.
In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our
products must provide higher value or quality to consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness or inflation.
Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of
competitors’ products or if consumers perceive such a change. If consumers prefer private label products, then we could lose market share or sales volume,
or our product mix could shift to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other
expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster-
growing and more profitable categories.
Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms as well as growth in the food and beverage
industry in the geographies in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new
products in faster-growing and more profitable categories or platforms and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories or
platforms. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market share decreases in our key product categories or platforms, or develop innovative products for
new and existing categories or platforms could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.
Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens,
or other adulteration. We have decided and could in the future decide to, and have been or could in the future be required to, recall products due to
suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, undeclared allergens, or other deficiencies.
Product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the
unavailability of the product for a period of time.
We could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products or ingredients, or the food safety system
generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our
products, or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition.
We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition,
our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related
regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover,
even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued to conclusion, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against
our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Climate change and legal or regulatory responses may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
which is projected to contribute to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters,
and changes in agricultural productivity. Increasing concern over climate change may adversely impact demand for our products, or increase our operating
costs, due to changes in consumer preferences that cause consumers to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have a high climate change
impact.
9
Increased natural disasters and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the
availability or increase the cost of natural resources and commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes,
coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products, and could
further decrease food security for communities around the world. Climate change, and its environmental impacts, could also affect our ability, and our
suppliers’ ability, to procure necessary commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to increase costs or make
additional unplanned capital expenditures. Further, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters could result in disruptions for us, our
customers, suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, and distributors and impact our employees’ abilities to commute or work from home effectively. These
disruptions could make it more difficult and costly for us to deliver our products, obtain raw materials or other supplies through our supply chain, maintain
or resume operations, or perform other critical corporate functions, could reduce customer demand for our products, and could increase the cost of
insurance.
Additionally, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to
climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations, and sustainability.
Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change, as well as additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding
climate change designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and
may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our manufacturing and processing facilities and our business, as well as
increase distribution and supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant
changes to our business operations and long-term operating plans, which will likely incur substantial time, attention, and costs. Even if we make changes to
align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and
applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a
long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Finally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, stockholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change and
related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to
effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and
negatively affect our business and reputation. Additionally, from time to time we establish and publicly announce environmental, social, and governance
goals, commitments, and aspirations, including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is
subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements
affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, the pace of changes in technology, the availability of requisite
financing, and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. Furthermore, standards for tracking and reporting such
matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and
standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting this data may be updated and previously reported data
may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our
operations, and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability and other matters across our operations and supply
chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting sustainability metrics, including sustainability-related
disclosures that may be required by the SEC and European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant
revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If we fail to achieve, or are perceived
to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report on our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect
consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.

Business Risks
We may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures, or investments.
From time to time, we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances, joint ventures, or investments that may strategically
fit our business objectives, and, as a result of some of these evaluations, we have acquired businesses or assets that we deem to be a strategic fit. We have
also divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. These activities may present
financial, managerial, and operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties in
integrating, or inability to successfully integrate, acquired businesses, including integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems;
inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population; adverse effects on existing or
acquired customer and supplier business relationships; and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by
numerous antitrust and competition laws in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. We have in the past and
may in the future be required to obtain approval of these transactions by competition authorities or to satisfy other legal requirements, and we may be
unable to obtain such approvals or satisfy such requirements, each of which may result in additional costs, time delays, or our inability to complete such
transactions, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
To the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, or other developments in new geographies or categories, we may face
additional risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations are discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our
international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.”
To the extent we undertake divestitures, we may face additional risks related to such activities. For example, risks related to our ability to find appropriate
buyers, execute transactions on favorable terms, separate divested business operations with minimal impact to our remaining operations, and effectively
manage any transitional service arrangements. Further, our divestiture activities have in the past required, and may in the future require, us to recognize
impairment charges. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives.
We plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes, and purchasing trends may differ in these
markets and, as a result, our sales strategies may not be successful and our product sales may not meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be
less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information
technology systems, and other operations. Additionally, we may not successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives, including achieving any
previously announced productivity efficiencies and financial targets, any new business may not be profitable or meet our expectations, or any divestiture
may not be completed without disruption. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels, which could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.
We are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 30% of our 2022 net
sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially
by market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section, and also include:
•compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery and corruption laws such as the FCPA;
•changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax laws or their
interpretations, or tax audit implications;
•the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, or similar restrictions on our sales or imports, trade agreements, regulations,
taxes, or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs;
•foreign currency devaluations or fluctuations in foreign currency values, including risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange markets and the decisions made and positions taken to hedge such volatility;
•compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, human rights laws, and a variety of other local, national, and multi-national
regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions;
•discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions;
11
•changes in capital controls, including foreign currency exchange controls, governmental foreign currency policies, or other limits on our ability to
import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;
•challenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including economic sanctions, export controls, and labor restrictions;
•changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and
the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;
•risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, military conflict, corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic
unrest in the countries in which we operate;
•the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application, and
enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;
•changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;
•greater risk of uncollectible accounts or trade receivables and longer collection cycles; and
•design, implementation, and use of effective control environment processes across our various operations and employee base.
Slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing
power could adversely impact our profitability. Any of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely
affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyrights, and
licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of
patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and trade dress laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements,
policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property, and securing our information technology systems. Our failure to develop or adequately protect
our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current
legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business, and
financial condition. We also license certain intellectual property, most notably trademarks, from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract
with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties, our rights to use certain intellectual property could be
impacted, which may adversely impact our results from operations.
We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or
other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business
operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to
significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, or
improve our competitiveness.
We have implemented a number of initiatives, including development of an operations center and strategic long-term collaboration with suppliers, that we
believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational
structure and operations to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend
upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost-saving initiatives. In addition, certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other
aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any
plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an environment of increased
competition. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute in those areas with the most potential return
on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts, we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our
competitiveness, production, profitability, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.
Berkshire Hathaway has the ability to exert influence over us and significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.
12
As of December 31, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 26.6% of our common stock. Three members of our Board are officers and/or directors
of Berkshire Hathaway or its affiliates. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway has the potential to exercise influence over management and Board decisions,
including those affecting our capital structure, such as the issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the declaration and amount of dividends. Berkshire Hathaway also has influence over any action
requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting any amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or
sales of substantially all of our capital stock or assets. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway is in the business of making investments in companies and may
from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Berkshire Hathaway may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those opportunities may not be available to us.
Financial Risks
Our level of indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business and financial
condition.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Our
existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements,
acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;
•resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, including our commercial paper programs, liquidity,
and access to capital markets;
•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as
highly leveraged;
•making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;
•requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, payments of dividends, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;
•exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency, as we earn profits in a variety of foreign currencies and the majority of our debt is
denominated in U.S. dollars; and
•in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.
In addition, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future debt or equity financings may not be available to us to enable us to pay our
indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to
refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable
terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Our debt instruments contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit
facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”) to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)). The
creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the
maturity of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and
file our periodic reports with the SEC, we have in the past needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our debt
instruments to avoid being in default.
If we breach any covenants under our debt instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors, or we may not
be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our debt
instruments and unable to access our Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain creditors could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be
forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
13
Additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition
and results of operations.
As of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance
primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter,
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying
amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market
share, increased input costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for
example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in
operating results, significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in
management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test
brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand
exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting
units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating
the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry,
economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount
rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could
be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins
are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if
management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units or
brands might become impaired in the future, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. Furthermore, changes in reporting units,
including as a result of integrating a new acquisition into an existing reporting unit that has a fair value below carrying amount of goodwill, have led, and
could in the future lead, to an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead,
to goodwill or intangible asset impairments.
Reporting units and brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the annual impairment test we performed as of June 26, 2022
(the “Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test”) have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the
future. Reporting units with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $16.4 billion as of
the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Taste, Meals, and Away from Home (TMA), Canada and North America Coffee (CNAC), and
Continental Europe. Reporting units with between 20-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $14.5 billion as
of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts (FBD), Northern Europe, Asia, and Latin America (LATAM). Brands
with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of $16.6 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment
Test and included Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Miracle Whip, Ore-Ida, Maxwell House, Cool Whip, Jet Puffed, and Plasmon. The aggregate carrying amount of
brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $2.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test. Although the remaining brands,
with a carrying value of $19.4 billion, have more than 50% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these
amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated
balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts
are also susceptible to impairments.
Our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international markets. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi,
Indonesian rupiah, Russian ruble, and New Zealand dollar. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates from period to period, which have been more volatile recently, will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented
foreign currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be
successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances,
we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with our
international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.
14
Commodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar
and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and
use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use other inputs, such as electricity, natural gas, and
water, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, including diesel fuel, which influence both our packaging and transportation
costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global
competition for resources, inflationary pressure, foreign currency fluctuations, severe weather, natural disasters, global climate change, water risk,
pandemics, crop failures, crop shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes
in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may
be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which
could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to
changes in cross-currency transaction rates. In addition, disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine
have caused, and could continue to cause, increased volatility of commodity and energy costs. Rising commodity, energy, and other input costs could
materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of our products, which could materially
and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Although we monitor our exposure to commodity and other input prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge
against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may
not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult
because dairy futures markets are not as liquid as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of
commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of
our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes, or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by
competitive and consumer pressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs,
then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
In 2022, we continued to experience higher commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due
to inflationary pressures. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. Although we take measures to
mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains, if these measures are not effective our financial condition, operating
results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, we expect that there could be a difference between the
timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred. Additionally, the pricing actions we take
have, in some instances, negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our market share.
Volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility
in our gross profit and net income.
We use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, vegetable oils, coffee
beans, wheat products, corn products, sugar, meat products, and cocoa products. We recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these
commodity derivatives. We recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the
underlying input in our manufacturing process. We recognize the unrealized gains and losses on these commodity derivatives in general corporate expenses
until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results. Accordingly, changes in the values of our
commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income.
15
Regulatory Risks
Our compliance with laws and regulations, and related legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions, could expose us to significant liabilities and
damage our reputation.
As a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks.
Various laws and regulations govern our practices including, but not limited to, those related to advertising and marketing, product claims and labeling,
food production, environmental matters (including climate change), intellectual property, consumer protection and product liability, commercial disputes,
trade and export controls, anti-trust, data privacy, labor and employment, workplace health and safety, and tax. As a consequence, we face a heightened risk
of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the imposition of new laws, changes in laws or
regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are
made, manufactured, distributed, and sold have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures, and higher
production costs, adversely impacting our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, actions we have taken or may take, or
decisions we have made or may make, in response to pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), may result in investigations, legal claims, or
litigation against us. In addition, claims about the health impacts of consumption of our products, or ingredients, components, or substances present or
allegedly present in those products or packaging, have resulted in, and could in the future result in, us being subject to regulations, fines, lawsuits, or taxes
that could adversely impact our business.
As a result of any such legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions, we could be subject to monetary judgments, settlements, and civil and criminal
actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits, or activity restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect
our reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We evaluate these legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions
to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we
establish reserves and disclose relevant material litigation claims, legal proceedings, or regulatory enforcement actions as appropriate and in accordance
with SEC rules and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Our assessments and estimates are based on
the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from
our current assessments and estimates. In addition, even if a claim is unsuccessful, without merit, or not pursued to completion, the cost of defending
against or responding to such a claim, including expenses and management time, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, which could
negatively impact our business, investor confidence, and the price of our common stock.
If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process, and
report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us
to litigation, investigations, or penalties; negatively affect our liquidity, our access to capital markets, perceptions of our creditworthiness, our ability to
complete acquisitions, our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing
of periodic reports, or investor confidence in our financial reporting; or cause defaults, accelerations, or cross-accelerations under our debt instruments or
derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or to cure any breaches, any of which
may require management resources or cause our stock price to decline.
A downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings.
Our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term credit ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these credit ratings could limit
our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In
February 2020, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) affirmed our long-term credit rating of Baa3 with a negative outlook and Fitch Ratings
(“Fitch”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) downgraded our long-term credit rating from BBB- to BB+ with a stable outlook from Fitch and a negative
outlook from S&P. The downgrades by Fitch and S&P adversely affected our ability to access the commercial paper market. These downgrades did not
constitute a default or event of default under our debt instruments. Our long-term credit rating was upgraded from BB+ to BBB- by S&P in March 2022
and by Fitch in May 2022. Fitch upgraded our long-term debt credit rating from BBB- to BBB in November 2022. As of the date of this filing, our long-
term debt is rated BBB- by S&P, BBB by Fitch and Baa3 by Moody’s, with a positive outlook from S&P and a stable outlook from Fitch and Moody’s.
16
Registered Securities Risks
Sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including sales of our common stock by Berkshire Hathaway, or the
perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale
of additional equity securities. A sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened and could in the future happen, which could
also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets, which could increase the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Kraft Heinz, 3G Global Food Holdings, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the
Securities Act all registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by Berkshire
Hathaway and 3G Capital as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger. As of December 31, 2022, registrable shares represented approximately 34.5%
of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods, the registrable
shares are not subject to a “lock-up” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, offers and sales of a large number of
registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the registration
rights agreement. Sales of our common stock by Berkshire Hathaway to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being
traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.
Our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board and may be
limited by our financial condition, debt agreements, or limitations under Delaware law.
Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts
thereof will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, income, legal
requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, debt agreements, and other factors the Board deems relevant. The Board has previously decided,
and may in the future decide, in its sole discretion, to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For
these reasons, stockholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our
common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur.
General Risk Factors
Disruptions in the global economy caused by geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Escalation of geopolitical tensions related to military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other
things, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand, increased cyberattacks, and impacts on foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of
which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we do not have operations in Ukraine, and our business in
Russia generated approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine
has caused, and could continue to cause, negative impacts on our business and the global economy. Governments in the United States, Canada, United
Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Due in part to
the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, we have experienced shortages in certain materials and increased costs in commodities
including packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, corn products, and wheat products. The effects of current geopolitical conflicts,
including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as potential future geopolitical tensions, could heighten many of our known risks described in
this Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Unanticipated business disruptions and natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers, distributors, or regulators operate
could adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers or our results of operations.
We have a complex network of suppliers, owned and leased manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information
systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as
weather or other geological events or natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, or wild fires (whether as a result of climate
change or otherwise), raw material shortages, fires or explosions, political unrest, geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and
Ukraine), terrorism, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, generalized labor unrest or labor shortages, or pandemics (including
17
COVID-19), could damage or disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, distributors, or regulators.
These factors include, but are not limited to:
•natural disasters, labor strikes, or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the
delivery of our products; and
•illness of our workforce, or the workforce of third parties with which we do business, due to influenza or pandemics, could disrupt production of
our products in one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or cause our suppliers, vendors, distributors, or third-party manufacturers to fail to
meet their obligations to us.
These or other disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. While we insure against many of these
events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning, such insurance may not
compensate us for any losses incurred and our business continuity plans may not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner. To the extent we are
unable to respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution
locations; to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems; or to financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such
events, or effectively manage them if they occur, we may be late in delivering, or unable to deliver, products to our customers or to track orders, inventory,
receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers’ confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do
business.
Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other
nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, changes to major international trade arrangements, and
the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the
United States and in international locations where we do business include changes in laws, export and import restrictions, foreign currency exchange rates,
foreign currency devaluation, cash repatriation restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of
hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, political unrest, and military conflict. Such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions, and our
responses to them, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global
workforce.
We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our
ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both
within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel and a
diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. Unplanned turnover, failure to attract and develop
personnel with key emerging capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing skills, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership
positions, including the Chief Executive Officer position, could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Further, equity-
based compensation is a key component of our compensation program and essential for attracting and retaining qualified personnel. As a result, the lack of
positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key personnel. Changes in immigration laws and policies could
also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. Any such loss, failure, or limitation could adversely affect our product sales,
financial condition, and operating results.
We are significantly dependent on information technology, and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption,
misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to
manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information
technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns
due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events, or
other factors. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. If
our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or by
cyberattacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions,
reputational damage, transaction
18
errors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage,
litigation or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners,
customers, consumers, or suppliers. While we maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for security incidents, we cannot be certain that our
coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on financially reasonable terms, or at all, or that
any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss
of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of our ability to commercialize products developed through research and development
efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or
misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to
legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused
by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.
We are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving and developing regarding privacy, data protection, and data security,
including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Such laws and regulations, as well as
their interpretation and application, may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which can result in inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and similar regulations implemented in other non-U.S. geographies, adds a broad array of
requirements with respect to personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-
compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective in January 2023
and amended the CCPA, among other things, impose additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of California
residents. The CCPA and CPRA provide civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Similar legislation in Virginia,
Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, all of which have gone into effect or will go into effect during 2023, impose transparency and other obligations with
respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights. GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy and data protection
laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of non-compliance, which could result in substantial penalties.
Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.
Inflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market, increased employee turnover, and changes in the availability of our workers could increase labor costs,
which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing
employee benefits in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines
in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income
securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively
bargained wage and benefit agreements.
Furthermore, we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained
agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if
strikes or work stoppages or interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United
States.
We continue to observe a competitive labor market. Employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, and labor shortages in our supply chain
have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs and have, and could again, impact our ability to meet consumer demand, both of which
could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
19
Changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent
on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of
applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties
as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the United States, which
represents the majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other
regulatory reforms that may impact us. We continue to monitor the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and related regulatory developments to evaluate their
potential impact on our business, tax rate, and financial results. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a
global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The proposals aim to ensure a fairer distribution of profits
among countries and impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. It is not currently possible to accurately
determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, financial
condition, and business.
Significant judgment, knowledge, and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is
impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in geographic mix of income, changes
in expenses not deductible for tax, including impairment of goodwill, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although
we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, including transfer pricing matters, and any related litigation could be
materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) for income taxes for the years 2018 and 2019. We have received a draft economist report and expect to receive a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries asserting that our U.S. taxable income for 2018 and 2019 should have been higher,
which would result in additional U.S. tax expense for 2018 and 2019 plus interest and potential penalties. We intend to vigorously contest the position
taken by the IRS; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain, and if we are required to pay the IRS additional U.S. taxes, interest, and
potential penalties, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in
various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in
the period or periods for which that determination is made.
Volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business.
Changes in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as
well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. Additionally, some of our customers, suppliers, and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in
some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition
and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant
adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer, supplier, or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that
customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate co-headquarters are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois. Our co-headquarters are leased and house certain executive
offices, our U.S. business units, and our administrative, finance, legal, and human resource functions. We maintain additional owned and leased offices
throughout the regions in which we operate.
We manufacture our products in our network of manufacturing and processing facilities located throughout the world. As of December 31, 2022, we
operated 78 manufacturing and processing facilities. We own 72 and lease six of these facilities. Our manufacturing and processing facilities count by
segment as of December 31, 2022 was:
Owned Leased
North America 32 3
International 40 3
20
We maintain all of our manufacturing and processing facilities in good condition and believe they are suitable and are adequate for our present needs. We
also enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with third parties if we determine it is advantageous to outsource the production of any of our products.
In 2022, we transferred ownership of our facility in Ontario, Oregon as part of a long-term third-party manufacturing agreement in our North America
segment. Additionally, we divested certain assets and operations associated with our business-to-business powdered cheese business in our North America
segment, including, among other things, a manufacturing facility in Albany, Minnesota. We also acquired one owned manufacturing facility in our
International segment. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on
our acquisitions and divestitures.

PART II

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Objective:
The following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective and should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Our objective is to also provide discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to
cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition and to offer information that provides an
understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
See below for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. See Item 7, Management’s
Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for
a detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020.
Description of the Company:
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products throughout the world.
In the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North
America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by
streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable
segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
See Note 20, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our financial information by segment.
Acquisitions and Divestitures:
In 2022, we completed the acquisition of Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (the “Hemmer Acquisition”) and Just Spices GmbH (the “Just Spices
Acquisition”), both of which are in our International segment. Additionally, in 2022, we completed the sale of our business-to-business powdered cheese
business (the “Powdered Cheese Transaction”). The Powdered Cheese Transaction is not considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our
operations or financial results; therefore, the results of this business are included in continuing operations through the date of sale.
In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Assan Gıda Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. (the “Assan Foods Acquisition”) and BR Spices Indústria e Comércio de
Alimentos Ltda (the “BR Spices Acquisition”), both of which are in our International segment. Additionally, in 2021, we completed the sale of certain
assets in our global nuts business (the “Nuts Transaction”) as well as the sale of certain assets in our global cheese businesses (the “Cheese Transaction”).
The Nuts Transaction and the Cheese Transaction are not, individually or in the aggregate, considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our
operations or financial results; therefore, the results of these businesses are included in continuing operations through the date of each sale in the prior year
period.
See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine:
For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 1% of consolidated net sales, net income/(loss), and Adjusted EBITDA were generated from our
business in Russia. For the year ended December 25, 2021, approximately 1% of consolidated net sales were generated from our business in Russia, while
net income/(loss) and Adjusted EBITDA were each insignificant. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,100 employees in Russia. We have no
operations or employees in Ukraine and insignificant net sales through distributors. Further, we have experienced cost increases globally for certain
commodities, including packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, corn products, and wheat products due to overall market demand,
inflationary pressures, and, in part, to the negative impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the global economy. We will continue to monitor
the impact that this conflict has on our business; however, through 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not have a material impact on our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
23
Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results
Impairment Losses:
Our results of operations reflect goodwill impairment losses of $444 million, intangible asset impairment losses of $469 million, and property, plant, and
equipment, net asset impairment losses of $86 million in 2022 compared to goodwill impairment losses of $318 million and intangible asset impairment
losses of $1.3 billion in 2021. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information on these impairment losses.
53rd Week:
We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Our 2022 fiscal year ended December 31, 2022
includes a 53rd week of activity. Our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021.
Inflation and Supply Chain Impacts:
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to experience increasing commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement,
logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to inflationary pressures, as compared to the prior year period. We expect these costs to continue to increase
and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. While these costs have a negative impact on our results of operations, we are currently taking measures to
mitigate, and expect to continue to take measures to mitigate, the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains. However, there has
been, and we expect that there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and
when the cost inflation is incurred. Additionally, the pricing actions we take have, in some instances, negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively
impact, our market share.
Further, given the current level of demand for our products combined with industry-wide supply chain issues, we have experienced capacity constraints for
certain products when demand has exceeded our current manufacturing capacity. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, we continue to focus on
rebuilding inventory and expanding capacity through increased capital investments, which have resulted in an increased ability to meet customer demand.
However, these capacity constraints have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our market share, financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows, until we return to optimal service levels.
Results of Operations
We disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance
on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our
underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations to the most closely comparable financial measures presented in our consolidated
financial statements, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021:
Net sales increased 1.7% to $26.5 billion in 2022 compared to $26.0 billion in 2021, including the unfavorable impacts of acquisitions and divestitures (8.0
pp) and foreign currency (2.0 pp) and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 9.8% to $26.2 billion in 2022
compared to $23.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by higher pricing (13.2 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (3.4 pp). Pricing was
higher in both segments, while volume/mix was unfavorable in both segments.

(a)    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.
Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021:
Operating income/(loss) increased 5.0% to $3.6 billion in 2022 compared to $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily driven by higher pricing, lower non-cash
impairment losses in the current year period, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments, which more than offset higher supply
chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs (mainly in dairy, packaging
materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, and meat); the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures; unfavorable volume/mix; and an accrual
related to the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit.
Net income/(loss) increased 131.3% to $2.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.0 billion in 2021. This increase was driven by lower interest expense, the
operating income/(loss) factors discussed above, and lower tax expense, which more than offset unfavorable changes in other expense/(income).
•Interest expense was $921 million in 2022 compared to $2.0 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a $38 million net gain on
extinguishment of debt recognized in the current year period in connection with our debt repurchases in 2022 compared to a $917 million loss on
extinguishment of debt recognized in the prior year period in connection with our tender offers, debt redemptions, and debt repurchases in 2021.
The remaining change in interest expense was a decrease of approximately $171 million compared to the prior year period, as our aggregate
principal amount of senior notes was reduced by approximately $6.2 billion in 2021 through tender offers, redemptions, repurchases, and
repayments and approximately $1.5 billion in 2022 through repurchases and repayments.
•Our effective tax rate was 20.2% in 2022 compared to 40.1% in 2021. Our 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable geographic mix
of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain favorable items, primarily the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger
of certain foreign entities, the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws, and changes in estimates of certain 2021 U.S.
income and deductions. This impact was partially offset by the impact of certain unfavorable items, primarily non-deductible goodwill
impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), and the establishment of uncertain tax positions and
valuation allowance reserves. Our 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items, primarily the tax impacts related to
acquisitions and divestitures, which mainly reflect the impacts of the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction, partially offset by 2021 capital
losses; the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international and state tax rates, mainly an increase in U.K. tax rates; the
impact of the federal tax on GILTI; and non-deductible goodwill impairments. These impacts were partially offset by a favorable geographic mix
of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
•Other expense/(income) was $253 million of income in 2022 compared to $295 million of income in 2021. This change was primarily driven by a
$79 million decrease in net pension and postretirement non-service benefits and a $25 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2022 compared to
a $44 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021. These impacts were partially offset by a $50 million net loss on derivative activities in 2022
compared to an $86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 and a $12 million increase in interest income as compared to the prior year
period.(a)
25
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.8% to $6.0 billion in 2022 compared to $6.4 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher supply chain costs, reflecting
inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs (mainly in dairy, packaging materials, soybean and
vegetable oils, energy, and meat); the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (6.1 pp); unfavorable volume/mix; and the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency (1.3 pp), which more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp).

Results of Operations by Segment
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from)
income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the
impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring
activities, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until
realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course
legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can
assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do
not directly reflect our underlying operations.
Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally
available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and
liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, as nonmonetary currency devaluation, rather than accumulated
other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. See
Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. We apply highly inflationary
accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey, which are all in our International segment.

Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021:
Net sales decreased 0.1% to $20.3 billion in 2022 compared to $20.4 billion in 2021, including the unfavorable impacts of divestitures (10.8 pp) and
foreign currency (0.4 pp), partially offset by the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 9.2% to $20.1 billion
in 2022 compared to $18.4 billion in 2021, driven by higher pricing (13.0 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (3.8 pp). Higher pricing was
primarily driven by increases to mitigate rising input costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to declines in frozen, meat, condiments and sauces,
coffee, ready-to-drink beverages, and desserts.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.2% to $5.3 billion in 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher commodity costs (mainly in
dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, meat, and energy); higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement,
logistics, and manufacturing costs; the unfavorable impact of the Cheese Transaction and Nuts Transaction (6.7 pp); unfavorable volume/mix; and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.2 pp). These decreases to Segment Adjusted EBITDA more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the

Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021:
Net sales increased 8.0% to $6.1 billion in 2022 compared to $5.7 billion in 2021, including the favorable impacts of acquisitions and divestitures (2.8 pp)
and a 53rd week of shipments (1.7 pp) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (8.1 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 11.6% to $6.2 billion in 2022
compared to $5.6 billion in 2021, driven by higher pricing (13.5 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (1.9 pp). Higher pricing included
increases across markets primarily to mitigate rising input costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to declines across categories in Australia and
New Zealand, declines in boxed dinners and condiments and sauces in the United Kingdom, and declines in condiments and sauces and infant nutrition in
Russia, which more than offset higher foodservice sales across most markets and growth in Brazil.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.6% to $1.0 billion in 2022 compared to $1.1 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher supply chain costs, reflecting
inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs, including in packaging and energy; the unfavorable
impact of foreign currency (7.2 pp); and unfavorable volume/mix, which more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a
53rd week of shipments (1.6 pp).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to
meet our working capital needs, repayments of long-term debt, future contractual obligations, payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends, planned
capital expenditures, restructuring expenditures, and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans for the next 12 months. An additional potential
source of liquidity is access to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements.
Acquisitions and Divestitures:
In the first quarter of 2022, we closed the Just Spices Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $243 million. In the second quarter of 2022, we
closed the Hemmer Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $279 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received approximately $108 million of cash consideration following the closing of the Powdered Cheese Transaction.
In the second quarter of 2021, we received approximately $3.4 billion of cash consideration following the closing of the Nuts Transaction. In connection
with the Nuts Transaction, we paid approximately $700 million of cash taxes in the second half of 2021, primarily to U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
We primarily utilized the post-tax transaction proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund opportunistic repayments of long-term debt, including our tender
offers in the second quarter of 2021 and our debt redemption and open market debt repurchases in the third quarter of 2021.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approximately $3.2 billion of cash consideration following the closing of the Cheese Transaction. In connection
with the Cheese Transaction, we paid approximately $620 million of cash taxes in the second quarter of 2022, primarily to U.S. federal and state tax
authorities. We primarily utilized the post-tax transaction proceeds to fund our open market debt repurchases and tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the Assan Foods Acquisition, which included cash consideration of approximately $70 million,
and the BR Spices Acquisition for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our acquisitions and
divestitures. See Note 16, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our debt transactions.(a)

Cash Flow Activity for 2022 Compared to 2021:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $5.4 billion for the year ended December 25,
2021. This decrease was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction in 2021, higher cash outflows for
inventories, primarily related to stock rebuilding, increased input costs, and the acceleration of payments to suppliers attributed to the wind-down of our
existing product financing arrangements, as well as lower Adjusted EBITDA. These impacts were partially offset by lower cash outflows for interest
primarily due to the reduction of long-term debt throughout 2022 and 2021.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash used for investing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $4.0
billion for the year ended December 25, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by proceeds from the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction in 2021,
as well as payments for the Just Spices Acquisition and Hemmer Acquisition in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by increased proceeds from the
settlement of net investment hedges and proceeds from the Powdered Cheese Transaction in 2022. We had 2022 capital expenditures of $916 million
compared to 2021 capital expenditures of $905 million. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion, primarily driven by capital
investments for capacity expansion, maintenance, cost improvement and innovation projects, and technology.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 25,
2021. This change was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt and debt prepayment and extinguishment costs in 2021 related to our tender
offers, debt repurchases, and debt redemptions in 2021. See Note 16, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional
information on our debt repayments.
Cash Held by International Subsidiaries:
Of the $1.0 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022, $707 million was held by international subsidiaries.
Subsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be
indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international
operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed, if repatriated, related to our 2018 through 2022 accumulated
earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately $50 million.
Our undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Related to
these undistributed historic earnings, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $90 million of historic
earnings at December 31, 2022 and a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $135 million of historic earnings at
December 25, 2021. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed.
Trade Payables Programs:
In order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of
payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 200 days. We also
maintain agreements with third party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the
supplier, sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter
into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and
scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We estimate that the amounts outstanding under these
programs were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $820 million at December 25, 2021.
Product Financing Arrangements:
We enter into various product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to wind-down our
existing product financing arrangements, with final impacts of the wind-down expected to extend into 2023. We continue to have access to these programs
to facilitate supply from our vendors in the future, if we choose to do so. See Note 14, Financing Arrangements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information on our product financing arrangements.
30
Borrowing Arrangements:
As of the date of this filing, our long-term debt is rated BBB- by S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), BBB by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) and Baa3 by Moody’s
Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), with a positive outlook from S&P and a stable outlook from Fitch and Moody’s. In February 2020, Fitch and S&P
downgraded our long-term credit rating from BBB- to BB+. These downgrades adversely affected our ability to access the commercial paper market. These
downgrades did not constitute a default or event of default under any of our debt instruments. Our ability to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility was not
affected by the downgrades. Our long-term credit rating was upgraded from BB+ to BBB- by S&P in March 2022 and by Fitch in May 2022. Fitch
upgraded our long-term debt credit rating from BBB- to BBB in November 2022.
From time to time, we obtain funding through our commercial paper programs. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022, at
December 25, 2021, or during the year ended December 25, 2021. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended
December 31, 2022 was $198 million, under our U.S. commercial paper program.
Our Senior Credit Facility provides for a revolving commitment of $4.0 billion through July 8, 2027. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the
amount of revolving commitments and/or add tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion.
No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2022, our previous credit facility (the “Previous Senior Credit Facility”) at
December 25, 2021, or on either the Senior Credit Facility or Previous Senior Credit Facility during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25,
2021.
Our credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could, upon the
occurrence of certain events of default, restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of
December 31, 2022.
Long-Term Debt:
Our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $20.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $21.8 billion at December 25, 2021. This decrease was
primarily due to approximately $315 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes that were repaid at maturity in August 2022,
approximately $381 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in June 2022, approximately $6 million aggregate
principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in March 2022, and approximately $755 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
repurchased in connection with the debt repurchases in 2022, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign-denominated debt. We
used cash on hand to fund our debt repurchases in 2022 and to pay related fees and expenses.
We have aggregate principal amounts of senior notes of approximately 750 million euros maturing in June 2023.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, tender offers, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancing,
exchange offers, open market or privately negotiated transactions, Rule 10b5-1 plans, or otherwise.
Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of
December 31, 2022.
See Note 16, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our long-term debt activity.
Equity and Dividends:
We paid dividends on our common stock of $2.0 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, our Board declared
a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2023.
The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
31
Aggregate Contractual Obligations:
Related to our current and long-term material cash requirements, the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31,
2022, which we expect to primarily fund with cash from operating activities (in millions):
Material Cash Requirements
2023 2024-2025 2026-20272028 and
Thereafter Total
Long-term debt $ 1,690 $ 2,322 $ 5,319 $ 24,656 $ 33,987

Operating leases 150 223 160 292 825 
Purchase obligations 487 766 297 261 1,811 
Other long-term liabilities 57 142 38 135 372 
Total $ 2,414 $ 3,487 $ 5,833 $ 25,412 $ 37,146 
(a)    Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on long-term debt.
(b)    Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our finance leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense.
(c)    Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases net of sublease income.
(d)    We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal
course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. Arrangements are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the
transaction. Several of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result,
actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts
contain penalty provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical
experience and current expectations.
(e)    Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to 2017 U.S. tax reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other
long-term liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate
the timing of payments for these items.
Pension plan contributions were $11 million in 2022. We estimate that 2023 pension plan contributions will be approximately $11 million. Postretirement
benefit plan contributions were $12 million in 2022. We estimate that 2023 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $12 million.
Estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions, which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected
contributions for 2023. Beyond 2023, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension or postretirement plans. Our actual
contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility,
significant differences between expected and actual pension or postretirement asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated
pension and postretirement plan contributions for 2023 have been excluded from the above table.
At December 31, 2022, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along
with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $555 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of
examinations with tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing
authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table.
Supplemental Guarantor Information:
The Kraft Heinz Company (as the “Parent Guarantor”) fully and unconditionally guarantees all the senior unsecured registered notes (collectively, the
“KHFC Senior Notes”) issued by Kraft Heinz Foods Company (“KHFC”), our 100% owned operating subsidiary (the “Guarantee”). See Note 16, Debt, in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional descriptions of these guarantees.
The payment of the principal, premium, and interest on the KHFC Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the
Parent Guarantor, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable indenture. None of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries guarantee the KHFC Senior
Notes.
The Guarantee is the Parent Guarantor’s senior unsecured obligation and is: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing
and future senior indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of the Parent Guarantor’s future subordinated indebtedness; (iii) effectively
subordinated to all of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets secured by that indebtedness;
and (iv) effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries.
The KHFC Senior Notes are obligations exclusively of KHFC and the Parent Guarantor and not of any of the Parent Guarantor’s other subsidiaries.
Substantially all of the Parent Guarantor’s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor’s other subsidiaries are separate legal
entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the KHFC(a)

Senior Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments. Except to the extent the Parent Guarantor is a
creditor with recognized claims against its subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of its
subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over its claims (and therefore the claims of its creditors, including holders of
the KHFC Senior Notes). Consequently, the KHFC Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries and
any subsidiaries that it may in the future acquire or establish. The obligations of the Parent Guarantor will terminate and be of no further force or effect in
the following circumstances: (i) (a) KHFC’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or, except in the case of a guarantee of any direct or indirect parent of
KHFC, covenant defeasance option in accordance with the applicable indenture, or KHFC’s obligations under the applicable indenture have been
discharged in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture or (b) as specified in a supplemental indenture to the applicable indenture; and (ii) the
Parent Guarantor has delivered to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the
applicable indenture have been complied with. The Guarantee is limited by its terms to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer
or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
The following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Guarantor and KHFC (as subsidiary issuer of the KHFC Senior Notes)
(together, the “Obligor Group”), on a combined basis after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions between the Parent Guarantor and
subsidiary issuer and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor.

Commodity Trends
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar
and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and
use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the
manufacturing and distribution of our products. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced higher commodity costs primarily for dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils,
energy (including diesel fuel, electricity, and natural gas), and meat as compared to the prior year period. These increases were primarily driven by overall
market demand, inflationary pressures, and, in part, by the negative impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the global economy. We
anticipate commodity costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through
pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market
price trends.
In 2022, dairy commodities, primarily milk, cream, and cheese, were the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy
raw material requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as
well as government programs, significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components of our meat products
include pork, beef, and poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for
U.S. meats influence the prices of these meat products.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting
policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as
accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges
that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as
reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period
experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives.
Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as
being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current
period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to
operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual
experience and other information. Our definition of advertising expenses includes advertising production costs, in-store advertising costs, agency fees,
brand promotions and events, and sponsorships, in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We
recorded advertising expenses of $945 million in 2022, $1,039 million in 2021, and $1,070 million in 2020. We also incur market research costs, which are
recorded in SG&A but are excluded from advertising expenses.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
As of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. These seven reporting units had an aggregate
goodwill carrying amount of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual
brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2022.
34
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a
sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections,
disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a
customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, significant adverse changes in the
markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for
impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the
estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record
an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying
amount of goodwill. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of the timing
of the annual impairment test.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating
the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry,
economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount
rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could
be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins
are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if
management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units or
brands might become impaired in the future. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to
goodwill or intangible asset impairments.
As detailed in Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we recorded impairment losses related to
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting
in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates. Accordingly, these and other reporting units and brands that have
20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of future impairments if any
assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future.
Reporting units with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $16.4 billion as of the Q3
2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Taste, Meals, and Away from Home (TMA), Canada and North America Coffee (CNAC), and Continental
Europe. Reporting units with between 20-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $14.5 billion as of the Q3
2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts (FBD), Northern Europe, Asia, and Latin America (LATAM). Our reporting
units that have less than 1% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test are considered at a heightened risk of future
impairments and include our CNAC and Continental Europe reporting units, which had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $2.4
billion. Our four remaining reporting units had no goodwill carrying amount at the time of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test.
Brands with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of $16.6 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual
Impairment Test and included Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Miracle Whip, Ore-Ida, Maxwell House, Cool Whip, Jet Puffed, and Plasmon. The aggregate carrying
amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $2.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test. Although the
remaining brands, with a carrying amount of $19.4 billion, have more than 50% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual
Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of
acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors
change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments. Our brands that have less than 5% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the
Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test are considered at a heightened risk of future impairments and include our Kraft, Ore-Ida, Jet Puffed, and Plasmon
brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $11.3 billion.
We generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Some of the more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit (including net sales,
cost of products sold, SG&A, depreciation and amortization, working capital, and capital expenditures), income tax rates, long-term growth rates, and a
discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using
historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management’s plans, and guideline
companies.
35
We utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands. Some of the more significant
assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales, cost of products
sold, and SG&A), contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated
with the future earnings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in the
financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates,
management’s plans, and guideline companies.
We utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands. Some of the more significant
assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand, royalty rates (as a percentage of net sales
that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee), income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount rate
that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We
selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product
category growth rates, management’s plans, and guideline companies.
As detailed in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Cheese Transaction closed in the fourth
quarter of 2021. We received total consideration of approximately $3.3 billion, which included approximately $1.6 billion primarily attributed to the Kraft
and Velveeta licenses that we granted to Lactalis and approximately $141 million attributed to the Cracker Barrel license that Lactalis granted to us, the
amounts of which were based on the estimated fair values of the licensed portion of each brand as of the closing date of the Cheese Transaction.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, at the time the licensed rights were granted, we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the Kraft and
Velveeta brands and recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment loss related to the Kraft brand of approximately $1.24 billion, which was recognized
in SG&A.
The discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and our brands with 20% or less excess
fair value over carrying amount, as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts, as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test for each reporting unit or
brand, were as follows:
Goodwill or Brand
Carrying Amount
 (in billions)Discount Rate Long-Term Growth Rate Royalty Rate
Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum
Reporting units $ 16.4 7.0 % 8.0 % 1.5 % 2.0 %
Brands
 (excess earnings method) 14.9 7.7 % 7.8 % 1.0 % 1.5 %
Brands
 (relief from royalty method) 1.7 7.5 % 8.5 % 0.5 % 2.0 % 4.0 % 20.0 %
Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the
facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not
change in isolation. However, as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur, as a sensitivity measure, we have presented the
estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates on the fair values of our reporting units and brands with
20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount. These estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that
would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline.
If we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying
amount, as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test for each of these reporting units and brands, these isolated changes, which are reasonably possible to
occur, would have led to the following increase/(decrease) in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands (in billions):
Discount Rate Long-Term Growth Rate Royalty Rate
50-Basis-Point 25-Basis-Point 100-Basis-Point
Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease
Reporting units $ (2.8)$ 3.4 $ 1.4 $ (1.3)
Brands (excess earnings method) (1.2) 1.4 0.5 (0.5)
Brands (relief from royalty method) (0.1) 0.2 0.1 (0.1)$ 0.2 $ (0.2)
36
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment
exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible
assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our impairment testing results.
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.
The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of
the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive.
For our postretirement benefit plans, our 2023 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.6%. We established this rate based upon our most recent
experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be
4.8%. The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2023 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates
have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
Our 2023 discount rate assumption will be 5.5% for service cost and 5.4% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2023 discount rate assumption
will be 5.7% for service cost and 5.5% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 5.3% for service cost and 5.0% for interest cost for our non-U.S.
pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future
cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.
Our 2023 expected return on plan assets will be 6.3% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2023 expected rate of return on plan assets
will be 6.6% for our U.S. pension plans and 5.1% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan
assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt
to maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments.
While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2023 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, as a sensitivity
measure, a 100-basis-point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following
effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions):

Income Taxes:
We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn
income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit
for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit
that we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of
recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax
rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information
that has become available after the balance sheet date, however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to
our financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and
the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting. These unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other non-current liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for
valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead
to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the
change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation
allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position.

Contingencies

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP.
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA,
and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-
GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These
measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted EPS, or other measures
prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision
making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. We believe that Organic Net
Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS provide important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess
the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis.
Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful
supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that
management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental
information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when
considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional
understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.
Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments.
We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate, with the exception of highly
inflationary subsidiaries, for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate.
38
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from)
income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the
impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring
activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and
equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities).
Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on
commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other
losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and
losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs, and certain significant discrete income tax items (e.g., U.S. and non-U.S. tax reform), and
including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these
exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that
principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in
commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management
strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative
instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.
When we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our
agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of
exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all
significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we
do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices: 
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency swap contracts,
assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions):
December 31,
 2022December 25,
 2021
Commodity contracts $ 94 $ 56 
Foreign currency contracts 71 130 
Cross-currency swap contracts 211 318 
It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in
the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would
change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is
consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt
issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Kraft Heinz Company
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2022 and December 25, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
44
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Goodwill Impairment Assessments
As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $30.8 billion as of December 31,
2022. Historically, management tested reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022
and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Reporting
units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the
associated carrying amount of goodwill. Management recognized non-cash goodwill impairment losses of $444 million for the year ended December 31,
2022. Management utilizes the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of reporting units. As disclosed by
management, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, selling, general, and
administrative costs (SG&A), depreciation and amortization, working capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, discount rates, long-term growth rates,
and other market factors.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are
(i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and
effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount rates, and
long-term growth rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including
controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for
developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method; (iii) testing the completeness and
accuracy of underlying data used in the method; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount
rates and long-term growth rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount rates and long-term
growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the
reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in
other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company’s discounted cash flow
method and (ii) the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments
As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance, which
consists primarily of individual brands, was $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Historically, management tested brands for impairment annually as of
the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than
its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment
assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Brands are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a brand exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value
and carrying amount. Management recognized non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $462 million for the year ended December
31, 2022. As disclosed by management, management utilizes either an excess earnings method or relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value of its
brands. Using the excess earnings method, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions relating to net sales, cost of products sold,
SG&A, contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors. Using the relief from
royalty method, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, royalty rates, income tax considerations, long-
term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors.
45
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment is a
critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A,
long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the
relief from royalty method; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment
assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i)
testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the excess earnings and relief from royalty
methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the methods; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by
management related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales,
royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to net sales, cost
of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and
discount rates for the relief from royalty method involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the
current and past performance of the individual brands; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were
consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i)
the Company’s excess earnings and relief from royalty methods and (ii) the royalty rate for the relief from royalty method and long-term growth rate and
discount rate assumptions for the excess earnings method and relief from royalty method.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
Organization
On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into
a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The
Kraft Heinz Company. Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings, LP,
following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the “2013 Heinz Acquisition”).
We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on
December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that
ended on December 26, 2020.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company and all of our controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are
eliminated.
Reportable Segments
In the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North
America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by
streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable
segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves,
and expenses. These accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy
elections, estimates, and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We
believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and
circumstances dictate. Market volatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As
future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from
estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate
differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
We made reclassifications and adjustments to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.
Held for Sale
At December 31, 2022, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily relating to land use rights across the globe.
At December 25, 2021, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, including inventory in our International segment and
certain manufacturing equipment and land use rights across the globe.
52
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash equivalents include term deposits with banks, money market funds, and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. Cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage are
classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash recorded in other non-current
assets was $1 million at December 31, 2022 and $1 million at December 25, 2021. Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $1,041 million at
December 31, 2022 and $3,446 million at December 25, 2021.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges
that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as
reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period
experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives.
Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as
being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current
period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to
operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual
experience and other information. Our definition of advertising expenses includes advertising production costs, in-store advertising costs, agency fees,
brand promotions and events, and sponsorships, in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We
recorded advertising expenses of $945 million in 2022, $1,039 million in 2021, and $1,070 million in 2020. We also incur market research costs, which are
recorded in SG&A but are excluded from advertising expenses.
Research and Development Expense:
We expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $127 million
in 2022, $140 million in 2021, and $119 million in 2020.
Stock-Based Compensation:
We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which is generally three to five
years, or on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards. These costs are primarily recognized
within SG&A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We
classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 10, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, for additional
information.
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.
The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of
the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 11, Postemployment Benefits, for
additional information.
53
Income Taxes:
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference
between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss
carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities,
and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected
ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for
valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead
to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the
change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and
changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.
Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-
in capital.
Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.
Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three years to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years.
Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment if we have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time and
it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with a third party to host the software. These costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when
conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in
the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group
will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When
testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is
determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated
proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Hosted Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract:
Deferred implementation costs for hosted cloud computing service arrangements are stated at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the hosting arrangement that the implementation costs relate to. Deferred implementation costs to be amortized during the next 12 months for these
arrangements are included in prepaid expenses and amortized to SG&A. All remaining amounts to be amortized are included in other non-current assets.
The corresponding cash flows related to these arrangements will be reported within operating activities. We review the deferred implementation costs for
impairment when we believe the deferred costs may no longer be recoverable. Such conditions could include situations where the arrangement is not
expected to provide substantive service potential, a significant change occurs in the manner in which the arrangement is used or expected to be used,
including early cancellation or termination of the arrangement, or situations where the arrangement has had, or will have, a significant change made to it. In
instances where we have concluded that an impairment exists, we accelerate the deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheet for immediate expense
recognition in SG&A.
54
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
We maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number
of individual brands. We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and
circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input
costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural
disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results,
significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy.
We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment
by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair
value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the
associated carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a
discussion of the timing of the annual impairment test.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment
exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible
assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
Leases:
We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially
all the economic benefit from and to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and
corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease
liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value
of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the
lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not
readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate (dependent on tenor and currency and adjusted to reflect
collateralization) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms
include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
We do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets.
We recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or the lease term. In instances of title transfer, expense is recognized over the useful
life. Interest expense on a finance lease is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to the lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping,
insurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset
classes. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs.
Certain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance and tax
payments. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease
liability and are recognized as expense in the period in which the payment occurs.
Our lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our leases.
55
Financial Instruments:
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management
strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our
operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use
highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments
and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss), in the same line item as the
underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the
same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to
hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these
derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method, with changes
reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The
excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement
classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the
contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the
consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item
as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities.
To qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at
inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness, we
reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) within other
expense/(income). We formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of
forecasted transactions, we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that
a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net
income/(loss) in the current period.
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included
within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized, the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note
12, Financial Instruments, for additional information.
Our designated and undesignated derivative contracts include:
•Net investment hedges. We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts,
foreign exchange contracts, and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. We exclude the interest accruals and any
off-market values on cross-currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and
measurement of hedge effectiveness. We recognize the interest accruals and any amortization of off-market values on cross-currency swap
contracts in net income/(loss) within interest expense. We amortize the forward points on foreign exchange contracts into net income/(loss) within
interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship.
56
•Foreign currency cash flow hedges. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party
and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the euro, British pound
sterling, and Canadian dollar. These instruments include cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts.
Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude the interest accruals
on cross-currency swap contracts (when interest is not a hedged item) and the forward points and option premiums or discounts on foreign
exchange contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness and amortize such amounts into net income/(loss) in the same
line item as the underlying hedged item over the life of the hedging relationship.
•Interest rate cash flow hedges. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate
risk management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our
future debt obligations.
•Commodity derivatives. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw
materials. We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products, vegetable oils, coffee beans, wheat products, corn products,
sugar, meat products, and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for
derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures, options, and
swaps to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including the commodities noted above, as well as diesel fuel, packaging
products, and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also occasionally use futures to
economically cross hedge a commodity exposure.
Translation of Foreign Currencies:
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange
rate in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for
the period.
Highly Inflationary Accounting:
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly
inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available
exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and
liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)
on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities
are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We applied highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela,
and Argentina which resulted in insignificant nonmonetary currency devaluation losses in other expense/(income) in the periods presented. The net
monetary assets of each of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina were insignificant at December 31, 2022. Our results of operations in
Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina reflect those of controlled subsidiaries.
Note 3. New Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers:
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 to amend the accounting
for contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business
Combinations. The guidance requires entities engaged in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets acquired and contract liabilities
assumed in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than at fair value on the acquisition date. The amendments also
apply to other contracts such as contract liabilities arising from nonfinancial assets under ASC 610-20, Other Income – Gains and Losses from the
Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim
period. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis. While the impact of these amendments is dependent
on the nature of any future transactions, we currently do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related
disclosures.
57
Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations:
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 to add disclosure requirements relative to supplier financing programs under ASC 405, Liabilities. The
guidance requires entities that maintain supplier financing programs to provide information in their financial statements about their use of supplier finance
programs and their effect on the entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Specifically, the amendment requires entities to disclose the key terms of
their programs, amounts outstanding, balance sheet presentation, and a rollforward of amounts outstanding during the annual period. Only the amount
outstanding at the end of the period is required to be disclosed in interim periods. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023, except
for the rollforward requirement, which is effective in fiscal year 2024. Early adoption is permitted. While we currently disclose the amounts outstanding on
our existing trade payables programs, we are reviewing the provisions of this new pronouncement but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact
on our financial statements and related disclosures.
Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
Hemmer Acquisition:
On March 31, 2022 (the “Hemmer Acquisition Date”), we acquired a majority of the outstanding equity interests of Companhia Hemmer Indústria e
Comércio (“Hemmer”), a Brazilian food and beverage manufacturing company focused on the condiments and sauces category, from certain third-party
shareholders (the “Hemmer Acquisition”).
The Hemmer Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to the
Hemmer Acquisition was approximately 1.3 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $279 million at the Hemmer Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling
interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets,
as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date. As of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, we acquired 94% of the outstanding shares of Hemmer. In the third quarter of
2022, we completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding shares and own 100% of the controlling interest in Hemmer.
We entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the cash consideration for the
Hemmer Acquisition. See Note 12, Financial Instruments, for additional information.
We utilized fair values at the Hemmer Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.
The fair value estimates of the assets acquired are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the Hemmer Acquisition
Date). The primary areas of accounting for the Hemmer Acquisition that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible net assets acquired,
residual goodwill, and any related tax impact. The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as
other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While we believe that such
preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we will evaluate any additional
information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period, we will adjust preliminary valuations assigned to assets and liabilities if
new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, that, if known, would have resulted in revised
values for these items as of that date. The impact of all changes, if any, that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be included in current
period earnings.

(a)    As reported in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 25, 2022.
The Hemmer Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $219 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Hemmer’s long-term experience and
large presence operating in emerging markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, a portion of the goodwill became tax deductible following the merger of
Hemmer into our existing legal entity structure. This goodwill was assigned to the Latin America (“LATAM”) reporting unit within our International
segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, certain insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary
amount of goodwill was adjusted to $215 million. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
The preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Hemmer Acquisition was:
Fair Value
 (in millions of
dollars)Weighted Average
Life
 (in years)
Definite-lived trademarks $ 101 13
Customer-related assets 21 15
Total $ 122 
We valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant
assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales,
cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk
inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the
assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category
growth rates, management’s plans, and market comparables.
We used carrying values as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they
represented the fair value of those items at such date.
Just Spices Acquisition:
On January 18, 2022 (the “Just Spices Acquisition Date”), we acquired 85% of the shares of Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”), a German-based company
focused on direct-to-consumer sales of premium spice blends, from certain third-party shareholders (the “Just Spices Acquisition”).(a)
59
The Just Spices Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to
the Just Spices Acquisition was approximately 214 million euros (approximately $243 million at the Just Spices Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling
interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets,
as of the Just Spices Acquisition Date. Under the terms of certain transaction agreements, Just Spices’ other equity holders each have a put option to require
us to purchase the remaining equity interests beginning three years after the Just Spices Acquisition Date. If the put option is not exercised, we have a call
option to acquire the remaining equity interests of Just Spices. Considering the contractual terms related to the noncontrolling interest, it is classified as
redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet.
Subsequent to the Just Spices Acquisition, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at the greater of the amount that would be paid if settlement
occurred as of the balance sheet date based on the contractually defined redemption value and its carrying amount adjusted for the net income/(loss)
attributable to the noncontrolling interest.
We utilized fair values at the Just Spices Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation for the Just Spices Acquisition was final as of December 31, 2022.
The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Just Spices Acquisition was (in millions):

The Just Spices Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $167 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Just Spices’ social media presence.
This goodwill was assigned to the Continental Europe reporting unit within our International segment. In the second quarter of 2022, certain insignificant
measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $163 million. We did not
record any measurement period adjustments in the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, additional insignificant measurement period
adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the final amount of goodwill was adjusted to $156 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized
the purchase accounting for the Just Spices Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.

We used carrying values as of the Just Spices Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they
represented the fair value of those items at such date.
Assan Foods Acquisition:
On October 1, 2021 (the “Assan Foods Acquisition Date”), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Assan Gıda Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş.
(“Assan Foods”), a condiments and sauces manufacturer based in Turkey, from third parties Kibar Holding Anonim Şirketi and a holder of registered
shares of Assan Foods (the “Assan Foods Acquisition”).
The Assan Foods Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total consideration related to the
Assan Foods Acquisition was approximately $79 million, including cash consideration of $70 million and contingent consideration of approximately
$9 million. We utilized fair values at the Assan Foods Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation for the Assan Foods Acquisition was final as of September 24, 2022.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Assan Foods Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $64 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to
additional capacity that the Assan Foods manufacturing facilities will provide for our brands in the EMEA East region. This goodwill was assigned to the
EMEA East reporting unit within our International segment. Following the measurement period adjustments made in the first quarter of 2022, the
preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $51 million as of March 26, 2022. In the second and third quarters of 2022, we did not record any
measurement period adjustments. In the third quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase accounting for the Assan Foods Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill
and Intangible Assets, for additional information.

We valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant
assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales,
cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk
inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the

We used carrying values as of the Assan Foods Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they
represented the fair value of those items at such date.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we extinguished approximately $29 million of the short- and long-term debt assumed as a part of the Assan Foods
Acquisition, resulting in approximately $1 million of long-term debt remaining related to the Assan Foods Acquisition at December 25, 2021. The loss on
extinguishment related to the repayment of this debt was insignificant. Cash payments related to debt extinguishment are classified as cash outflows from
financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Other Acquisitions:
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired a majority stake in BR Spices Indústria e Comércio de Alimentos Ltda. (“BR Spices”), a manufacturer of spices
and other seasonings in Brazil, for an insignificant amount of cash consideration (the “BR Spices Acquisition”). The noncontrolling interest associated with
BR Spices is included in redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.
Deal Costs:
Related to our acquisitions, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022 and 2021. We recognized these deal costs in SG&A. There were no deal costs
related to acquisitions in 2020.
Divestitures
Powdered Cheese Transaction:
In August 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Kerry Group, to sell our business-to-business powdered cheese business (the
“Powdered Cheese Transaction”). The net assets transferred in the Powdered Cheese Transaction include, among other things, the Albany, Minnesota
manufacturing facility (collectively, the “Powdered Cheese Disposal Group”).
The Powdered Cheese Transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2022 for total consideration of approximately $108 million. As a result of the Powered
Cheese Transaction closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of business of approximately $26 million.
Cheese Transaction:
In September 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (“Lactalis”), to sell certain assets in our global
cheese business, as well as to license certain trademarks, for total consideration of approximately $3.3 billion, including approximately $3.2 billion of cash
consideration and approximately $141 million related to a perpetual license for the Cracker Barrel brand that Lactalis granted to us for certain products (the
“Cheese Transaction”). The Cheese Transaction had two primary components. The first component related to the perpetual licenses for the Kraft and
Velveeta brands that we granted to Lactalis for certain cheese products (the “Kraft and Velveeta Licenses”), along with a three-year transitional license that
we granted to Lactalis for the Philadelphia brand (the “Philadelphia License” and collectively, the “Cheese Divestiture Licenses”). The second component
related to the net assets transferred to Lactalis (the “Cheese Disposal Group”). The Cheese Transaction closed on November 29, 2021 (the “Cheese
Transaction Closing Date”).
Of the $3.3 billion total consideration, approximately $1.6 billion was attributed to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses based on the estimated fair value of the
licensed portion of each brand. As of the Cheese Transaction Closing Date, the license income related to the Kraft and Velveeta Licenses will be recognized
over approximately 30 years and the license income related to the Philadelphia License will be recognized over approximately three years. Related to the
Cheese Divestiture Licenses, we recognized approximately $56 million of license income in 2022 and an insignificant amount of license income in 2021,
which was recorded as a reduction to SG&A and classified as divestiture-related license income. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we have recorded
approximately $1.5 billion in long-term deferred income and $56 million in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet related to the Cheese
Divestiture Licenses.
62
In the first quarter of 2022, we reimbursed Lactalis approximately $20 million following a final inventory count performed after the Cheese Transaction
closed. This amount reflects the difference between the estimated and actual value of inventory transferred, which was primarily driven by seasonal
fluctuations in finished goods. The payment to Lactalis was recognized in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022
as a cash outflow from investing activities in proceeds from sale of business, net of cash disposed and working capital adjustments.
In the second quarter of 2021, we assessed the fair value less costs to sell of the net assets of the Cheese Disposal Group and recorded an estimated pre-tax
loss on sale of business of approximately $27 million, which was recognized in other expense/(income).
Following the closing of the Cheese Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an incremental pre-tax gain on sale of business of $27 million
in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total gain/loss on sale of business related to the Cheese Transaction was insignificant. Additional considerations
related to the Cheese Transaction included the treatment of the Cheese Divestiture Licenses upon closing of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2021, at
the time the licensed rights were granted, we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands and recorded a
non-cash intangible asset impairment loss related to the Kraft brand of approximately $1.24 billion, which was recognized in SG&A.
See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25,
2021 for additional information related to the Cheese Transaction.
Nuts Transaction:
In February 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Hormel Foods Corporation, to sell certain assets in our global nuts business for
total consideration of approximately $3.4 billion (the “Nuts Transaction”). The net assets transferred in the Nuts Transaction included, among other things,
our intellectual property rights to the Planters brand and to the Corn Nuts brand, three manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the associated
inventories (collectively, the “Nuts Disposal Group”).
As of February 10, 2021, the date the Nuts Disposal Group was determined to be held for sale, we tested the individual assets included within the Nuts
Disposal Group for impairment. The net assets of the Nuts Disposal Group had an aggregate carrying amount above their $3.4 billion estimated fair value.
We determined that the goodwill within the Nuts Disposal Group was partially impaired. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of
$230 million, which was recognized in SG&A, in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we recorded an estimated pre-tax loss on sale of business of
$19 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily related to estimated costs to sell, which was recognized in other expense/(income).
The Nuts Transaction closed in the second quarter of 2021. As a result of the Nuts Transaction closing, we recognized an incremental pre-tax loss on sale of
business of $17 million in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income in the second quarter of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of
2021, we recorded insignificant adjustments to our estimated costs to sell, which resulted in an insignificant pre-tax gain on sale of business that was
recognized in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total pre-tax loss on sale of business for the Nuts Transaction was $34 million, all of which was
recognized in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income.
See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25,
2021 for additional information related to the Nuts Transaction.
Deal Costs:
Related to our divestitures, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recognized these deal costs in SG&A.
Note 5. Restructuring Activities
As part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee
benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, and pension and other
termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of, and
directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and
other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs
primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, costs to exit facilities, and costs associated with restructuring
benefit plans.
63
Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory
requirements, and historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable;
additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee’s required
future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their
normal service, in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a
new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale, and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair
value. All other costs are recognized as incurred.
Restructuring Activities:
We have restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on reducing our overall cost structure and streamlining our organizational design. In
2022, we eliminated approximately 575 positions related to these programs. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to eliminate approximately 560
additional positions in 2023, primarily outside of the United States and Canada. In 2022, restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $74 million and
included $34 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $12 million of asset-related costs, and $28 million of other implementation costs.
Restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $84 million in 2021 and income of $2 million in 2020.
Our net liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP was (in millions):
Severance and
Employee Benefit

Charges/(credits) 34 — 34 
Cash payments (33) (5) (38)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 28 $ 11 $ 39 
We expect the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 31, 2022 to be paid by the end of 2023. The liability for other exit costs
primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2023 and
2026.

Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Historically, we have tested our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. As discussed in further detail
below, we performed an annual test as of March 27, 2022, the first day of our second quarter (the “Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test”). Beginning in the
third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of our third quarter
and performed an additional annual impairment test as of June 26, 2022 (the “Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test”). We believe this measurement date,
which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, better aligns with the timing of our strategic business planning process and
financial forecasts, which are key components of the annual impairment tests and are typically completed in the third quarter of our fiscal year.
Goodwill:
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, were (in millions):

In the first quarter of 2022, we closed the Just Spices Acquisition in our International segment, which resulted in preliminary goodwill of $167 million.
Additionally, we recorded measurement period adjustments, primarily related to the Assan Foods Acquisition that impacted goodwill. The Assan Foods
Acquisition closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is in our International segment. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a net decrease to
goodwill on acquisitions of approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2022. However, as each of the affected reporting units (EMEA East and
LATAM in our International segment) had no goodwill balance remaining, we recorded a reduction of the $53 million non-cash impairment loss recorded
to SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2021 that fully impaired the goodwill related to the associated acquisitions and their respective reporting units. The
impairment reduction of $11 million, which reflects the measurement period adjustment of $15 million adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, was
recorded in SG&A in our International segment in the first quarter of 2022. Following these measurement period adjustments, there was no goodwill in the
EMEA East or Latin America reporting units. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. See
Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to these transactions and the related financial statement impacts.
In the second quarter of 2022, we closed the Hemmer Acquisition in our International segment, which resulted in preliminary goodwill of $219 million.
Additionally, we recorded insignificant measurement period adjustments related to the Just Spices Acquisition that impacted goodwill. These measurement
period adjustments resulted in a decrease to goodwill on acquisitions of approximately $4 million in the second quarter of 2022.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we divested goodwill of approximately $37 million related to the Powdered Cheese Transaction. Additionally, we recorded
measurement period adjustments related to the Just Spices Acquisition and Hemmer Acquisition that impacted goodwill. These measurement period
adjustments were recorded in our International segment and resulted in a decrease to goodwill on acquisition of approximately $11 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022.
At December 26, 2020, goodwill excluded amounts classified as held for sale related to the Cheese Transaction, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Additionally, the 2021 amounts included in divestitures in the table above represent the goodwill that was previously reclassified to assets held for sale and
tested and determined to be partially impaired in connection with the Nuts Transaction. The resulting impairment loss of $230 million was recognized in
the first quarter of 2021. The Nuts Transaction closed in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information
related to the Cheese Transaction and the Nuts Transaction and their financial statement impacts.
2022 Goodwill Impairment Testing
As described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our
United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable
segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
The reorganization of our internal reporting and reportable segments changed the composition of certain of our reporting units wherein certain of our
existing United States reporting units (primarily Enhancers, Specialty, and Away From Home (“ESA”); Kids, Snacks, and Beverages (“KSB”); Meal
Foundations and Coffee (“MFC”); and Puerto Rico) and our existing Canada reporting units (Canada Retail and Canada Foodservice) have been
reorganized into the following new North America reporting units: Taste, Meals, and Away From Home (“TMA”); Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts
(“FBD”); Canada and North America Coffee (“CNAC”); and Other North America.
As a result of this reorganization, we reassigned assets and liabilities to the applicable reporting units and allocated goodwill using the relative fair value
approach. We performed an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis.
We performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of March 27, 2022, which was our first day of the second quarter of 2022. There were six
reporting units affected by the reassignment of assets and liabilities that maintained a goodwill balance as of our pre-reorganization impairment test date.
These reporting units were ESA, KSB, MFC, Puerto Rico, Canada Retail, and Canada Foodservice. One other reporting unit did not have a goodwill
balance as of our pre-reorganization impairment test date.
66
As part of our pre-reorganization impairment test, we utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair values as of
March 27, 2022 for the six reporting units noted above. As a result of our pre-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of
approximately $235 million in SG&A in our North America segment in the second quarter of 2022. This included a $221 million impairment loss related to
our Canada Retail reporting unit, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $1.2 billion after impairment, and a $14 million impairment loss
related to our Puerto Rico reporting unit, which represented all of the goodwill associated with the Puerto Rico reporting unit. The impairment of our
Canada Retail reporting unit was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate, which was impacted by higher interest rates and other market inputs,
as well as a revised downward outlook for operating margin. The impairment of our Puerto Rico reporting unit was primarily driven by a revised
downward outlook for operating margin. The other four reporting units for which no impairment charge was required were as follows: ESA, which had a
goodwill carrying amount of approximately $11.4 billion; KSB, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $9.3 billion; MFC, which had a
goodwill carrying amount of approximately $6.0 billion; and Canada Foodservice, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $158 million.
We performed our post-reorganization impairment test in conjunction with our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test and tested the new North America
reporting units (TMA, FBD, CNAC, and Other North America) along with the reporting units in our International segment. The new North America
reporting units’ goodwill carrying amounts for the post-reorganization and Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test reflected the pre-reorganization test results,
including impairments recorded. We tested our reporting units for impairment as of the first day of our second quarter, which was March 27, 2022 for our
Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test. In performing this test, we incorporated information that was known through the date of filing of our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 25, 2022. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our
reporting units. As a result of our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units tested was in excess of
its carrying amount.
We performed our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of June 26, 2022, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2022. In performing this test, we
incorporated information that was known through the date of filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 24, 2022. We
utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our Q3 2022 Annual
Impairment Test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $220 million in SG&A in our North America segment related to our CNAC
reporting unit. The impairment of our CNAC reporting unit was primarily driven by reduced revenue growth assumptions and negative macroeconomic
factors, including increased interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
As of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. These seven reporting units had an aggregate
goodwill carrying amount of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2022. As of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, our reporting units with 20% or less fair
value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $16.4 billion and included TMA, CNAC, and Continental
Europe; and our reporting units with between 20%-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $14.5 billion and
included FBD, Northern Europe, Asia, and LATAM.
Accumulated impairment losses to goodwill were $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $10.9 billion at December 25, 2021.
2021 Goodwill Impairment Testing
In the first quarter of 2021, we announced the Nuts Transaction and determined that the Nuts Disposal Group was held for sale. Accordingly, based on a
relative fair value allocation, we reclassified $1.7 billion of goodwill to assets held for sale, which included a portion of goodwill from four of our reporting
units. The Nuts Transaction primarily affected our KSB reporting unit but also affected, to a lesser extent, our ESA, Canada Foodservice, and Puerto Rico
reporting units. These reporting units were evaluated for impairment prior to their representative inclusion in the Nuts Disposal Group as well as on a post-
reclassification basis. The fair value of all reporting units was determined to be in excess of their carrying amounts in both scenarios and, therefore, no
impairment was recorded.
We performed our 2021 annual impairment test as of March 28, 2021, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2021. We utilized the discounted
cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2021 annual impairment test, we
recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $35 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2021 related to our Puerto Rico reporting unit
within our North America segment. With the update of our five-year operating plan in the second quarter of 2021, we established a revised downward
outlook for net sales for this reporting unit. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information on this impairment loss.
67
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the Assan Foods Acquisition and the BR Spices Acquisition, both in our International segment. We assigned
the goodwill related to the Assan Foods Acquisition to our EMEA East reporting unit and the goodwill related to the BR Spices Acquisition to our LATAM
reporting unit. Prior to these acquisitions, the EMEA East and LATAM reporting units had no goodwill carrying amounts due to previous impairments. The
acquisitions changed the composition of each of the reporting units, triggering an interim impairment test. We determined that the carrying amount of each
reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of December 25, 2021. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $53 million in SG&A in our
International segment, which represented all of the goodwill of the EMEA East and LATAM reporting units.
2020 Goodwill Impairment Testing
In the first quarter of 2020, following changes to our internal reporting and reportable segments, the composition of certain of our reporting units changed,
and we performed an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis.
We performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of December 29, 2019, which was our first day of 2020. There were no impairment losses
resulting from our pre-reorganization impairment test.
We performed our post-reorganization impairment test as of December 29, 2019. There were six reporting units in scope for our post-reorganization
impairment test: Northern Europe, Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (“ANJ”), LATAM, and Puerto Rico. As a result of our
post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $226 million in SG&A in the first quarter of 2020 related to two
reporting units contained within our International segment, including $83 million related to our ANJ reporting unit and $143 million related to our LATAM
reporting unit, which represented all of the goodwill associated with these reporting units. The remaining reporting units tested as part of our post-
reorganization impairment test each had excess fair value over carrying amount as of December 29, 2019.
We performed our 2020 annual impairment test as of March 29, 2020, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2020. We utilized the discounted
cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Through the performance of the 2020 annual impairment test,
we identified impairments related to our U.S. Foodservice, Canada Retail, Canada Foodservice, and EMEA East reporting units. As a result, we recognized
a non-cash impairment loss of $1.8 billion in SG&A in the second quarter of 2020, which included an $815 million impairment loss in our Canada Retail
reporting unit within our North America segment, a $655 million impairment loss in our U.S. Foodservice reporting unit within our North America
segment, a $205 million impairment loss in our Canada Foodservice reporting unit within our North America segment, and a $142 million impairment loss
in our EMEA East reporting unit within our International segment. These impairments were primarily due to the completion of our enterprise strategy and
five-year operating plan in the second quarter of 2020.
In the third quarter of 2020, following changes to our zone reporting structure, the composition of certain of our reporting units changed and we performed
an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis.
We performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of June 28, 2020, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2020. There were no impairment
losses resulting from this pre-reorganization impairment test.
We performed our post-reorganization impairment test as of June 28, 2020. There were three reporting units in scope for our post-reorganization
impairment test: ESA, KSB, and MFC. These reporting units, which were tested as part of this post-reorganization impairment test, each had excess fair
value over carrying amount as of June 28, 2020.
Additionally, in the third quarter of 2020, we announced the Cheese Transaction and determined that the Cheese Disposal Group was held for sale.
Accordingly, based on a relative fair value allocation, we reclassified $580 million of goodwill to assets held for sale, which included a portion of goodwill
from seven of our reporting units. Following the reclassification of a portion of goodwill from our reporting units, we determined that a triggering event
had occurred for the remaining portion of each of the impacted reporting units, and we tested each for impairment as of September 15, 2020, the triggering
event date. The triggering event impairment test did not result in an impairment of the remaining portion of any impacted reporting units.
In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $300 million in SG&A, which was related to the Cheese Disposal Group’s
goodwill. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information on the Cheese Transaction and its financial statement impacts.
68
Additional Goodwill Considerations
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating
the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and
regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and
other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing
expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as
discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change,
including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. Additionally, any
decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to goodwill impairments.
Our reporting units that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of
future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Although the remaining reporting units have more than 20%
excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and
the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values.
Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets:
Changes in the carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions):
Balance at December 26, 2020 $ 42,267 
Impairment losses (1,307)
Divestitures (1,487)
Translation adjustments and other (54)
Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 39,419 
Impairment losses (462)
Translation adjustments and other (405)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,552 
2022 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing
We performed our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of March 27, 2022, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2022. As a result of our Q2
2022 Annual Impairment Test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $395 million in SG&A in our North America segment in the second quarter of
2022 related to four brands, Maxwell House, Miracle Whip, Jet Puffed, and Classico. We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach
to estimate the fair values of the Maxwell House, Jet Puffed, and Classico brands and the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate
the fair value of the Miracle Whip brand. The impairments of the Maxwell House, Jet Puffed, and Classico brands were primarily due to downward
revisions in expected future operating margins as well as an increase in the discount rate, which was impacted by higher interest rates and other market
inputs. The impairment of the Miracle Whip brand was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate as well as downward revisions in expected future
operating margins due to changes in expectations for commodity input costs, including soybean oil. These brands had an aggregate carrying amount of
$3.2 billion prior to these impairments and $2.8 billion after these impairments.
We performed our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of June 26, 2022, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2022. As a result of our Q3 2022
Annual Impairment Test we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $67 million in SG&A in the third quarter of 2022 related to two brands, Jet Puffed
and Plasmon. We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recorded non-cash impairment losses of
$50 million in our North America segment and $17 million in our International segment, consistent with ownership of the trademarks. The impairment of
these brands was primarily due to reduced revenue growth assumptions. After the impairments, the aggregate carrying amount of these brands was
$204 million.
Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $38.6 billion
at December 31, 2022. As of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, brands with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying
amount after impairment of $16.6 billion, brands with between 20%-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of $2.5 billion,
and brands that had over 50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of $19.4 billion.
69
2021 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing
We performed our 2021 annual impairment test as of March 28, 2021, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2021. As a result of our 2021 annual
impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $69 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2021 related to two brands, Plasmon and
Maxwell House. We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recorded non-cash impairment losses
of $45 million in our International segment related to Plasmon and $24 million in our North America segment related to Maxwell House, consistent with
the ownership of the trademarks. The impairment of the Plasmon brand was largely due to downward revised revenue expectations for infant nutrition in
Italy. The impairment of the Maxwell House brand was primarily due to downward revised revenue expectations for mainstream coffee in the U.S.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, following the monetization of the licensed portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands in connection with the closing of the
Cheese Transaction, we performed an interim impairment test and utilized the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value
on these brands as of November 29, 2021, the Cheese Transaction Closing Date. While the Velveeta brand had a fair value in excess of its carrying amount,
the Kraft brand had a fair value below its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $1.2 billion in SG&A in the fourth
quarter of 2021 related to the Kraft brand. We recognized this impairment loss in our North America segment, consistent with the ownership of the Kraft
trademark.
2020 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing
We performed our 2020 annual impairment test as of March 29, 2020, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2020. As a result of our 2020 annual
impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $1.1 billion in SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 primarily related to nine brands (Oscar
Mayer, Maxwell House, Velveeta, Cool Whip, Plasmon, ABC, Classico, Wattie’s, and Planters), which included impairment losses of $956 million in our
North America segment and $100 million in our International segment, consistent with the ownership of the trademarks. We utilized the excess earnings
method and the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recognized a $626 million impairment loss related to
the Oscar Mayer brand, a $140 million impairment loss related to the Maxwell House brand, and a $290 million impairment loss primarily related to seven
other brands (Velveeta, Cool Whip, Plasmon, ABC, Classico, Wattie’s, and Planters).
Additional Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Considerations
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating
the fair value of individual brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory
conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates,
royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively
impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if
market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management’s
expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our brands might become impaired in the
future. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to intangible asset impairments.
Our brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable
impairment test dates. Accordingly, these and other individual brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022
Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Although the
remaining brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also
associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at
their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also
susceptible to impairments.

At December 25, 2021, definite-lived intangible assets excluded amounts classified as held for sale.
Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $261 million in 2022, $239 million in 2021, and $264 million in 2020. Aside from
amortization expense, the change in definite-lived intangible assets from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022 primarily reflects $315 million of
additions, which are largely related to the Hemmer Acquisition, the Just Spices Acquisition, and the Assan Foods Acquisition, the impact of foreign
currency, and $7 million of non-cash impairment losses related to two trademarks in our International segment. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures,
for additional information on these acquisitions. The impairment of definite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2022 relates to two trademarks
that had a net carrying value that was deemed not to be recoverable.
In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded $9 million of non-cash impairment losses to SG&A related to a trademark in our International segment that had
a net carrying value that was deemed not to be recoverable.
We estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $260 million in 2023 and $250 million in each of the
following four years.
Note 9. Income Taxes
Provision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes:
Income/(loss) before income taxes and the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, consisted of the following (in millions):

We record tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments within our tax provision. Accordingly, we recognized an
insignificant tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income in each of 2022, 2021, and 2020 related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options
and other equity instruments.

Effective Tax Rate:
The effective tax rate on income/(loss) before income taxes differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the following reasons:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
Tax on income of foreign subsidiaries (8.2)% (12.9)% (26.1)%
U.S. state and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.8 % (0.5)% 0.6 %
Audit settlements and changes in uncertain tax positions 1.3 % 0.4 % 3.7 %
Global intangible low-taxed income 1.8 % 5.5 % 6.5 %
Goodwill impairment 3.9 % 4.7 % 57.2 %
(Losses)/gains related to acquisitions and divestitures 0.3 % 12.9 % 0.1 %
Movement of valuation allowance reserves 0.8 % 0.1 % (0.4)%
Deferred tax effect of tax law changes (0.9)% 9.8 % (2.1)%
Deferred tax adjustments (1.1)% 0.3 % 2.8 %
Other (0.5)% (1.2)% 1.7 %
Effective tax rate 20.2 % 40.1 % 65.0 %
The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly,
the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation
of the percentage point impact of goodwill impairment and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss)
before income taxes. The percentage point impacts on the effective tax rates fluctuate due to income/(loss) before income taxes, which included goodwill
and intangible asset impairment losses in all years presented in the table. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world
could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods. Additionally, small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law or a change in tax
rates that causes us to revalue our deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate.
Our 2022 effective tax rate was an expense of 20.2% on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable geographic mix of pre-tax
income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain favorable items, primarily the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign
entities, the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws, and changes in estimates of certain 2021 U.S. income and deductions.
This impact was partially offset by the impact of certain unfavorable items, primarily non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on
global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), and the establishment of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance reserves.
Our 2021 effective tax rate was an expense of 40.1% on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items,
primarily the tax impacts related to acquisitions and divestitures, which mainly reflect the impacts of the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction,
partially offset by 2021 capital losses; the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international and state tax rates, mainly an increase in
U.K. tax rates; the impact of the federal tax on GILTI; and non-deductible goodwill impairments. These impacts were partially offset by a favorable
geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Our 2020 effective tax rate was an expense of 65.0% on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items,
primarily related to non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to
changes in international tax laws. These impacts were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S.
jurisdictions and the favorable impact of establishing certain deferred tax assets for state tax deductions.
See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information related to our impairment losses. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for
additional information on our acquisitions and divestitures.

Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities:
The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in
millions):
December 31, 2022December 25, 2021
Deferred income tax liabilities:
Intangible assets, net $ 9,985 $ 10,212 
Property, plant and equipment, net 680 748 
Right-of-use assets 131 110 
Other 408 455 
Deferred income tax liabilities 11,204 11,525 
Deferred income tax assets:
Other employee benefits (111) (119)
Deferred income (356) (369)
Lease liabilities (139) (115)
Other (693) (621)
Deferred income tax assets (1,299) (1,224)
Valuation allowance 96 101 
Net deferred income tax liabilities $ 10,001 $ 10,402 
The 2021 deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflected in the above table have been adjusted principally to reflect deferred taxes on the gross up of the
operating lease right-of-use assets and the operating lease liabilities under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update had the effect of increasing both
the total deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities by $210 million for the year ended December 25, 2021. These adjustments have
no net impact on the net deferred income tax liabilities or on the consolidated financial statements and we do not believe they are material to the annual
consolidated financial statements.
The decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by intangible asset impairment
losses in 2022. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information on the impairment losses.
At December 31, 2022, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $621 million. Of that amount, $47 million expire between 2023 and 2042; the other
$575 million do not expire. We have recorded $180 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
of $22 million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2023 and 2042. At December 31,
2022, tax credit carryforwards totaled $55 million, which included state tax credits of $22 million, foreign credits of $18 million, and U.S. foreign tax
credits of $15 million.
Uncertain Tax Positions:
At December 31, 2022, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $455 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact
on our effective tax rate would have been $425 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $3 million
in the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax
positions are included in income taxes payable and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were (in millions):
December 31, 2022December 25, 2021December 26, 2020
Balance at the beginning of the period $ 441 $ 421 $ 406 
Increases for tax positions of prior years 8 13 13 
Decreases for tax positions of prior years (27) (51) (34)
Increases based on tax positions related to the current year 53 75 57 
Decreases due to settlements with taxing authorities (6) (1) (8)
Decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations (14) (16) (13)
Balance at the end of the period $ 455 $ 441 $ 421 
73
Our unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2022 and 2021 mainly as a result of a net increase for tax positions related to the current and prior years in
the U.S. and certain state and foreign jurisdictions, which were partially offset by decreases related to audit settlements with federal, state, and foreign
taxing authorities and statute of limitations expirations.
We include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a
$20 million expense in 2022, a $9 million expense in 2021, and a $10 million expense in 2020 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and
penalties were $100 million as of December 31, 2022 and $81 million as of December 25, 2021.
Other Income Tax Matters:
Tax Examinations:
We are currently under examination for income taxes by the IRS for the years 2018 and 2019. We are continuing to respond to Information Document
Requests. We have received a draft economist report and expect to receive a Notice of Proposed Adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign
subsidiaries asserting that our U.S. taxable income should have been higher in 2018 and 2019, which would result in additional U.S. tax expense for 2018
and 2019 plus interest and potential penalties. We strongly disagree with the IRS’s suggested position, believe that our tax positions are properly supported,
and intend to vigorously contest the position taken by the IRS and pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. We continue to maintain our
operating model and believe our income tax reserves are appropriate for all open tax years and that final adjudication of this matter will not have a material
impact on our results of operations and cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain, and if we are required to pay the IRS
additional U.S. taxes, interest, and potential penalties, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Brazil,
Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we have substantially concluded all national income
tax matters through 2020 for the Netherlands, through 2017 for the United States, through 2014 for Italy, through 2013 for the United Kingdom and
Canada, and through 2013, with the exception of 2007 and 2008 which are under litigation, for Brazil. We have substantially concluded all U.S. state
income tax matters through 2007.
Cash Held by International Subsidiaries:
Our undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Related to
these undistributed historic earnings, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $90 million of historic
earnings at December 31, 2022 and a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $135 million of historic earnings at
December 25, 2021. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed.
Subsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be
indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international
operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed, if repatriated, related to our 2018 through 2022 accumulated
earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately $50 million.
Divestitures:
Related to the Cheese Transaction, we paid cash taxes of approximately $620 million in the second quarter of 2022.
Related to the Nuts Transaction, we paid cash taxes of approximately $700 million in the second half of 2021.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. We are currently evaluating the law and do not expect the
Inflation Reduction Act to have a significant impact on our financial statements, including our annual estimated effective tax rate.
Note 10. Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans
We grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”), to select employees to provide
long-term performance incentives to our employees.
74
Stock Plans
We had activity related to equity awards from the following plans in 2022, 2021, and 2020:
2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In May 2020, our stockholders approved The Kraft Heinz Company 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2020 Omnibus Plan”), which was adopted by our
Board of Directors (“Board”) in March 2020. The 2020 Omnibus Plan became effective March 2, 2020 (the “Plan Effective Date”) and will expire on the
tenth anniversary of the Plan Effective Date. The 2020 Omnibus Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 36 million shares of our common stock for awards to
employees, non-employee directors, and other key personnel. The 2020 Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. Equity awards granted under the 2020 Omnibus Plan
include awards that vest in full at the end of a three-year period as well as awards that vest in annual installments over three or four years beginning on the
second anniversary of the original grant date. Non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years from the date of the grant. As of the
Plan Effective Date, awards will no longer be granted under The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the H. J. Heinz Holding Corporation
2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, or any other equity plans other than the 2020 Omnibus Plan.
2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In April 2016, our stockholders approved The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2016 Omnibus Plan”), which was adopted by our
Board in February 2016. The 2016 Omnibus Plan authorized grants of up to 18 million shares of our common stock pursuant to options, stock appreciation
rights, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. Equity awards granted under the
2016 Omnibus Plan prior to 2019 generally vest in full at the end of a five-year period. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan in 2019
include awards that vest in full at the end of three and five-year periods as well as awards that become exercisable in annual installments over three to four
years beginning on the second anniversary of the original grant date. Non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. Equity
awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan since inception include non-qualified stock options, RSUs, and PSUs.
2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
Prior to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Plan, we issued non-qualified stock options to select employees under the H. J. Heinz Holding Corporation 2013
Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2013 Omnibus Plan”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a
Kraft Heinz stock option. Following this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock.
Non-qualified stock options awarded under the 2013 Omnibus Plan vest in full at the end of a five-year period and have a maximum exercise term of 10
years. These non-qualified stock options have vested and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2013 Omnibus Plan and
the relevant award agreements.
Kraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan:
Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 2012 Performance
Incentive Plan (“2012 Performance Incentive Plan”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to
purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option adjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft
Heinz RSU. These options generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have
a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These RSUs generally vest in full on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of
the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, vesting generally accelerated for holders of Kraft awards who were terminated without cause within 2 years of the
2015 Merger Date. These Kraft Heinz equity awards have vested and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable
immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger.
In addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance-based, long-term incentive awards (“Kraft Performance Shares”), which vested based on
varying performance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Kraft Performance Shares were converted into
cash awards, payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Kraft Performance Share cycle completed prior to the
2015 Merger and (ii) the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's
termination without cause.

Stock Options
We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. Our weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
Risk-free interest rate 1.64 % 1.03 % 0.45 %
Expected term 6.5 years 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected volatility 28.5 % 32.1 % 33.6 %
Expected dividend yield 4.4 % 4.6 % 5.7 %
Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 6.46 $ 6.63 $ 4.77 
The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date, with a remaining term equal to the expected term
of the options. The expected term is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data, we
calculated expected term using the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. We estimated volatility using a blended
volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. We estimated the expected
dividend yield using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded.
Our stock option activity and related information was:

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the period was $24 million in 2022, $23 million in 2021, and $24 million in 2020.
Cash received from options exercised was $57 million in 2022, $53 million in 2021, and $85 million in 2020. The tax benefit realized from stock options
exercised was $8 million in 2022, $12 million in 2021, and $16 million in 2020.

Restricted Stock Units
RSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable plan and award agreement.
We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs are not dividend eligible. We discounted the fair value
of these RSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price,
annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs granted during the year was $37.50 in 2022, $36.36 in 2021, and $29.27 in 2020. All
RSUs granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were dividend eligible.

The aggregate fair value of RSUs that vested during the period was $163 million in 2022, $135 million in 2021, and $6 million in 2020.
Performance Share Units
PSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable plan and award agreement
and are subject to achievement or satisfaction of performance or market conditions specified by the Compensation Committee of our Board.
For our PSUs that are tied to performance conditions, we used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value. The PSUs are not dividend
eligible; therefore, we discounted the fair value of the PSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided
by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of PSUs is amortized to expense on a straight-
line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards. We adjust the expense based on the likelihood of future
achievement of performance metrics.
For our PSUs that are tied to market-based conditions, the grant date fair value was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation model, which takes into
account expected volatility and dividend yield, among other things. The related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market
condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. The final award is based on the achievement of market-based components and
service-based vesting conditions and may equal 0% to 150% of the target grant amount, based on achievement of the market-based conditions.
In 2019, we granted PSUs to our Chief Executive Officer that were tied to market-based conditions. The vesting date for these awards occurred without the
performance conditions having been met and the PSUs were forfeited.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our PSUs granted during the year was $34.45 in 2022, $35.03 in 2021, and $28.50 in 2020. Our
expected dividend yield was 4.41% in 2022, 4.63% in 2021, and 5.10% in 2020. For our PSUs that are tied to market-based conditions, our expected
volatility was 32.92% in 2022 and 38.90% in 2021.

Note 11. Postemployment Benefits
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic
union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance
with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized,
non-union hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations.
We provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and
Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement
benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment.
We remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and $3.8 billion at
December 25, 2021 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022
and $2.1 billion at December 25, 2021.
The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in net pension assets of $843 million at December 31, 2022 and $1.3 billion at December 25, 2021.

we recognized special/contractual termination benefits for our U.S plans related to the Nuts Transaction, including a loss of $3 million. These
special/contractual termination benefits are recorded in other expense/(income) as a component of our pre-tax loss/(gain) on sale of business on the
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 25, 2021.
We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net pension costs for the years ended:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
December 31, 2022December 25, 2021December 26, 2020December 31, 2022December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
Discount rate - Service cost 4.0 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 2.4 % 2.1 % 2.5 %
Discount rate - Interest cost 4.0 % 2.3 % 2.8 % 1.8 % 1.2 % 1.8 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.3 % 4.2 % 4.4 % 2.6 % 3.1 % 3.8 %
Rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.1 % 3.8 % 3.5 % 3.7 %
Discount rates for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that
match the expected future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' historical long-term
investment performance, target asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.
Plan Assets:
The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit
obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the
security of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and
requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return
over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit
payment cash flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation
guidelines, criteria for the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager
performance. It also provides guidelines enabling the applicable plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.

Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %
Our pension investment strategy for U.S. plans is designed to align our pension assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility. We target
an investment of approximately 75% of our U.S. plan assets in fixed-income securities, approximately 15% in alternatives, primarily real assets and
diversified credit, and approximately 10% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities. Prior to 2022, we targeted an investment of approximately
85% of our U.S. plan assets in fixed-income securities and approximately 15% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities.
For pension plans outside the United States, our investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each
individual country. In aggregate, the long-term asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately
83% fixed-income securities and certain insurance contracts, approximately 8% in alternatives, primarily multi-asset credit, and approximately 9% in
return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in
the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.
Government Bonds. These securities consist of direct investments in publicly traded U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally debentures). Such
investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are included in Level 1.
Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally
corporate bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other
observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2. Any securities that are in default are included in Level 3.
Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the
closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1. Beginning
in 2022, all equity exposure is provided through pooled funds valued at net asset value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based
on cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified
as Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2.
Real Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments and are generally classified as Level 3.
Certain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members and have
been classified as Level 3.
Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments, and partnership/corporate feeder interests.
•Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the
collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The
fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be
redeemed daily, monthly, or quarterly based upon the applicable net asset value per unit and the terms of the specific trust agreements.
The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange, and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income
manager. The fair values of these investments are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of
actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset
value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable risk, where performance is
expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the investment manager.(a)
    
82
•Short-term investments. Short-term investments largely consist of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported
by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at
net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a
competitive yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest
possible level of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.
•Partnership/corporate feeder interests. Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of
the partnership. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the equity
partnership may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner.
The investment objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities.
The fair values of the corporate feeder are based upon the net asset values of the equity master fund in which it invests. The fair value of these
investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with
at least 90 days’ notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities
with attractive fundamentals.

Employer Contributions:
In 2022, we contributed $11 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We did not contribute to our U.S. pension plans. We estimate that 2023 pension
contributions will be approximately $11 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We do not plan to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2023.
Estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions, which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected
contributions for 2023. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and
regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.

We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021
Discount rate 5.5 % 2.8 %
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.6 % 5.9 %
Ultimate trend rate 4.8 % 4.8 %
Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going
forward.
The year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2023 and 2030 as of December 31, 2022.
Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans.(a)

Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) (15) (16) (14)
Curtailments — (4) — 
Net postretirement cost/(benefit) $ (53)$ (51)$ (146)
We present all non-service cost components of net postretirement cost/(benefit) within other expense/(income) on our consolidated statements of income. In
2021, we recognized a curtailment gain of $4 million related to the Nuts Transaction. This gain is recorded in other expense/(income) as a component of
our pre-tax loss/(gain) on sale of business on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 25, 2021.
The amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by plan amendments in 2015 and 2016. We estimate that amortization of prior service credits
will be insignificant in each of the next five years.
We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net postretirement benefit plans cost for the years ended:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020
Discount rate - Service cost 2.8 % 2.7 % 3.3 %
Discount rate - Interest cost 3.4 % 1.6 % 2.7 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.4 % 4.4 % 4.7 %
Health care cost trend rate 6.6 % 5.9 % 6.2 %
Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' target asset allocation and estimates of future
long-term returns by asset class. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates
going forward.

Our postretirement benefit plan investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our
investment strategy is designed to align our postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate,
our long-term asset allocation targets are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 70% in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-
seeking assets, primarily equity securities.

(b)    At December 25, 2021, the fair value of our derivative assets was recorded in other current assets ($74 million) and other non-current assets ($173 million), and the fair value of our
derivative liabilities was recorded in other current liabilities ($42 million) and other non-current liabilities ($170 million).
(c)    At December 25, 2021, the fair value of our derivative assets was recorded in other current assets and the fair value of derivative liabilities was recorded in other current liabilities.
Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or
early termination of the contract. We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated balance
sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been netted on the consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been
reduced by $222 million at December 31, 2022 and $155 million at December 25, 2021. At December 31, 2022 we had posted collateral of $43 million
related to commodity derivative margin requirements, which was included in prepaid expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 25, 2021,
we had collected collateral related to commodity derivative margin requirements of $12 million, which was included in other current liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheet.
Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities.
Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity swaps, foreign exchange forwards, options, and swaps, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity
swaps are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional
amount. Foreign exchange forwards and swaps are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate
multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign exchange options are valued using an income approach based on a Black-Scholes-Merton formula. This
formula uses present value techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on observable market rates. Cross-currency swaps are valued
based on observable market spot and swap rates.
We did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities in any period presented.
Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.
Net Investment Hedging:
At December 31, 2022, we had the following items designated as net investment hedges:
•Non-derivative foreign denominated debt with principal amounts of €650 million and £400 million; and
•Cross-currency contracts with notional amounts of C$1.4 billion ($1.0 billion), €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion), JPY9.6 billion ($67 million), and
CNH500 million ($68 million).
We periodically use non-derivative instruments such as non-U.S. dollar financing transactions or non-U.S. dollar assets or liabilities, including
intercompany loans, to hedge the exposure of changes in underlying foreign currency denominated subsidiary net assets, and they are designated as net
investment hedges. At December 31, 2022, our intercompany loans designated as net investment hedges were insignificant.(a)
(b)
(c)
(a)
89
The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are
economically offset by fair value movements on the effective portion of our cross-currency contracts and foreign exchange contracts and remeasurements
of our foreign denominated debt.
Interest Rate Hedging:
From time to time we have had derivatives designated as interest rate hedges, including interest rate swaps. We no longer have any outstanding interest rate
swaps. We continue to amortize the realized hedge losses that were deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) into interest expense
through the original maturity of the related long-term debt instruments.
Cash Flow Hedge Coverage:
At December 31, 2022, we had entered into foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next two years and
into cross-currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next six years.
Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses on Cash Flow Hedges:
Based on our valuation at December 31, 2022 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net
income/(loss) of unrealized gains during the next 12 months on foreign currency cash flow hedges to be approximately $26 million and on cross-currency
cash flow hedges to be insignificant. Additionally, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized losses on interest rate cash flow hedges during the
next 12 months to be insignificant.
Concentration of Credit Risk:
Counterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit
ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses
due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our
counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses.
Economic Hedging:
We enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy, which have an economic
impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of
cost of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income) for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts.
Acquisition Hedging:
We entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the cash consideration for the
Hemmer Acquisition. These derivative contracts settled in our second quarter of 2022. The related derivative gains were $38 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, and were recorded within other expense/(income). These gains are classified as other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and
divestitures. The related cash flows were classified as cash inflows from investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 4,
Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to the Hemmer Acquisition.

income/(loss).

Note 14. Financing Arrangements
We enter into various product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the
arrangements. We have concluded that our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are impacted by their
participation in the program and therefore we classify amounts outstanding within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We had
approximately $87 million at December 31, 2022 and approximately $215 million at December 25, 2021 on our consolidated balance sheets related to these
arrangements.(a)

Transfers of Financial Assets:
Since 2020, we have had a nonrecourse accounts receivable factoring program whereby certain eligible receivables are sold to third party financial
institutions in exchange for cash. The program provides us with an additional means for managing liquidity. Under the terms of the arrangement, we act as
the collecting agent on behalf of the financial institutions to collect amounts due from customers for the receivables sold. We account for the transfer of
receivables as a true sale at the point control is transferred through derecognition of the receivable on our consolidated balance sheet. Receivables sold
under this accounts receivable factoring program were approximately $197 million during 2022, with an insignificant amount outstanding as of
December 31, 2022. The incremental costs of factoring receivables under this arrangement were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2022. No
receivables were sold under this accounts receivable factoring program during 2021, and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 25, 2021. The
proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections, or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of
our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we
do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.
Class Actions and Stockholder Derivative Actions:
The Kraft Heinz Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in a consolidated securities class action
lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Union Asset Management Holding AG, et al. v. The Kraft Heinz
Company, et al. The consolidated amended class action complaint, which was filed on August 14, 2020 and also names 3G Capital, Inc. and several of its
subsidiaries and affiliates (the “3G Entities”) as defendants, asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in
public statements, press releases, investor presentations, earnings calls, Company documents, and SEC filings regarding the Company’s business, financial
results, and internal controls, and further alleges the 3G Entities engaged in insider trading and misappropriated the Company’s material, non-public
information. In February 2023, the parties to the litigation reached a preliminary settlement agreement. Based upon our current estimate for the ultimate
resolution of this matter, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a net expense of $210 million within SG&A in our consolidated statements of income.
This expense contemplates the Company’s estimated liability after insurance recoveries and contributions from other defendants. The Company’s estimated
liability and the insurance recoveries are reflected in current liabilities and current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. While it
is possible that the ultimate amount of our liability in connection with this settlement could be different than the amount accrued, we believe that any
difference between that ultimate liability and the amount already accrued will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows. Any eventual final settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Certain of The Kraft Heinz Company’s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities are also named as defendants in a stockholder
derivative action, In re Kraft Heinz Shareholder Derivative Litigation, which had been previously consolidated in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, and is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The court appointed lead
plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel on October 21, 2021, and lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 22, 2021. The consolidated
amended complaint asserts state law claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, as well as federal claims for contribution for
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or
misleading statements and omissions in public statements and SEC filings, and for implementing cost cutting measures that allegedly damaged the
Company. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys’ fees, and other relief.
96
Certain of The Kraft Heinz Company’s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities were also named as defendants in a consolidated
stockholder derivative action, In re Kraft Heinz Company Derivative Litigation, which was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The consolidated
amended complaint, which was filed on April 27, 2020, alleged state law claims, contending that the 3G Entities were controlling stockholders who owed
fiduciary duties to the Company, and that they breached those duties by allegedly engaging in insider trading and misappropriating the Company’s material,
non-public information. The complaint further alleged that certain of The Kraft Heinz Company’s current and former officers and directors breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company by purportedly making materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the Company’s financial performance
and the impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and by supposedly approving or allowing the 3G Entities’ alleged insider trading. The complaint
sought relief against the defendants in the form of damages, disgorgement of all profits obtained from the alleged insider trading, contribution and
indemnification, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint, which motion
the Delaware Chancery Court granted in an order dated December 15, 2021. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on January 13, 2022, and the Delaware
Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated amended complaint in an order dated August 1, 2022.
Certain of The Kraft Heinz Company’s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities are named as defendants in an additional stockholder
derivative action, Datnoff, et al. v. Behring, et al., which was filed on May 6, 2022 in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges state law
claims and contends that the Company’s Board of Directors wrongfully refused plaintiffs’ demands to pursue legal action against the named defendants.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company
by purportedly making materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the Company’s financial performance and the impairment of its goodwill
and intangible assets. The complaint further alleges that the 3G Entities and certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors breached
their fiduciary duties by engaging in insider trading and misappropriating the Company’s material, non-public information, or aided and abetted such
alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint seeks relief against the defendants, principally in the form of damages, disgorgement of all profits
obtained from the alleged insider trading, contribution and indemnification, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.
We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, due to the early stage of
these proceedings.
2021 United States Government Settlement:
On September 3, 2021, The Kraft Heinz Company reached a settlement with the SEC, concluding and resolving in its entirety the previously disclosed SEC
investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we, without admitting or denying the findings in the administrative order issued by the SEC, agreed to pay
a civil penalty of $62 million and to cease and desist from violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder.
We recognized the full amount of the penalty in the second quarter of 2021 in SG&A, and paid the penalty in the third quarter of 2021.
Other Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations:
We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected
needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures,
information technology, and professional services.
As of December 31, 2022, our take-or-pay purchase obligations were as follows (in millions):

Note 16. Debt
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, tender offers, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancing,
exchange offers, open market or privately negotiated transactions, Rule 10b5-1 plans, or otherwise. Cash payments related to debt extinguishment are
classified as cash outflows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt are
recognized in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.
97
Borrowing Arrangements:
In July 2022, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company (“KHFC”), our 100% owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a new credit agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”), which provides for a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion (the “Senior Credit
Facility”) that will mature on July 8, 2027 and replaced our then-existing credit facility (the “Previous Senior Credit Facility”). See Note 17, Debt, to our
consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information on the Previous
Senior Credit Facility.
The Credit Agreement includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for borrowings in Canadian dollars, euro, or British pound sterling, as well as a swingline sub-
facility of up to $400 million, and a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $300 million. Additionally, and subject to certain conditions, we may increase the
amount of revolving commitments and/or add tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of borrowing and
certain other customary conditions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could, upon the
occurrence of certain events of default, restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum
shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $35 billion.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by KHFC and The Kraft Heinz Company in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any
subsidiary borrower.
In the first quarter of 2020, as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global economy resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $4.0 billion under our Previous Senior Credit Facility. We repaid the full $4.0 billion during the second quarter of
2020. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2022, on our Previous Senior Credit Facility at December 25, 2021, or on
either the Senior Credit Facility or Previous Senior Credit Facility during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.

inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Note 17. Leases
We have operating and finance leases, primarily for warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment. Our lease contracts have remaining
contractual lease terms of up to 19 years, some of which include options to extend the term by up to 10 years. We include renewal options that are
reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Additionally, some lease contracts include termination options. We do not expect to exercise the
majority of our termination options and generally exclude such options when determining the term of our leases. See Note 2, Significant Accounting
Policies, for our lease accounting policy.

Our variable lease costs primarily consist of inventory related costs, such as materials, labor, and overhead components in our manufacturing and
distribution arrangements that also contain a fixed component related to an embedded lease. These variable lease costs are determined based on usage or
output or may vary for other reasons such as changes in material prices, taxes, or insurance. Certain of our variable lease costs are based on fluctuating
indices or rates. These leases are included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date. The future
variability in these indices and rates is unknown; therefore, it is excluded from our future minimum lease payments and is not a component of our ROU
assets or lease liabilities.
Losses/(gains) on sales and leaseback transactions, net, were insignificant for 2022 and 2021. We had no losses/(gains) on sale and leaseback transactions

Note 20. Segment Reporting
In the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North
America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by
streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable
segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and
depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-
related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized
gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and
losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity
award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in
comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying
operations. Management also uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to allocate resources.
Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.

(a)    Excludes amortization of prior service costs/(credits).
(b)    Includes a gain on the remeasurement of a disposal group that was reclassified as held and used in the third quarter of 2021.
We present all non-service cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement cost/(benefit) within other expense/(income) on our
consolidated statements of income. See Note 11, Postemployment Benefits, for additional information on these components, including any curtailments and
settlements, as well as information on our prior service credit amortization. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to
our loss/(gain) on sale of business. See Note 12, Financial Instruments, for information related to our derivative impacts.
Other expense/(income) was $253 million of income in 2022 compared to $295 million of income in 2021. This change was primarily driven by a
$79 million decrease in net pension and postretirement non-service benefits and a $25 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2022 compared to a $44
million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021. These impacts were partially offset by a $50 million net loss on derivative activities in 2022 compared to an
$86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 and a $12 million increase in interest income as compared to the prior year period.(a)
(b)
107
Other expense/(income) was $295 million of income in 2021 compared to $296 million of income in 2020. This change was primarily driven by an $86
million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 compared to a $154 million net gain on derivative activities in 2020 and a $115 million decrease in non-
cash amortization of postemployment benefit plans prior service credits as compared to the prior year period. These impacts were partially offset by a $101
million net foreign exchange gain in 2021 compared to a $162 million net foreign exchange loss in 2020, a $44 million net gain on sales of businesses in
2021 compared to a $2 million net loss on sales of businesses in 2020, and a $26 million loss on the dissolution of a joint venture in 2020.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2022, were effective and
provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;
•provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework described in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report

be included as a period of Service for purposes of the Plan.
5.3    Benefits under this Plan are not intended to be in addition to pay-in-lieu-of-notice or similar termination benefits

severance arrangement which may be of fered from time to time shall be set forth in an appendix to this Plan and shall be in lieu
of, and not in addition to, benefits otherwise payable under this Plan.
5.6    A Participant who is re-employed by an Employer or an Af filiate shall repay that portion of the severance pay
attributable to the period after the Participant became re-employed.
5.7    Employees who are away from work due to an approved disability leave, military leave  or family medical leave of
absence, at the time that the Employee would otherwise qualify for severance pay under the Plan, will be paid severance pay if
they qualify under Section 4 and are timely released to return to work, determined as follows:
(a)    for a disability or unpaid medical leave, a timely release to return to work will occur if the Employee is
released to return to work within 12 months from the Employee’ s initial date of leave-related absence, medical
documentation of such release is timely provided to the Employer , and the release is certified by the Company’ s disability
benefit administrator;
(b)    for a military leave of absence, a timely release to return to work will occur if an Employee makes a request
to return to work within the time required under applicable federal law; and
10

schedule leave at time of severance triggering event.

6.1(a), the remaining unvested portion of any equity award granted under the Company’ s equity incentive plans that is
outstanding as of the Participant’ s date of termination shall remain outstanding to the extent necessary (but subject in all
cases to their maximum term) to enable their potential future vesting and exercisability in the event of a CIC Qualifying
Termination.

8.7    Each of the Company and the Compensation Committee fully expect to continue the Plan, but each of the Company
and the Compensation Committee, acting separately , reserve the right to change or end the Plan at any time for any reason. Any

claim, the Administrator shall, within 90 days after the claim is filed, notify the claimant in writing of the extension, of the
reasons for the extension and the date a final decision can be expected. In no event shall the extension exceed a period of 90 days
from the end of the initial 90-day period.
13
9.3    Any Employee, or a duly authorized representative thereof, who is denied severance pay in whole or in part,
pursuant to Section 9.2 above, may appeal from such denial to the Administrator for a review of the decision by submitting to the
Administrator , within 60 days after receiving a notice of denial, a written statement:
(a)    requesting a review of the claim for severance pay by the Administrator;
(b)    setting forth all of the grounds upon which the appeal is based and any facts in support thereof; and

SECTION 10.     GOVERNING LA W
To the extent that State law shall not have been preempted by ERISA or any other laws of the United States or
other non-U.S. jurisdiction heretofore or hereafter enacted, as the same may be amended from time to time, this Plan shall be
administered, construed and enforced according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
SECTION 1 1.     COORDINA TION WITH CODE SECTION 409A
This Plan shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under Section 409A of the Code. If any payment or
benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under Section 409A of the Code, then
such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions shall not be imposed. For
14
purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each payment made under this Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. In no event
may the Participant, directly or indirectly , designate the calendar year of payment. To the maximum extent permitted under
Section 409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations, the cash severance benefits payable under this Plan are intended to
meet the requirements of the short-term deferral exemption under Section 409A of the Code and the “separation pay exception”
under T reas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). However , if such severance benefits do not qualify for such exemptions at the time of the
Participant’ s termination of employment and therefore are deemed as deferred compensation subject to the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code, then if the Participant is a “specified employee” under Section 409A of the Code on the date of the
Participant’ s termination of employment, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, payment of severance under this Plan
shall be delayed for a period of six months from the date of the Participant’ s termination of employment if required by Section
409A of the Code. The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump-sum payment within 15 days after the end of the
six-month period. If the Participant dies during the postponement period prior to payment of the postponed amount, the amounts
withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate within 15 days after the date of the
Participant’ s death. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Plan shall be made or provided in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall
be for expenses incurred during the Participant’ s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Plan), (ii) the
amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not af fect the expenses
eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year , (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible
expense shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv)
the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 1 1 shall not apply to any Participant who is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. Neither
the Company nor its Af filiates or their directors, of ficers, employees or advisers shall be liable to the Participant (or any other
individual claiming a benefit through the Participant) for any tax, interest or penalties the Participant may owe as a result of
compensation or benefits paid under this Plan, and the Company and its Af filiates shall have no obligation to indemnify or
otherwise protect the Participant from the obligation to pay any taxes pursuant to Section 409A or otherwise.
SECTION 12.     CODE SECTION 280G
12.1    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any compensation or benefit program or other agreement to the
contrary , if any payment or benefit by or from the Company or any of its Af filiates to or for the benefit of the Participant, whether
paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, would be subject to the Excise T ax
(as hereinafter defined) (all such payments and benefits being collectively referred to herein as the “ Payments ”), then except as
otherwise provided in Section 12.2, the Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) or eliminated (as further provided for in
Section 12.3) to the extent the Independent T ax Advisor shall reasonably determine is necessary so that no portion of the
Payments shall be subject to the Excise T ax (the “ Reduced Amount ”).
15
12.2    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, if the Independent T ax Advisor reasonably determines that the
Participant would receive, in the aggregate, a greater amount of the Payments on an after -tax basis (including all applicable
federal, state and local income, employment and other applicable taxes and the Excise T ax) if the Payments were not reduced or
eliminated to the Reduced Amount pursuant to Section 12.1, then no such reduction shall be made notwithstanding that all or any
portion of the Payments may be subject to the Excise T ax.
12.3    For purposes of determining which of Section 12.1 and Section 12.2 shall be given ef fect, the determination of
which Payments shall be reduced or eliminated to avoid the Excise T ax shall be made by the Independent T ax Advisor . The

Company’s Common Stock set forth below, at the Exercise Price per share set forth below (the “Exercise Price”) on the following terms and
subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
Exhibit 10.35
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT
Vesting
This Option will vest and become exercisable on the “Vesting Date” set forth in this Award Agreement subject to your continued
Service (including, for the avoidance of doubt, service as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, consultant or advisor) with the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Any portion of this Option that becomes exercisable in accordance with the foregoing will
remain exercisable until the Expiration Date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without
limitation, the section below entitled “Termination”).
Exercisability
Subject to the section below entitled “Termination,” this Option may be exercised only while you are employed by or providing
Service to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Prior to the exercise of this Option, you will not have any rights of a
shareholder with respect to this Option or the Shares subject thereto.
This Option will be exercisable pursuant to procedures approved by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (formerly the
Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) and communicated to you. No Shares will be delivered pursuant to
the exercise of this Option unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the exercise of
this Option and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law and (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of the
aggregate exercise price of the Option and any Tax-Related Items (as defined below) have been received by the Company. Until such time as
the Shares are delivered to you, you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such
Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of this Option.
Unless otherwise determined by the Company or Committee, this Option may only be exercised on a day on which the Nasdaq
exchange (the “Exchange”) is open. Accordingly, if the Expiration Date is a day on which the Exchange is closed, the Expiration Date shall
be the immediately preceding day on which the Exchange is open.
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting and Exercisability
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit this Option
without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without Cause (as
defined below), the vesting of your Option shall accelerate upon such termination of Service as if 33.33% of the Shares subject to the Option
had vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date on which you provided Service. If prior to the Vesting Date your Service terminates
by reason of your death or Disability (as defined below), your Option shall become fully vested and exercisable upon such termination of
Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your Retirement
(as defined below), your Option shall become fully vested and exercisable upon such termination of Service. Following your termination of
Exhibit 10.35
Service, you (or, if applicable, such other person who is entitled to exercise this Option) may exercise such portion of the Option that is or
becomes vested upon your termination of Service during the period set forth in the table below.
To the extent this Option is or becomes exercisable on the date of termination of your Service, then, if you (or, if applicable, such
other person who is entitled to exercise this Option) do not exercise this Option on or prior to the expiration of the Option Exercise Period (as
set forth below), this Option will terminate; provided that in no event may you exercise this Option after the Expiration Date.
Type of Termination Option Exercise Period
Without Cause Three-year period beginning on the date of termination
Resignation* 90 days beginning on the date of termination
Retirement Three-year period beginning on the date of termination
Disability Three-year period beginning on the date of termination
Death Three-year period beginning on the date of termination
For Cause 30 days beginning on the date of termination
*except for a resignation that falls within the definition of “Without Cause.”
For purposes of the Option, your Service will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively providing Service to
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with no anticipated return to active service (regardless of the reason for such termination
and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of
your Employment Agreement or other service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or
determined by the Company, (i) your right to vest in the Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended
by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar
period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any);
and (ii) the period (if any) during which you may exercise the Option after such termination of your employment or Service relationship will
commence as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any. The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when
you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of this Option (including whether you may still be considered to be providing
Service while on a leave of absence).
Applicable Definitions
All capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement without definition shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. For purposes of
this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
“Disability” means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
“disability” (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
Exhibit 10.35
“Employment Agreement” means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including an offer letter.
“Retirement” means a termination of Service by you on or after either (a) the later of (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your completion
of five years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates; or (b) the later of (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your completion
of ten years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
“Without Cause” means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines “Good
Reason”, then “Without Cause” shall also include resignation of your Service for “Good Reason” in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service
on this Option and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election
of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date
the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied
(including your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the Options upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan. In the event that there is a conflict between the
terms of the Plan regarding the effect of a Change in Control on this Option and the terms of this Award Agreement or any Employment
Agreement, the terms of the Plan will govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As
such, in partial consideration of the Option granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company’s Restrictive
Covenants Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the
Restrictive Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Exhibit 10.35
Taxes
Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax, social
security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), you
acknowledge the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
any aspect of the Option grant or the Underlying Shares, including but not limited to the grant, vesting or exercise of this Option, the
subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of
the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to exercise of this Option, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation payable to you or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the
Company may in its sole and absolute discretion sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related
Items. Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its Subsidiaries
may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan or your purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your
obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or
other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may
receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent or if not refunded, you may seek a
refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly
to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in
Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding that
a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in
the Plan.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of this Option on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above
titled “Termination”) is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You
further acknowledge and agree this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed
as giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate. The
receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company’s Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a
Exhibit 10.35
determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section 409A of the
Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made by the
Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting this Option, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
(b) the Option award is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future Option awards, or benefits in lieu of Options even if Options have been awarded in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e) this Option is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates;
(f) this Option, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected
compensation or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses,
holiday pay, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
(g) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h) if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, this Option will have no value;
(i) if you receive Shares, the value of such Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise
Price per Share;
(j) unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Options, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value
of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;
(k) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages, including pro-rated compensation or damages, shall arise from forfeiture of
the Option resulting from termination of your Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of
the grant of the Option to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by
participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all
documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and
Exhibit 10.35
(l) this Option is subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments,
Repurchases and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting this Option, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with this Option. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
(a) Data Collection and Usage. The Company collects, processes and uses personal data about you, including but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, employee identification number,
hire date, termination date, gross earnings, tax rate, account identification number for the independent stock plan service provider
account, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to shares or equivalent
benefits awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, which the Company receives from you or the
Employer (“Data”) for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. The Company will only use your personal
data where expressly permitted by law. Generally, the Company will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•When needed to execute a contract that the Company is going to formalize or that the Company has formalized with you.
•Where necessary for the Company’s legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that the fundamental interests or
rights that assist you do not prevail over our interests or those of that third party.
•When the Company needs it to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation.
(b) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company may transfer Data to one or more independent stock plan service
providers, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Such service provider(s)
may open an account for you or ask you to receive and trade shares of common stock. You may be asked to acknowledge, or agree to,
separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider(s) with such agreement being a condition of participation in the
Plan. Please review these terms and data processing practices carefully. If you do not agree to the independent stock plan service
provider’s terms and/or data processing practices, you will not be able to participate in the Plan.
(c) International Data Transfers. Please note that Data processed in connection with the Plan will be transferred from your
country to the United States, where the Company and its service providers are based. Your country or jurisdiction may have different data
privacy laws and protections than the United States. The Company will ensure that appropriate measures are in place for compliance with
applicable data protection laws in relation to transfer of Data to the United States.
(d) Data Retention. The Company has a legal duty to keep various records and records need to be held for different periods of
time, depending on their contents. The Company will use your personal data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and
manage your participation in the Plan and as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and securities
laws. The
Exhibit 10.35
Company will therefore keep your personal data for as long as needed in connection with those obligations. The Company will not keep
your personal data for longer than data protection law allows.
(e) Data Subject Rights. You understand that you may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
Depending on where you are based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access or copies of personal data processed by the
Company, (ii) rectification of incorrect data, (iii) deletion of personal data, (iv) restrictions on processing of personal data, (v) portability
of personal data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent data protection authorities in your jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the
names and addresses of any potential recipients of your personal data. To receive clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these
rights, you can contact the Company’s Data Privacy Team at gdpr@kraftheinz.com.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries
This Option shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death, and this Option shall be
exercised during your lifetime only by you or your guardian or legal representative, except that this Option may be Transferred to one or
more Beneficiaries or other Transferees during your lifetime with the consent of the Committee, and may be exercised by such Transferees in
accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement. A Beneficiary, Transferee, or other person claiming any rights under this Award
Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, except as otherwise determined by the
Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of
any rights in respect of this Option shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written
notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer
and (ii) the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions applicable to this Option and any Shares
purchased upon exercise of this Option that are or would have been applicable to you.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the Options and without prejudice to the terms of the Company’s Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the Options and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject
to forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company (i) under the terms of the Company’s Clawback Policy, as may be amended from time to time
(and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your additional consent) or (ii) to comply with any
requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on
which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Section 10D of the Act and Rule 10D-1 thereunder. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what
you should have received under the terms of the Options for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement,
mistake in calculations or administrative error), all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such
excess amount to the Company.
Exhibit 10.35
Section 409A
It is intended that the Option awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the
Code (“Section 409A”) and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted construed and operated in a manner consistent with this intention. In
the event that the Company believes, at any time, that any benefit or right under this Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A, then the
Committee may (acting alone and without any required consent by you) amend this Award Agreement in such manner as the Committee
deems necessary or appropriate to be exempt from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A (including without limitation,
amending the Award Agreement to increase the Exercise Price per Share to such amount as may be required in order for the Option to be
exempt from Section 409A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the Option
awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or
other party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that
any provision of this Award Agreement, or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed
to violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute
the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings,
representations and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the
Plan, except with your consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.
Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan,
including this Award Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system
established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic
means with electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Exhibit 10.35
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render
it valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the
validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award Agreement, and the
remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent and
purposes of this Award Agreement.
Interpretation
The Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions that may arise in connection with the Award or this Award Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding
the Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with
this Award Agreement or the Plan.

Exhibit 10.35
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries
and/or its Affiliates (collectively the “Company”) and will learn and have access to the Company’s confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company
to protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me a stock option or other equity grants unless
I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given a stock option or other equity grants in exchange
for my agreeing to the terms of this Award Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have
access to Confidential Information. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data,
information, ideas, concepts, discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations,
improvements, know-how, developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs,
plans, patterns, models, plans and strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or
medium (whether merely remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing,
relating to or arising from the past, current or potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without
limitation, any such information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing,
personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not,
directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of
Executive’s assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either during the period of Executive’s Service or at any time
thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary information received from third parties subject to a duty
on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain limited
purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive’s Service. The foregoing shall not apply to
information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known to the public
subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is
required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive provides
the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in seeking a
protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or
State Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or
local government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive
may disclose trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.
Finally, if Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may
disclose the trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document
containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive’s
Exhibit 10.35
right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the government, participate in investigations, testify in
proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any activities protected under whistle blower statutes.
Nothing in or about this Award Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act,
maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the Commission, (ii) providing the Commission with information that would
otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this Award Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii)
cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving
a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the
Company, (ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and
inappropriately assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a
competitor, Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships
with its customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will
receive specialized training from the Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the
Company in the course of Executive’s Service. Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for twelve (12) months following a
termination of Executive’s Service for any reason (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not engage in any business activities,
directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal,
agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of
business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the
Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food
and beverage industry (“Competitive Business”) anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive
performed services for the Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit
Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation
engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of
such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other
entity, solicit, aid, induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any
customer or potential customer of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm,
corporation or other entity or, directly or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel
any of their business or refuse to continue to do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential
customers who, during the two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by
the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about
which the Executive had access to Confidential Information by virtue of Executive’s employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other
entity, (A) solicit, aid or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to
accept employment with or render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the
Company or hire or retain any such employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person,
firm, corporation or other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or
Exhibit 10.35
agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its
vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term “solicit, aid or induce” includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating
communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or other compensation to
encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and accept employment with any entity, (iii)
recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a Company employee. An employee,
representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for a period of six (6) months
thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in
(a) response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including,
without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the
Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products,
developments, software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product
(“Inventions”), whether patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed,
contributed to, or improved with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive’s work with the
Company or that relate to the business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the
Company, and that are made or conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive’s Service, or (B)
suggested by any work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties
with the Company or on Executive’s own time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee
or other service provider to the Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or
other applications for intellectual property protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the
“Records”), in the manner prescribed by the Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely
and in writing to the Company. The Records shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will
surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the Company’s request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and
assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all
countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service, together with the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name
of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and equivalent rights (the “Applications”). Executive will, at any time
during and subsequent to Executive’s Service, make such applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all
other acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record,enforce, protect, patent or register the
Company’s rights in the Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also
execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable
assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company’s benefit, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the Company’s expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States,
on behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying
rights therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further
obligations to Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such
Inventions do not otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to
the Company,
Exhibit 10.35
all rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and
extensions thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter
recognized, including, without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the
Inventions, to exploit and allow others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or
other unauthorized use or conduct in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including,
without limitation, the right to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called
“moral rights” with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of
Executive’s service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally
waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to
the Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without
limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive’s benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other
service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at
any time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not
limited to, any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or
documents and property belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Award Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the
Company assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement,
including the restraints imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of
the Company and its Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter,
length of time and geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from
obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that
each of these covenants has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient
assets and skills to provide a livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not
challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Award Agreement, and
Exhibit 10.35
that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action
to enforce any of the provisions of this Award Agreement if either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such
dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this Award Agreement. It is also
agreed that the “Company” as used in this Award Agreement refers to each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates and
that each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive’s obligations to that
Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Award Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of
the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Award
Agreement is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties
that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws
of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of
the provisions of this Award Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of
such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall
be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent
injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in
addition to any other equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a
matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Award Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach”
as such term is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s Option and the Shares issued therefor
(as such terms are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of
the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Award Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the
post-termination restrictions contained in this Award Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such
violation, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be
tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Award Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or
expiration of the Executive’s Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be
brought with respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement,
regardless of where Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives
Executive’s rights, if any, to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement
decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection which Executive now or hereafter may
Exhibit 10.35
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or
claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in
any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation, construction,
application, validity, and enforcement of this Award Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of
the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and Options) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed
by April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the Options. The
Options must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If
Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market
value of the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should
speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if
no tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or

JAPAN
NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
If you remit more than ¥30 million for the purchase of Shares in a single transaction, you must file a Payment Report with the Ministry of
Finance (through the Bank of Japan or the bank carrying out the transaction). The precise reporting requirements vary depending on whether
the relevant payment is made through a bank in Japan. If you acquire Shares whose value exceeds ¥100 million in a single transaction, you
must also file a Report Concerning Acquisition Shares (“Securities Acquisition Report”) with the Ministry of Finance through the Bank of
Japan within 20 days of acquiring the Shares. The forms to make these reports can be acquired from the Bank of Japan.
A Payment Report is required independently from a Securities Acquisition Report. Therefore, if the total amount that you pay upon a one-
time transaction for exercising the Option and acquiring Shares exceeds ¥100 million, you must file both a Payment Report and a Securities
Acquisition Report.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Japanese tax resident, you will be required to report details of any assets held outside of Japan as of December 31st (including

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered Options (which, upon exercise in accordance with the terms of the grant of the Options, will be converted
into Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares
are quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information
is designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee
share scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the Options or administration of the Plan. This Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the
securities described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia. In no event will Shares issued
upon exercise of the Option be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exchange Control and Repatriation Information.

as soon as you intend to use those cash amounts for any purpose, including reinvestment. You are responsible for complying with any
applicable Russian exchange control and repatriation regulations and rulings. Because Russian exchange control and repatriation regulations
and rulings change frequently and without notice, you should consult with a legal advisor to ensure compliance applicable to any aspect of
your participation in the Plan, including the grant, vesting and exercise of the Options, issuance of any Shares at exercise, receipt of any
proceeds from the sale of Shares and/or receipt of any payments in connection with any Dividend Equivalents or dividends.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant Options under the Plan to individuals who
may be employees of the Company’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into

in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the Options are granted on the assumption and condition that the Options or the Shares
acquired upon exercise shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and shall not be
considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you
understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and
freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the
Options shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the Options is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
Options will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,

join the Board of Directors [under applicable law], you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección

foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to
the Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of
the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain
with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on
your tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for
Exhibit 10.35

reported rights or assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.

also agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and your employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or
withhold or have paid or will pay on your behalf to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of the Act), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will
not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax due is not collected from or paid by you within ninety (90)
days of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount of any uncollected tax may
constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable. You acknowledge that you
ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-
assessment regime and for paying the Company or your employer (as applicable) for the value of any employee national insurance
contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or your employer may obtain from you by any of the means referred to
in the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I.

Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the PSUs,
without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but between the second-year and third-year anniversaries of the Grant Date, the Company terminates
your Service Without Cause (as defined in the Award Agreement below), the vesting of the Performance Share Award Share Payout (as
defined below) shall accelerate upon such termination of Service as if 50% of the Performance Share Award Share Payout had vested on the
second-year anniversary of the Grant Date. If prior to the Vesting Date your Service terminates by reason of your death or Disability (as
defined below), 100% of the Performance Share Award Share Payout shall become fully vested. If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than
two (2) years after the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your Retirement (as defined below), 100% of the Performance Share
Award Share Payout shall become fully vested. The Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be determined by the Committee based on
actual performance at the end of the Performance Period and settled once the Committee certifies the results of the Performance Period.
For purposes of the PSUs, your Service will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively providing Service to
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with no anticipated return to active Service (regardless of the reason for such termination
and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of
your Employment Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in the Award Agreement or determined by the Company,
your right to vest in the PSUs, if any, under the Plan will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your
period of Service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any). The Committee shall
have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs (including whether
you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Dividends: The PSUs will not be entitled to accrue any dividends declared
on the Shares, including any Dividend Equivalents as defined
by the Plan.
Exhibit 10.36

i.Vesting. The Performance Share Award will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in the Notice subject to your continued
Service with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or this Agreement.
Prior to the vesting and settlement of the Performance Share Award, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with
respect to the Performance Share Award or the Shares subject thereto. No Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of
the Performance Share Award unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Agreement and the Plan and (ii)
the vesting of the Performance Share Award and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law. Until such time as
the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends, including any Dividend Equivalents as
defined by the Plan, or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the
Performance Share Award.
ii.Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, any Performance Share Award that
becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered in your name. In the
event the Performance Share Award Share Payout is to be made in Shares results in less than a whole number of Shares, the
Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be rounded up or down to the next whole Share (no fractional Shares shall be

Equivalents as defined by the Plan.
iv.Payment Timing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21 hereof or in the Notice, as applicable, (A) the Performance
Share Award payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date, but in any event no later than March
15 of the taxable year following the Vesting Date and (B) a Performance Share Award that becomes payable due to a
termination due to your Retirement, death or Disability, shall be paid no later than sixty (60) days after the Vesting Date.
v.Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If you are
terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of
Exhibit 10.36
your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the
date the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be
retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been
terminated for Cause).
b.Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
i.The Performance Share Award shall not become payable to you or your legal representative unless and until you or your
legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 5
below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
ii.The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to the
fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the
Shares are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal
law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or other
governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary and advisable,
or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares would be
exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from
any state, federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be
necessary or advisable and (D) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the Performance Share
Award becomes payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience,
subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
c.Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for full or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of your active employment for any reason
prior to the completion of a Performance Period to which a Performance Share Award relates; provided that the Committee shall
not exercise such discretion if doing so would cause other Performance Share Awards that are intended to qualify as Qualified
Performance-Based Compensation not to qualify.
4. Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any
or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and
legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is
and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Furthermore, you
acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related
Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Award or the underlying Shares, including, but not limited to, the grant,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award;
and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant of the Performance Share Award or any aspect of
your participation in the Plan to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. If you are or
become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former
employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for (including report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Exhibit 10.36
The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of the
Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the number of
Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from a Performance Share Award Share Payout
or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of
Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.
The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting or
payment of this Performance Share Award, the sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award or hypothetical withholding
tax amounts if you are covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts from
any proceeds realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by you. Such
open-market sale is on your behalf and at your direction pursuant to this authorization.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the
granting, vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the
case may be, by withholding from your wages, or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company and/or the Employer.
If you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, the Participant may elect the form of withholding in advance of
any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the number of Shares
having an aggregate value equal to the amount of any withholding for Tax-Related Items due from the Performance Share Award Share
Payout, or the Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any withholding for Tax-Related Items.
Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at the
Fair Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount giving rise
to the withholding requirement first became includible in your gross income under applicable tax laws. The Company may refuse to issue or
deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your Tax-Related Items obligations. The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related
Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and
will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of
under-withholding, you may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company
and/or the Employer.
You shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to
withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If you are covered by a Company tax equalization policy, you also agree
to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and conditions of such tax equalization
policy.
5. Nature of Grant. By participating in the Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, you acknowledge,
understand and agree that:
a.the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan;

c.all decisions with respect to future Performance Share Award grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Board of

transaction affecting the Shares; and
If you reside outside the U.S., the following additional provisions shall apply:

salary from the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for
the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;
l.no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages, including pro-rated compensation or damages, shall arise from forfeiture of
the Performance Share Award resulting from failure to reach Performance Goals or termination of your employment by the
Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country
where you reside or later found to be invalid), and in consideration of the grant of the Performance Share Award to which you are
otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waive your
ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed
irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or
withdrawal of such claims; and
m.neither the Company, the Employer nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Share Award, any Shares paid to you or any
proceeds resulting from your sale of such Shares.
6. Data Privacy.
Exhibit 10.36
a.Data Collection and Usage. The Company collects, processes and uses personal data about you, including but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, employee
identification number, hire date, termination date, gross earnings, tax rate, account identification number for the independent
stock plan service provider account, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all PSUs or any other
entitlement to shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor,
which the Company receives from you or the Employer (“Data”) for the purposes of implementing, administering and
managing the Plan. The Company will only use your personal data where expressly permitted by law. Generally, the Company
will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•When needed to execute a contract that the Company is going to formalize or that the Company has formalized with you.
•Where necessary for the Company’s legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that the fundamental interests
or rights that assist you do not prevail over our interests or those of that third party.
•When the Company needs it to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation.
b.Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company may transfer Data to one or more independent stock plan service
providers, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Such service
provider(s) may open an account for you or ask you to receive and trade shares of common stock. You may be asked to
acknowledge, or agree to, separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider(s) with such agreement
being a condition of participation in the Plan. Please review these terms and data processing practices carefully. If you do not
agree to the independent stock plan service provider’s terms and/or data processing practices, you will not be able to
participate in the Plan.
c.International Data Transfers. Please note that Data processed in connection with the Plan will be transferred from your
country to the United States, where the Company and its service providers are based. Your country or jurisdiction may have
different data privacy laws and protections than the United States. The Company will ensure that appropriate measures are in
place for compliance with applicable data protection laws in relation to transfer of Data to the United States.
d.Data Retention. The Company has a legal duty to keep various records and records need to be held for different periods of
time, depending on their contents. The Company will use your personal data only as long as necessary to implement,
administer and manage your participation in the Plan and as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations,
including under tax and securities laws. The Company will therefore keep your personal data for as long as needed in
connection with those obligations. The Company will not keep your personal data for longer than data protection law allows.

transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and
Exhibit 10.36
distribution, and may not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise pledged and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, in violation of the provisions herein, the Performance
Share Award shall immediately become null and void and any rights to receive a payment under the Performance Share Award shall be
forfeited.
8. Rights as Shareholder. Neither you nor any person claiming under or through you shall have any of the rights or privileges of a
shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be
in uncertificated form) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and
delivered to you (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, you shall have
all the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive any cash or Share
dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.
9. Repayment/Forfeiture. As an additional condition of receiving the Performance Share Award, you agree that the Performance Share
Award and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company (i)
under the terms of the Company’s Clawback Policy, as may be amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed
incorporated into this Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the
rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Section 10D of the Act and
Rule 10D-1 thereunder. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms of the Performance
Share Award for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative
error), all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company.
10. Restrictions on Resale. You hereby agree not to sell any Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award at a time when
applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply as long as your employment continues and for such period of
time after the termination of your employment as the Company may specify.
11. Language. You acknowledge that you are sufficiently proficient in the English language or have consulted with an advisor who is

provided, however, that to the extent that the Performance Share Award constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the
Performance Share Award that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will occur within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date.
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan regarding the effect of a Change in Control on the Performance Share Award
and the terms of this Agreement or any Employment Agreement, the terms of the Plan will govern.
13. Securities Laws. By accepting a Performance Share Award, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or
the Company’s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation,
sales of Shares acquired in connection with the Performance Share Award. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and
Company policies, as such laws and policies are amended from time to time.
14. Adjustments. The Performance Goals, as well as the manner in which the Performance Share Award payment is calculated is subject
to adjustment in the Committee’s sole discretion in accordance with Section 10(b) of the Plan and the Notice. You shall be notified of such
adjustment and such adjustment shall be binding upon the Company and you.

submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware, U.S.A., and agree that such litigation shall be conducted in the courts of Wilmington

to you or your beneficiary upon your “separation from service,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; provided that if you are a
“specified employee,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent the Performance Share Award constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such Shares shall be transferred to you or your
beneficiary upon the earlier to occur of (i) the six-month anniversary of such separation from service and (ii) the date of your death.
This Agreement may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code in a
particular circumstance or that is necessary or desirable to satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A of the Code, but the Company
shall not be under any obligation to make any such amendment. Nothing in the Agreement shall provide a basis for any person to take action
against the Company or any Affiliate based on matters covered by Section 409A of the Code, including the tax treatment of any amount paid

including taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
25. No Advice Regarding Performance Share Award. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the

terms and conditions set forth in Appendix I to this Agreement for your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in

27. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or

Exhibit 10.36
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively, the “Company”) and will learn and have access to the Company’s confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company
to protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other
equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given PSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have
access to Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data, information, ideas,
concepts, discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-
how, developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models,
plans and strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely
remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from
the past, current or potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such
information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers,
suppliers, vendors, raw partners and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly,
use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive’s assigned duties
and for the benefit of the Company, either during the period of Executive’s Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential
Information or other confidential or proprietary information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company’s part to
maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which
shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive’s Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to
the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive
through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law,
regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the
contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection
of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or
State Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or
local government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive
may disclose trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.
Finally, if Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may
disclose the trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document
containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive’s right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate
Exhibit 10.36
in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any activities protected under
whistle blower statutes. Specifically, nothing in this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision prohibits Executive from:
(i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the Commission; (ii)
providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate this provision, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the
Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv)
receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the
Company, (ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and
inappropriately assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a
competitor, Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships
with its customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will
receive specialized training from the Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the
Company in the course of Executive’s Service. Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for twelve (12) months following a
termination of Executive’s Service for any reason (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not engage in any business activities,
directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal,
agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of
business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the
Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food
and beverage industry (“Competitive Business”) anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive
performed services for the Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit
Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation
engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of
such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other
entity, solicit, aid, induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any
customer or potential customer of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm,
corporation or other entity or, directly or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel
any of their business or refuse to continue to do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential
customers who, during the two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by
the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about
which the Executive had access to Confidential Information by virtue of Executive’s employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other
entity, (A) solicit, aid or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to
accept employment with or render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the
Company or hire or retain any such employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person,
firm, corporation or other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid
or induce any other person or entity in interfering, with the
Exhibit 10.36
relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term “solicit, aid or induce” includes,
but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses
or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and accept
employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained
and for a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in
(a) response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including,
without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the
Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products,
developments, software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product
(“Inventions”), whether patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed,
contributed to, or improved with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive’s work with the
Company or that relate to the business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the
Company, and that are made or conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive’s Service, or (B)
suggested by any work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties
with the Company or on Executive’s own time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee
or other service provider to the Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or
other applications for intellectual property protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the
“Records”), in the manner prescribed by the Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely
and in writing to the Company. The Records shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will
surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the Company’s request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and
assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all
countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service, together with the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name
of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and equivalent rights (the “Applications”). Executive will, at any time
during and subsequent to Executive’s Service, make such applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all
other acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the
Company’s rights in the Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also
execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable
assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company’s benefit, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the Company’s expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States,
on behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying
rights therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further
obligations to Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such
Inventions do not otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to
the Company, all rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in
Exhibit 10.36
perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the copyrights (and
all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature
now or hereafter recognized, including, without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions
to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any
infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof,
including, without limitation, the right to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any
so-called “moral rights” with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of
Executive’s service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally
waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to
the Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without
limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive’s benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other
service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at
any time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not
limited to, any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or
documents and property belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants
has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a
livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if
either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the provisions of this Agreement. It is also agreed that the “Company” as used in this Agreement refers
to each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the
right to enforce all of Executive’s obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to
any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this
Agreement is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties
that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws
of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a
breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be
entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent
injunction or any other equitable remedy
Exhibit 10.36
which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other equitable relief
(including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach” as such
term is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof
(as such terms are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of
the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-
termination restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during
any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of
the Executive’s Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be
brought with respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement,
regardless of where Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives
Executive’s rights, if any, to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement
decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably
covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in
the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this
Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Exhibit 10.36
APPENDIX I
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2020 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance Share Units (referred to herein as PSUs) granted to
you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in
addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not
defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the PSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as
of January 2023. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the PSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the PSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the PSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement
(or other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the PSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the PSUs.
Exhibit 10.36
Performance Share Award Payment.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the PSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is
administratively burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the PSUs in the form of Shares but require you to
sell such Shares immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, the Award Agreement shall
give the Company the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination Without Cause, Death and Disability / Payout Upon Termination.
The following provision supplements the termination provisions of the Award Notice and Award Agreement, provided, however, that if you
are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the PSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of
your Separation from Service:
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the PSUs upon termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Notice and
Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time
you cease to provide Service and the PSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Withholding Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (as applicable).
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other
applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s). If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied
by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Plan.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the PSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the PSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or
Exhibit 10.36
your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or
rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the
Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or
amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the

CANADA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Plan Document Acknowledgment.
In accepting the grant of PSUs, you acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan, have reviewed the Plan and the Award
Agreement in their entirety and fully understand and accept all provisions of the Plan and the Award Agreement.
Payout of PSUs in Shares Only.
Pursuant to its discretion under Section 10(d) of the Plan, with respect to all employees residing in Canada, the Company will convert all
vested PSUs only into an equivalent number of Shares. If you reside in Canada (or in the event of your death, your legal representative or
estate) you will not receive an equivalent or fractional Share cash payment with respect to the vested PSUs.
Termination.
The following provision replaces the last paragraph of the Effect of Termination of Service on Vesting section of the Award Agreement:
In the event of your termination of Service (whether or not later found to be invalid or unlawful for any reason, including for breaching
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), unless provided
otherwise by the Company: (i) your right to vest in the PSUs (if any) will terminate effective, as of the earlier of (1) the date you receive
notice of termination, or (2) the date you are no longer providing Service regardless of any period during which notice, pay in lieu of notice
or related payments or damages are provided or required to be provided under local law. You will not earn or be entitled to any pro-rated
vesting for that portion of time before the date on which your right to vest terminates, nor will you be entitled to any compensation for lost
vesting, in all cases, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under applicable Canadian employment
laws (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
employment standards legislation explicitly requires continued entitlement to vesting during a statutory notice period, your right to vest in the
PSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the last day of your minimum statutory notice period, but you will not earn or be
entitled to pro-rated vesting if the vesting date falls after the end of your statutory notice period, nor will you be entitled to any compensation
for lost vesting.

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of
the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and PSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed
by April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the PSUs. The PSUs
must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares
are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of
the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak
with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.
CHILE

Securities Law Information.
The private offering of the RSUs starts on the Grant Date and is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Commission for the

CMF, and therefore such securities are not subject to its oversight. Given that these securities are not registered in Chile, there is no
obligation from the issuer to provide public information on them in Chile. These securities cannot be subject to public offering in Chile while
they are not registered at the corresponding securities registry in Chile.
CHINA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following provisions apply if you are subject to the exchange control regulations or restrictions in the People’s Republic of China
(“China”), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:
Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Payment section of the Award Agreement:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force
the sale of any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your Service, (iii) following your transfer to another
Subsidiary or Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree
that you must maintain any Shares acquired under the Plan in an account at a broker designated by the Company (“Designated Account”).
All Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the
termination of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all
Shares acquired under the Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the
expiration of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).
You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant to this authorization) and you expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. You
acknowledge that the Company’s
Exhibit 10.36
designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the sale of the Shares, the
Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any obligation to satisfy
Tax-Related Items. You agree that if you sell Shares that you acquire under the Plan, the repatriation requirements described below shall
apply.
If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of
China, you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion. The Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or
advisable to comply with local regulations.
Exchange Control Restriction.
You understand and agree that, due to exchange control laws in China, you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby
consent and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds
from your participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) is under no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due
to exchange control restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your
proceeds are delivered to such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.
You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance

WARNING - You are being offered PSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the PSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information
is designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee
share scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the PSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the

upon vesting of the PSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exchange Control Information.
You are responsible for complying with any applicable Russian exchange control regulations and rulings. Because Russian exchange control

proceeds from the sale of Shares and/or receipt of any payments in connection with any Dividend Equivalents or dividends.

Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial

Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the PSUs are granted on the assumption and
condition that the PSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other
right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to
above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be
met for any reason, then the PSUs shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the PSUs is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
PSUs will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject
to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without
cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the
Workers’ Statute, and/or Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal
Decree 1382/1985. Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the PSUs granted
to you that were unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

Securities Law Information.
The PSUs and the Shares issued pursuant to the vesting of the PSUs do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of
securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has
not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident and you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to
join the Board of Directors, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones (the “DGCI”) for statistical purposes. This declaration must be made in January for any Shares owned as of December 31 of the
prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds €1,502,530, the declaration must
be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you wish to import the ownership
title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to
the Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of
the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain
with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on
your tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for
subsequent years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously
reported rights or assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

If you are a Thai resident and you receive funds in connection with the Plan (e.g., dividends or sale proceeds) with a value equal to or greater
than US$1,000,000 per transaction, you are required to immediately repatriate such funds to Thailand. Any foreign currency repatriated to
Thailand must be

the details of the foreign currency transaction, including your identification information and the purpose of the transaction.
If you do not comply with the above obligations, you may be subject to penalties assessed by the Bank of Thailand. Because exchange
control regulations change frequently and without notice, you should consult your legal advisor before selling any Shares (or receiving any
other funds in connection with the Plan) to ensure compliance with current regulations. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all
exchange control laws in Thailand, and neither the Company nor your employer will be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from failure

TERMS & CONDITIONS
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Withholding Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and
Conditions section of this Appendix I:
Without limitation to the Withholding Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this
Appendix I, you agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when
requested by the Company or your employer or by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant
Exhibit 10.36
authority). You also agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and your employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are
required to pay or withhold or have paid or will pay on your behalf to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of the Act), the terms of the immediately
foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax due is not collected from or paid
by you within ninety (90) days of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount
of any uncollected tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable.
You acknowledge that you ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to
HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying the Company or your employer (as applicable) for the value of any employee
national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or your employer may obtain from you by any of the

Exhibit 10.37
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2020 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
2023 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
Unless defined in this award agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto, this “Award Agreement”),
capitalized terms will have the same meanings ascribed to them in The Kraft Heinz Company 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be
amended from time to time, the “Plan”).
Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the “RSUs”)
as of the Grant Date set forth below (the “Grant Date”). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of
The Kraft Heinz Company’s (the “Company”) common stock on the following terms and subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is
incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of
the Plan will govern.
Number of RSUs: _______________
Grant Date: _______________
Vesting Date: Seventy-Five Percent (75%) on 3-year anniversary of Grant
Date; and remaining Twenty-five Percent (25%) on 4-year
anniversary of Grant Date (subject to the terms of the Award
Agreement).
 
By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit A, the Restrictive Covenants Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
Exhibit 10.37
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Vesting
The RSUs will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in this Award Agreement subject to your continued Service (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, service as a consultant or advisor) with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except as otherwise set forth
in the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled “Termination”). Prior to the vesting and
settlement of the RSUs, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares subject thereto.
Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below
titled “Settlement of Vested RSUs.” However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs prior to the fulfillment of all of
the following conditions: (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs
and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law, (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items
(as defined below), (iv) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares are then listed, (v) the completion
of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute
discretion, deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the
issuance of the Shares would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (vi) the obtaining of any approval or other
clearance from any state, federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be
necessary or advisable and (vii) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the RSUs become payable as the
Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with
respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.
Dividend Equivalents
If while the RSUs are outstanding the Board declares a cash dividend on the Company’s common stock, you will be entitled to
Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date established by the Company equal to the cash dividends payable on the same number of
Shares as the number of unvested RSUs subject to this award on the dividend record date established by the Company. Any such Dividend
Equivalents will be in the form of additional RSUs, will be subject to the same terms and vesting dates as the underlying RSUs, and will be
delivered at the same time and in the same manner as the underlying RSUs originally subject to this award. The number of additional RSUs
credited as Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date will be determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of your
unvested RSUs as of the corresponding dividend record date (including any unvested Restricted Stock Units previously credited as a result of
prior payments of Dividend Equivalents) and (B) the per-Share cash dividend paid on the dividend payment date, by (ii) the per-share Fair
Market Value of the Shares on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole RSU.
Exhibit 10.37
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,
including any accrued Dividend Equivalents, without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without Cause (as
defined below), the vesting of your RSUs (plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall accelerate upon such
termination of Service as if 25% of the RSUs had vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date on which you provided Service. If
prior to the Vesting Date your Service terminates by reason of your death or Disability (as defined below), your RSUs (plus any Dividend
Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall become fully vested upon such termination of Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but
more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your Retirement (as defined below) your RSUs (plus any
Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall become fully vested upon such termination of Service.
For purposes of the RSUs, your Service will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively providing Service to
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with no anticipated return to active Service (regardless of the reason for such termination
and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of
your Employment Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company,
your right to vest in the RSUs, if any, under the Plan will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your
period of Service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any). The Committee shall
have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether
you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Settlement of Vested RSUs
To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such
delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which will vary depending on the applicable vesting
event.
Vesting Event Settlement Period
Vesting Date As soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following the
Vesting Date
Termination of Service Without Cause Within 60 days of your termination date*
Retirement Within 60 days of your termination date*
Disability Within 60 days of your termination date*
Death Within 60 days of the date of death
*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code, that is not exempt from
Exhibit 10.37
Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, as determined by the Company (“Deferred Compensation”), settlement will
occur within this period only if your termination of Service constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code (“Separation from Service”); otherwise, settlement will occur in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as
practicable and no later than sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company determines that you are a “specified
employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are Deferred Compensation and are subject to settlement upon
your Separation from Service will instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such
Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code to avoid additional taxes
and penalties under Section 409A of the Code.
Applicable Definitions
All capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement without definition shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. For purposes of
this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
“Disability” means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
“disability” (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
“Employment Agreement” means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including an offer letter.
“Retirement” means a termination of Service by you on or after either (a) the later of (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your completion
of five years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates; or (b) the later of (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your completion
of ten years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
“Without Cause” means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines “Good
Reason”, then “Without Cause” shall also include resignation of your Service for “Good Reason” in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service
on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could
Exhibit 10.37
have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of
termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of
this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a
termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your
Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the RSUs upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the
RSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will
occur within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan regarding the effect
of a Change in Control on the RSUs and the terms of this Award Agreement or any Employment Agreement, the terms of the Plan will
govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key
business relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such
entities. As such, in partial consideration of the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company’s
Restrictive Covenants Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations
contained in the Restrictive Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Taxes
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all
income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related
Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
any aspect of the RSU grant or the underlying Shares, including but not limited to the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the
subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not
commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to vesting of the RSUs, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation payable to you or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the
Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-
Related Items, and/or (B) withhold the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount, or to the extent permitted by
applicable accounting principles, withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable withholding rate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, you may elect the form of withholding in advance of
any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of your election, the Company shall withhold the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-
Exhibit 10.37
Related Items due upon the vesting of the RSUs, or the Committee may determine that a particular alternative method must be used to satisfy
any withholding for Tax Related Items.
Further, the Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of the RSUs or sale of Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of the withholding due for any Tax-Related Items or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If
the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be
deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for
the purpose of such withholding.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the withholding for any Tax-Related Items arising from the
granting, vesting, or payment of this Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Award, as the case may be, by withholding from the
Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer. In the event of over-withholding, you may
receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent or if not refunded, you may seek a
refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly
to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer.
Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above
titled “Termination”) is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You
further acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be
construed as giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
Affiliates. Further, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this
Award is not intended to confer any rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company’s Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of
Section 409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall
be made by the Committee.
Exhibit 10.37
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
a.the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
b.the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;
c.all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;
d.your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
e.the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries;
f.the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation or
salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, holiday pay, long-
service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
g.the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
h.unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of
same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;
i.no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages, including pro-rated compensation or damages, shall arise from forfeiture of the
RSU resulting from termination of your Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of
the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating
in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to
request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and
j.the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments, Repurchases
and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell
Exhibit 10.37
Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law
requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
a.Data Collection and Usage. The Company collects, processes and uses personal data about you, including but not limited to, your
name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, employee identification number, hire
date, termination date, gross earnings, tax rate, account identification number for the independent stock plan service provider account,
any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares or equivalent benefits
awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, which the Company receives from you or the Employer
(“Data”) for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. The Company will only use your personal data where
expressly permitted by law. Generally, the Company will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•When needed to execute a contract that the Company is going to formalize or that the Company has formalized with you.
•Where necessary for the Company’s legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that the fundamental interests or
rights that assist you do not prevail over our interests or those of that third party.
•When the Company needs it to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation.
b.Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company may transfer Data to one or more independent stock plan service
providers, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Such service provider(s)
may open an account for you or ask you to receive and trade shares of common stock. You may be asked to acknowledge, or agree to,
separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider(s) with such agreement being a condition of participation in the
Plan. Please review these terms and data processing practices carefully. If you do not agree to the independent stock plan service
provider’s terms and/or data processing practices, you will not be able to participate in the Plan.
c.International Data Transfers. Please note that Data processed in connection with the Plan will be transferred from your country
to the United States, where the Company and its service providers are based. Your country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy
laws and protections than the United States. The Company will ensure that appropriate measures are in place for compliance with
applicable data protection laws in relation to transfer of Data to the United States.
d.Data Retention. The Company has a legal duty to keep various records and records need to be held for different periods of time,
depending on their contents. The Company will use your personal data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and manage
your participation in the Plan and as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and securities laws. The
Company will therefore keep your personal data for as long as needed in connection with those obligations. The Company will not keep

excess amount to the Company.

RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or
other party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that

Exhibit 10.37
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries
and/or its Affiliates (collectively the “Company”) and will learn and have access to the Company’s confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company
to protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Restricted Stock Units (the “ RSUs”) or
other equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given RSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Award Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have access
to Confidential Information. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data, information, ideas,
concepts, discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive’s assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive’s Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and
to use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive’s
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted
by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its
expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or
State Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or
local government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may
disclose trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally,
if Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. No Company policies or practices, including this
Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit, prevent, impede or interfere in any way with
Executive’s right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the government, participate in investigations, testify in
proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any activities protected under whistle blower statutes. Nothing
in this Non-Disclosure of Confidential
Exhibit 10.37
Information provision prohibits Executive from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the
confidentiality of a claim with the Commission; (ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate this
provision, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or
proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company,
(ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and
inappropriately assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a competitor,
Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its
customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive
specialized training from the Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the
course of Executive’s Service. Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for twelve (12) months following a termination of
Executive’s Service for any reason (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly
(whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent
contractor, individually, in concert with others, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive
performed services for the Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the
Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry
(“Competitive Business”) anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the
Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive
owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in
competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity,
solicit, aid, induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or
potential customer of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or
other entity or, directly or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business
or refuse to continue to do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the
two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the
Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to
Confidential Information by virtue of Executive’s employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity,
(A) solicit, aid or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept
employment with or render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire
or retain any such employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or
other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other
person or entity in interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the
term “solicit, aid or induce” includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible
employment, (ii) offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the
Company and accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a
Exhibit 10.37
Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a Company employee. An employee, representative or agent
shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product (“Inventions”), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved with
the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive’s work with the Company or that relate to the business,
operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or conceived by
Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive’s Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive performs in
connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties with the Company or on Executive’s own time, but only
insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee or other service provider to the Company, shall belong
exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property protection are filed
thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the “Records”), in the manner prescribed by the Company, of all
Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the Company’s
request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other intellectual
property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service, together with
the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and equivalent rights
(the “Applications”). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive’s Service, make such applications, sign such
papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record,
enforce, protect, patent or register the Company’s rights in the Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the
Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications and give the Company and
its attorneys all reasonable assistance(including the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company’s benefit, all
without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the Company’s expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights,
in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without
limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) to the
Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including, without
limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to
exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct in
derogation of the Inventions,
Exhibit 10.37
known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In
addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called “moral rights” with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any
rights in the results and proceeds of Executive’s service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein,
Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing
and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may issue
thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive’s benefit by virtue of Executive being an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Award Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the
Company assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, including
the restraints imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company
and its Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a
livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Award Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Award Agreement if
either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the provisions of this Award Agreement. It is also agreed that the “Company” as used in this Award
Agreement refers to each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company’s
Exhibit 10.37
Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive’s obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this
Award Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under
applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Award
Agreement is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties
that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of
that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of this Award Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a
breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled
to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any
other equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Award Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach” as
such term is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s RSU and the Shares issued therefor (as such
terms are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Award Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-
termination restrictions contained in this Award Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any
period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Award Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration
of the Executive’s Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive’s rights, if any,
to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related
to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to
the interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Award Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising
hereunder, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule,
whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.
Exhibit 10.37
APPENDIX I

2020 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units (referred to herein as RSUs) granted to you
under the Plan if you work or reside outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition
to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the RSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and

NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as
of January 2023. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
Exhibit 10.37
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provision supplements the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement
(or other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is
administratively burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to
sell such Shares immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall
give the Company the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provision supplements the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the Award Agreement titled Settlement of Vested RSUs, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section
of the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time
you cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (as applicable).
Exhibit 10.37
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other
applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s). If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied
by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Plan.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:
If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your
death to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another
individual during your lifetime.

The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:
a. The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights
or compensation.
b. In no event should the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
c. The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected
compensation or salary for any purpose.

local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the
RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in

Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times
as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local
insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside
information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) “tipping” third parties
or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations
are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You
acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this
matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your

country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and acknowledge that you should consult with
your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.

waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

Payout of RSUs in Shares Only.
Pursuant to its discretion under the Settlement of Vested RSUs section of the Award Agreement, with respect to all employees residing in

The following provision replaces the last paragraph of the Termination section of the Award Agreement:
In the event of your termination of Service (whether or not later found to be invalid or unlawful for any reason, including for breaching

otherwise by the Company: (i) your right to vest in the RSUs (if any) will terminate effective, as of the earlier of (1) the date you receive
notice of termination, or (2) the date you are no longer providing Service regardless of any period during which notice, pay in lieu of notice
or related payments or damages are provided or required to be provided under local law. You will not earn or be entitled to any pro-rated
vesting for that portion of time before the date on which your right to vest terminates, nor will you be entitled to any compensation for lost
vesting, in all cases, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under applicable Canadian employment
laws (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
employment standards legislation explicitly requires continued entitlement to vesting during a statutory notice period, your right to vest in the
RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the last day of your minimum statutory notice period, but you will not earn or be
entitled to pro-rated vesting if the vesting date falls after the end of your statutory notice period, nor will you be entitled to any compensation

NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of
the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and RSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed
by April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs
must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares
are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of
the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak
with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.
CHILE

CMF, and therefore such securities are not subject to its oversight. Given that these securities are not registered in Chile, there is no
obligation from the issuer to provide public information on them in Chile. These securities cannot be subject to public offering in Chile while
they are not registered at the corresponding securities registry in Chile.
CHINA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following provisions apply if you are subject to the exchange control regulations or restrictions in the People’s Republic of China
(“China”), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force
the sale of any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your Service, (iii) following your transfer to another
Subsidiary or Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree
that you must maintain any Shares acquired under the Plan in an account at a broker designated by the Company (“Designated Account”).
All Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the
termination of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all
Shares acquired under the Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated
Exhibit 10.37
Account at the expiration of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).

pursuant to this authorization) and you expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. You
acknowledge that the Company’s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon
the sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to
any obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items. You agree that if you sell Shares that you acquire under the Plan, the repatriation requirements
described below shall apply.
If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of
China, you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion. The Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or
advisable to comply with local regulations.
Exchange Control Restriction.
You understand and agree that, due to exchange control laws in China, you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby
consent and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds
from your participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) is under no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due
to exchange control restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your
proceeds are delivered to such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.
You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information
is designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee
share scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.

Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by
these laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

has not been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the grant of the RSUs is not made with a
view to the RSUs or Shares being subsequently offered to another party. You should note that the RSUs are subject to section 257 of the SFA
and you should not make any subsequent sale of Shares in Singapore or any offer of such subsequent sale of Shares subject to the awards in
Singapore, unless such sale or offer in is made: (i) more than six (6) months from the Grant Date or (ii) pursuant to the exemptions under Part

RSUs). These notifications must be made within two (2) business days of acquiring or disposing of any interest in the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition, a notification of your interests in the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate must be made within two (2)

SPAIN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the first paragraph of the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms
and Conditions section of this Appendix I:
By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who
may be employees of the Company’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into
upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and
condition that the RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other
right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to
above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be
met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the RSUs is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
RSUs will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject
to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without
cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the
Workers’ Statute, and/or Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal
Decree 1382/1985. Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the RSUs granted
to you that were unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The RSUs and the Shares issued pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of
securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has
not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident and you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to
join the Board of Directors, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones (the “DGCI”) for statistical purposes. This declaration must be made in January for any Shares owned as of December 31 of the
prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
Exhibit 10.37
€1,502,530, the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if
you wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to
the DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to
the Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of
the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain
with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on
your tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for
subsequent years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously
reported rights or assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I:
Without limiting the Company or your employer’s authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth in the
Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I, you authorize the

withhold such Tax-Related Items.

NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
If you are a Thai resident and you receive funds in connection with the Plan (e.g., dividends or sale proceeds) with a value equal to or greater
than US$1,000,000 per transaction, you are required to immediately repatriate such funds to Thailand. Any foreign currency repatriated to
Thailand must be converted to Thai Baht or deposited into a foreign currency deposit account opened with any commercial bank in Thailand
acting as the authorized agent within 360 days from the date the funds are repatriated to Thailand. You are also required to inform the
authorized agent of the details of the foreign currency transaction, including your identification information and the purpose of the
transaction.
If you do not comply with the above obligations, you may be subject to penalties assessed by the Bank of Thailand. Because exchange
control regulations change frequently and without notice, you should consult

your legal advisor before selling any Shares (or receiving any other funds in connection with the Plan) to ensure compliance with current
regulations. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all exchange control laws in Thailand, and neither the Company nor your
employer will be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from failure to comply with applicable laws.

UNITED KINGDOM
TERMS & CONDITIONS
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of
this Appendix I:
Without limitation to the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I,
you agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the
Company or your employer or
Exhibit 10.37
by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). You also agree to indemnify and keep
indemnified the Company and your employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold or have paid or will
pay on your behalf to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of the Act), the terms of the immediately
foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax due is not collected from or paid
by you within ninety (90) days of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount
of any uncollected tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable.
You acknowledge that you ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to
HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying the Company or your employer (as applicable) for the value of any employee
national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or your employer may obtain from you by any of the
means referred to in the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I.
Exhibit 10.38
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2020 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
2023 MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
Unless defined in this award agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto, this “Award Agreement”),
capitalized terms will have the same meanings ascribed to them in The Kraft Heinz Company 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be
amended from time to time, the “Plan”).
Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the “RSUs”)
as of the Grant Date set forth below (the “Grant Date”). The RSUs are granted in connection with your purchase of Shares in the Company’s
2023 Bonus Investment Plan (formerly the Bonus Swap Program) (the “Related Shares”). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the
right to receive one (1) share of The Kraft Heinz Company’s (the “Company”) common stock on the following terms and subject to the
provisions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award
Agreement, the provisions of the Plan will govern.
Grant Date: March 1, 2023
Vesting Date: 3-year anniversary of Grant Date (subject to the terms of the
Award Agreement)
 
By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit A, the Restrictive Covenants Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
Exhibit 10.38
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Vesting
The RSUs will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in this Award Agreement subject to your continued Service (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, service as a consultant or advisor) with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except as otherwise set forth
in the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled “Termination”), and subject to forfeiture as set
forth in the section below titled “Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs upon the Transfer of Related Shares.” Prior to the vesting and settlement of the
RSUs, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares subject thereto.
Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below
titled “Settlement of Vested RSUs.” However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs prior to the fulfillment of all of
the following conditions: (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs
and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law, (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items
(as defined below), (iv) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares are then listed, (v) the completion
of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute
discretion, deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the
issuance of the Shares would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (vi) the obtaining of any approval or other
clearance from any state, federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be
necessary or advisable and (vii) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the RSUs become payable as the
Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with
respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.
Dividend Equivalents
If while the RSUs are outstanding the Board declares a cash dividend on the Company’s common stock, you will be entitled to
Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date established by the Company equal to the cash dividends payable on the same number of
Shares as the number of unvested RSUs subject to this award on the dividend record date established by the Company. Any such Dividend
Equivalents will be in the form of additional RSUs, will be subject to the same terms and vesting dates as the underlying RSUs, and will be
delivered at the same time and in the same manner as the underlying RSUs originally subject to this award. The number of additional RSUs
credited as Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date will be determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of your
unvested RSUs as of the corresponding dividend record date (including any unvested Restricted Stock Units previously credited as a result of
prior payments of Dividend Equivalents) and (B) the per-Share cash dividend paid on the dividend payment date, by (ii) the per-share Fair
Market Value of the Shares on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole RSU.
Exhibit 10.38
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,
including any accrued Dividend Equivalents, without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without Cause (as
defined below), the vesting of your RSUs (plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall accelerate upon such
termination of Service as if 33.33% of the RSUs had vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date on which you provided Service. If
prior to the Vesting Date your Service terminates by reason of your death or Disability (as defined below), your RSUs (plus any Dividend
Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall become fully vested upon such termination of Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but
more than one (1) year after the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your Retirement (as defined below), your RSUs (plus any
Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall become fully vested upon such termination of Service.
For purposes of the RSUs, your Service will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively providing Service to
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with no anticipated return to active Service (regardless of the reason for such termination
and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of
your Employment Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company,
your right to vest in the RSUs, if any, under the Plan will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your
period of Service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any). The Committee shall
have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether
you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Settlement of Vested RSUs
To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such
delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which will vary depending on the applicable vesting
event.
Vesting Event Settlement Period
Vesting Date As soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following the
Vesting Date
Termination of Service Without Cause Within 60 days of your termination date*
Retirement Within 60 days of your termination date*
Disability Within 60 days of your termination date*
Death Within 60 days of the date of death
Exhibit 10.38
*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that is not exempt from Section 409A of the Code as a short-term deferral or otherwise, as
determined by the Company (“Deferred Compensation”), settlement will occur within this period only if your termination of
Service constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (“Separation from Service”);
otherwise, settlement will occur in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than sixty
(60) days following the Vesting Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company determines that you are a “specified
employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are Deferred Compensation and are subject to settlement upon
your Separation from Service will instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such
Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code to avoid additional taxes
and penalties under Section 409A of the Code.
Applicable Definitions
All capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement without definition shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. For purposes of
this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
“Disability” means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
“disability” (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
“Employment Agreement” means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including an offer letter.
“Retirement” means a termination of Service by you on or after either (a) the later of (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your completion
of five years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates; or (b) the later of (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your completion
of ten years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
“Without Cause” means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines “Good
Reason”, then “Without Cause” shall also include resignation of your Service for “Good Reason” in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service
on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
Exhibit 10.38
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election
of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date
the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied
(including your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the RSUs upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the
RSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will
occur within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan regarding the effect
of a Change in Control on the RSUs and the terms of this Award Agreement or any Employment Agreement, the terms of the Plan will
govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key
business relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such
entities. As such, in partial consideration of the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company’s
Restrictive Covenants Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations
contained in the Restrictive Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs upon the Transfer of Related Shares
Transfer (other than pursuant to the laws of descent) of the Related Shares before the RSUs vest (whether on the Vesting Date or such
earlier date set forth in the section above titled “Termination” or elsewhere in the Award Agreement), will result in immediate forfeiture of all
or a portion of the unvested RSUs granted under this Award Agreement as set forth below:
(i) If you Transfer more than 50% of the Related Shares, you will forfeit all unvested RSUs, including any Dividend Equivalents accrued
with respect to such RSUs.
(ii) If you Transfer 50% or less of the Related Shares (the “Transferred Percentage”), you will forfeit a portion of the unvested RSUs
equal to twice the Transferred Percentage, plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs.
Taxes
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all
income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related
Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
any aspect of the RSU grant or the underlying Shares, including but not
Exhibit 10.38
limited to the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of
any dividends or Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or
eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to vesting of the RSUs, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation payable to you or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the
Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-
Related Items, and/or (B) withhold the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount, or to the extent permitted by
applicable accounting principles, withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable withholding rate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, you may elect the form of withholding in advance of
any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of your election, the Company shall withhold the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items due upon the vesting of the RSUs, or the Committee may determine that a
particular alternative method must be used to satisfy any withholding for Tax Related Items.
Further, the Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of the RSUs or sale of Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of the withholding due for any Tax-Related Items or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If
the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be
deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for
the purpose of such withholding.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the withholding for any Tax-Related Items arising from the
granting, vesting, or payment of this Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Award, as the case may be, by withholding from the
Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer. In the event of over-withholding, you may
receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent or if not refunded, you may seek a
refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly
to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer.
Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above
titled “Termination”) is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You
further acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be
construed as giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Further, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless
otherwise expressly provided in any other agreement
Exhibit 10.38
binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any rights on you except as set
forth in this Award Agreement.
Company’s Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of
Section 409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall
be made by the Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
a. the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
b. the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;
c. all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;
d. your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
e. the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries;
f. the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, holiday pay,

the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any
Exhibit 10.38
such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not
to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and
j. the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments, Repurchases

Securities Laws
By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
a.Data Collection and Usage. The Company collects, processes and uses personal data about you, including but not limited to, your
name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, employee identification number, hire
date, termination date, gross earnings, tax rate, account identification number for the independent stock plan service provider account,
any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares or equivalent benefits
awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, which the Company receives from you or the Employer
(“Data”) for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. The Company will only use your personal data where
expressly permitted by law. Generally, the Company will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•When needed to execute a contract that the Company is going to formalize or that the Company has formalized with you.
•Where necessary for the Company’s legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that the fundamental interests or
rights that assist you do not prevail over our interests or those of that third party.
•When the Company needs it to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation.
b.Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company may transfer Data to one or more independent stock plan service
providers, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Such service provider(s)
may open an account for you or ask you to receive and trade shares of common stock. You may be asked to acknowledge, or agree to,
separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider(s) with such agreement being a condition of participation in the
Plan. Please review these terms and data processing practices carefully. If you do not agree to the independent stock plan service
provider’s terms and/or data processing practices, you will not be able to participate in the Plan.
c.International Data Transfers. Please note that Data processed in connection with the Plan will be transferred from your country
to the United States, where the Company and its service providers are based. Your country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy
laws and protections than the United States. The Company will ensure that appropriate measures are in place for compliance with
applicable data protection laws in relation to transfer of Data to the United States.
Exhibit 10.38
d.Data Retention. The Company has a legal duty to keep various records and records need to be held for different periods of time,
depending on their contents. The Company will use your personal data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and manage
your participation in the Plan and as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and securities laws. The
Company will therefore keep your personal data for as long as needed in connection with those obligations. The Company will not keep
your personal data for longer than data protection law allows.
e.Data Subject Rights. You understand that you may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
Depending on where you are based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access or copies of personal data processed by the
Company, (ii) rectification of incorrect data, (iii) deletion of personal data, (iv) restrictions on processing of personal data, (v) portability
of personal data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent data protection authorities in your jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the

rights, you can contact the Company’s Data Privacy Team at gdpr@kraftheinz.com.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries

Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of
any rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written
notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer
and (ii) the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, to the extent applicable,
as determined by the Company.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the RSUs and without prejudice to the terms of the Company’s Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company (i) under the terms of the Company’s Clawback Policy, as may be amended from time to time
(and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to comply with any
requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on
which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Section 10D of the Act and Rule 10D-1 thereunder. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what
you should have received under the terms of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement,
mistake in calculations or administrative error), all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such
excess amount to the Company.
Section 409A
It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
(“Section 409A”) and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted,
Exhibit 10.38

Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award
Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no
liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party for any tax, additional tax,
interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that any provision of this Award Agreement,
or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed to violate any of the requirements of
Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute
the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings,
representations and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the
Plan, except with your consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.

any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.

consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system
established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic

the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render
it valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the
validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any
Exhibit 10.38
provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable
from the remainder of this Award Agreement, and the remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to
preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent and purposes of this Award Agreement.

Exhibit 10.38
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries
and/or its Affiliates (collectively the “Company”) and will learn and have access to the Company’s confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company
to protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Restricted Stock Units (the “RSUs”) or
other equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given RSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Award Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have access
to Confidential Information. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data, information, ideas,
concepts, discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive’s assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive’s Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and
to use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive’s
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted
by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its
expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or
State Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or
local government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may
disclose trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally,
if Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
Exhibit 10.38
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive’s right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any
activities protected under whistle blower statutes. Nothing in or about this Award Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as
provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the Commission, (ii) providing the
Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this Award Agreement, to the extent
permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or proceeding without
notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company,
(ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and
inappropriately assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a competitor,
Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its
customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive
specialized training from the Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the
course of Executive’s Service. Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for twelve (12) months following a termination of
Executive’s Service for any reason (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly
(whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent
contractor, individually, in concert with others, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive
performed services for the Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the
Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry
(“Competitive Business”) anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the
Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive
owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in
competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity,
solicit, aid, induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or
potential customer of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or
other entity or, directly or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business
or refuse to continue to do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the
two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the
Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to
Confidential Information by virtue of Executive’s employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of
Executive’s duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity,
(A) solicit, aid or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept
employment with or render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire
or retain any such employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or
other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any
Exhibit 10.38
other person or entity in interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein,
the term “solicit, aid or induce” includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to
possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment
with the Company and accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an
entity in recruitment of a Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so
employed or retained and for a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product (“Inventions”), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved with
the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive’s work with the Company or that relate to the business,
operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or conceived by
Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive’s Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive performs in
connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties with the Company or on Executive’s own time, but only
insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee or other service provider to the Company, shall belong
exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property protection are filed
thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the “Records”), in the manner prescribed by the Company, of all
Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the Company’s
request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other intellectual
property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service, together with
the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and equivalent rights
(the “Applications”). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive’s Service, make such applications, sign such
papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record,
enforce, protect, patent or register the Company’s rights in the Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the
Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications and give the Company and
its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company’s benefit, all
without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the Company’s expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights,
in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without
limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the
Exhibit 10.38
copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or
any nature now or hereafter recognized, including, without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and
revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any
infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof,
including, without limitation, the right to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-
called “moral rights” with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of
Executive’s service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally
waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the
Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any
rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive’s benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the
Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Award Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the
Company assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, including
the restraints imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company
and its Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a
livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Award Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Award Agreement if
either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or
enforceability of any of the provisions of this Award Agreement. It is also agreed that the “Company” as used in this Award
Agreement refers to each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and
Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive’s obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Award Agreement,
as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Award
Agreement is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties
that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of
that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of this Award Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a
breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled
to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any
other equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief
Exhibit 10.38
(including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Award Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach” as
such term is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s RSU and the Shares issued therefor (as such
terms are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Award Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-
termination restrictions contained in this Award Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any
period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Award Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration
of the Executive’s Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive’s rights, if any,
to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related
to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to
the interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Award Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising
hereunder, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule,
whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.

information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
Exhibit 10.38
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provision supplements the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement
(or other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is
administratively burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to
sell such Shares immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall
give the Company the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provision supplements the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the Award Agreement titled Settlement of Vested RSUs, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section
of the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time
you cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (as applicable).
Exhibit 10.38
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other
applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s). If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied
by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Plan.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:
If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your
death to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another
individual during your lifetime.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:
a. The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights
or compensation.
b. In no event should the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
c. The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for any purpose.
d. Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Language Consent.
If you are in a country where English is not an official language, you acknowledge that you are sufficiently proficient in English to
understand the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or have had the ability to consult with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient

Exhibit 10.38
acknowledge and agree that it is your express intent that this Award Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal
proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up in English.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times
as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local
insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside
information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) “tipping” third parties
or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations
are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You
acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this
matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any
recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and
acknowledge that you should consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before
taking any action related to the Plan.
Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired
upon vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to
require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company for breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

applicable exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.

NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of
the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and RSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed
by April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs
must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares
are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of
the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak
with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.
CHILE

The private offering of the RSUs starts on the Grant Date and is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Commission for the
Financial Market (“CMF”). This offer refers to securities not registered at the securities registry or at the foreign securities registry of the
CMF, and therefore such securities are not subject to its oversight. Given that these securities are not registered in Chile, there is no
obligation from the issuer to provide public information on them in Chile. These securities cannot be subject to public offering in Chile while
they are not registered at the corresponding securities registry in Chile.

CHINA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following provisions apply if you are subject to the exchange control regulations or restrictions in the People’s Republic of China
(“China”), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:
Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Vesting, Termination and Settlement of Vested RSUs sections of the Award Agreement:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force
the sale of any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your Service, (iii) following your transfer to another
Subsidiary or Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree
that you must maintain any Shares acquired under the Plan in an account at a broker designated by the Company (“Designated Account”).
All Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the
termination of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all
Shares acquired under the Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the
expiration of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).
You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant to this authorization) and you expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. You
acknowledge that the Company’s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon
the sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to
any obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items. You agree that if you sell Shares that you acquire under the Plan, the repatriation requirements
described below shall apply.
If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of
China, you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion. The Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or
advisable to comply with local regulations.
Exchange Control Restriction.
You understand and agree that, due to exchange control laws in China, you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby
consent and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds
from your participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) is under no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due
to exchange control restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your
proceeds are delivered to such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.

Securities Law Information.
The RSUs and Shares offered under the Plan have not been registered with the National Register of Securities maintained by the Mexican
National Banking and Securities Commission and cannot be offered or sold publicly in Mexico. In addition, the Plan, the Award Agreement
and any other document relating to
Exhibit 10.38
the RSUs may not be publicly distributed in Mexico. These materials are addressed to you only because of your existing relationship with the
Company and your employer and these materials should not be reproduced or copied in any form. The offer contained in these materials does
not constitute a public offering of securities but rather constitutes a private placement of securities addressed specifically to individuals who
are present employees of Delimex de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. made in accordance with the provisions of the Mexican Securities Market Law,
and any rights under such offering shall not be assigned or transferred.

NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information
is designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee
share scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.
PANAMA
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The RSUs and the Shares to be issued upon vesting of RSUs are offered in a private transaction. This is not an offer to the public and the
offer is not subject to the protections established by Panamanian securities laws.
Exhibit 10.38
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
There are no country-specific provisions.
POLAND
NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
If you transfer funds in excess of a certain threshold (currently €15,000) into or out of Poland, the funds must be transferred via a Polish bank
account or financial institution. You are required to retain the documents connected with a foreign exchange transaction for a period of five
(5) years, as measured from the end of the year in which such transaction occurred.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Polish residents holding foreign securities (e.g., Shares) and/or maintaining accounts abroad must report information to the National Bank of
Poland on transactions and balances of the securities and cash deposited in such accounts if the value of such securities and cash (when
combined with all other assets possessed abroad) exceeds PLN 7 million. If required, the reports must be filed on a quarterly basis on special

RUSSIA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
U.S. Transaction.
You understand that your acceptance of the RSUs results in a contract between you and the Company that is completed in the United States
and that the Award Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles
thereof. You are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the RSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the
securities described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia. In no event will Shares issued
upon vesting of the RSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exhibit 10.38
Exchange Control Information.
You are responsible for complying with any applicable Russian exchange control regulations and rulings. Because Russian exchange control
regulations and rulings change frequently and without notice, you should consult with a legal advisor to ensure compliance applicable to any
aspect of your participation in the Plan, including the grant and vesting of the RSUs, issuance of any Shares at vesting, receipt of any
proceeds from the sale of Shares and/or receipt of any payments in connection with any Dividend Equivalents or dividends.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.
You also are required to submit an annual cash flow report for any offshore brokerage account, due by June 1 each year for the previous year.
Starting with the reporting year 2021, in addition to the annual cash flow account, you are required to submit an annual financial asset report
on any securities, e.g., Shares, in an offshore brokerage account, due by June 1 each year for the previous year.
Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by
these laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.
SINGAPORE
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The grant of the RSUs is being made pursuant to the “Qualifying Person” exemption under section 273(1)(f) of the Securities and Futures
Act (Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.) (“SFA”), under which it is exempt from the prospectus and registration requirements under the SFA. The Plan
has not been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the grant of the RSUs is not made with a
view to the RSUs or Shares being subsequently offered to another party. You should note that the RSUs are subject to section 257 of the SFA
and you should not make any subsequent sale of Shares in Singapore or any offer of such subsequent sale of Shares subject to the awards in
Singapore, unless such sale or offer in is made: (i) more than six (6) months from the Grant Date or (ii) pursuant to the exemptions under Part
XIII Division (1) Subdivision (4) (other than section 280) of the SFA.
Director Notification Requirement.
If you are a director, associate director or shadow director of the Company’s Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate, you are subject to certain
notification requirements under the Singapore Companies Act. Among these requirements is an obligation to notify the Singapore Subsidiary
or Affiliate in writing when you receive an interest (e.g., RSUs, Shares) in the Company, a Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition, you must
notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate when you sell Shares (including when you sell Shares issued upon vesting and settlement of the
RSUs). These notifications must be made within two (2) business days of acquiring or disposing of any interest in the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition, a notification of your interests in the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate must be made within two (2)
business days of becoming a director. If you are the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of the Company’s Singapore
Exhibit 10.38

above notification requirements also may apply.
SPAIN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the first paragraph of the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms
and Conditions section of this Appendix I:
By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who
may be employees of the Company’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into
upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and
condition that the RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other
right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to
above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be
met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the RSUs is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
RSUs will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject
to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without
cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the
Workers’ Statute, and/or Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal
Decree 1382/1985. Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the RSUs granted
to you that were unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The RSUs and the Shares issued pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of
securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has
not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident and you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to
join the Board of Directors, you must declare the acquisition, ownership
Exhibit 10.38
and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e Inversiones (the “DGCI”) for statistical purposes. This declaration must
be made in January for any Shares owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of
the Shares being reported exceeds €1,502,530, the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the
Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare
the importation of such securities to the DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to
the Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of
the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain
with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on
your tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for
subsequent years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously
reported rights or assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Authorization to Withhold. The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S.
Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I:
Without limiting the Company or your employer’s authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth in the
Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I, you authorize the
Company and your employer to withhold from the Shares or proceeds of the sale of Shares or any other amount otherwise deliverable to you
upon the settlement of the RSUs to satisfy Tax-Related Items, regardless of whether the Company or your employer has an obligation to
withhold such Tax-Related Items.
THAILAND
NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
If you are a Thai resident and you receive funds in connection with the Plan (e.g., dividends or sale proceeds) with a value equal to or greater
than US$1,000,000 per transaction, you are required to immediately repatriate such funds to Thailand. Any foreign currency repatriated to
Thailand must be converted to Thai Baht or deposited into a foreign currency deposit account opened with any commercial bank in Thailand
acting as the authorized agent within 360 days from the date the funds are repatriated to Thailand. You are also required to inform the
authorized agent of the details of the foreign currency transaction, including your identification information and the purpose of the
transaction.
Exhibit 10.38
If you do not comply with the above obligations, you may be subject to penalties assessed by the Bank of Thailand. Because exchange
control regulations change frequently and without notice, you should consult your legal advisor before selling any Shares (or receiving any
other funds in connection with the Plan) to ensure compliance with current regulations. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all
exchange control laws in Thailand, and neither the Company nor your employer will be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from failure
to comply with applicable laws.
TURKEY
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of
the Shares takes place outside of Turkey through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Exchange Control Information.
Under Turkish law, Turkish residents are permitted to purchase and sell securities or derivatives traded on exchanges abroad only through a
financial intermediary licensed in Turkey. Therefore, you may be required to appoint a Turkish broker to assist you with the sale of the Shares
acquired under the Plan. You should consult your personal legal advisor before selling any Shares acquired under the Plan to confirm the
applicability of this requirement to you.
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The Plan is being offered only to employees and is in the nature of providing equity incentives to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). Any documents related to the Plan, including the Plan, this Award
Agreement, and other grant documents (“Plan Documents”), are intended for distribution only to such employees and must not be delivered
to, or relied on by any other person. Prospective purchasers of the securities offered (i.e., the RSUs) should conduct their own due diligence
on the securities.
The Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority has no responsibility for reviewing or verifying any Plan Documents nor has it taken
steps to verify the information set out in them, and thus, is not responsible for such documents. Further, neither the Ministry of Economy nor
the Dubai Department of Economic Development has approved this statement nor taken steps to verify the information set out in it and has
no responsibility for it. If you do not understand the contents of the Plan Documents, you should consult an authorized financial advisor.
UNITED KINGDOM
TERMS & CONDITIONS
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of
this Appendix I:
Exhibit 10.38
Without limitation to the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I,
you agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the
Company or your employer or by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). You
also agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and your employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or
withhold or have paid or will pay on your behalf to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of the Act), the terms of the immediately
foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax due is not collected from or paid
by you within ninety (90) days of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount
of any uncollected tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable.
You acknowledge that you ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to
HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying the Company or your employer (as applicable) for the value of any employee
national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or your employer may obtain from you by any of the
means referred to in the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I.
