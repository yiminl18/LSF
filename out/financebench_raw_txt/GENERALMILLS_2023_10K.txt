ITEM 1 - Business 
COMPANY OVERVIEW
For more than 150 years, General Mills has been making food the world loves. We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of
branded consumer foods with more than 100 brands in 100 countries across six continents. In addition to our consolidated operations,
we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in approximately 130
countries worldwide.
We manage and review the financial results of our business under four operating segments: North America Retail; International; Pet;
and North America Foodservice. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.
We offer a variety of human and pet food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the
world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories:
●snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;
●ready-to-eat cereal;
●convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;
●wholesome natural pet food;
●refrigerated and frozen dough;
●baking mixes and ingredients;
●yogurt; and
●super-premium ice cream.
Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets
outside North America, and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in
Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 of this report.
The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.
Customers
Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount
chains, e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores,
and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution
arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers and certain markets. For further information on our customer
credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During
fiscal 2023, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales
of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further
information on significant customers, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Competition
The human and pet food categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories
are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-
mortar stores and e-commerce. All our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition
in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of
marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer
relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs,
an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products,
but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we
compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.
5Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging
The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, meat, vegetable oils, sugar, vegetables,
fruits, nuts, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic, and metal
packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased
from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may
be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate
change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics,
war, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We believe that we will be able to obtain an
adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business
in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production
needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in
manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs
using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and
more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that
are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global
operations (set forth in italics in this report) includeAnnie’s, Betty Crocker,Bisquick,Blue Buffalo,Blue Basics,Blue Freedom,
Bugles,CascadianFarm,Cheerios,Chex,Cinnamon Toast Crunch,Cocoa Puffs,Cookie Crisp,EPIC,Fiber One,Fruit by the Foot,
Fruit Gushers,Fruit Roll-Ups,Gardetto's,Gold Medal,Golden Grahams,Häagen-Dazs,Kitano,Kix,Lärabar,Latina,Lucky
Charms,Muir Glen,Nature Valley,Nudges, Oatmeal Crisp,Old El Paso,Pillsbury,Progresso,Raisin Nut Bran,Total,Top Chews
Naturals, Totino’s,Trix,True Chews, Wanchai Ferry,Wheaties,Wilderness, andYoki. We protect these trademarks as appropriate
through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long
as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use. 
Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-
standing products (e.g.,Reese’s Puffs for cereal,Green Giantfor vegetables in certain countries, andYoplaitand related brands for
fresh dairy in the United States and Canada), and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party
equities).
Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with theNestlétrademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its
trademarks to CPW, including theNestlé andUncle Toby’s trademarks. TheHäagen-Dazs trademark is licensed royalty-free and
exclusively to Nestlé and authorized sublicensees for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada. 
TheHäagen-Dazs trademark is also licensed to HDJ in Japan. ThePillsbury brand and thePillsbury Doughboy character are subject
to an exclusive, royalty-free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in
the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico. 
We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise,
recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset,
but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
SEASONALITY
In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment
demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for
Progressosoup is higher during the fall and winter months. Within our International segment, demand forHäagen-Dazsice cream is
higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these
demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our International segment’s net sales are
generally evenly balanced throughout the year.
QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION
The manufacture and sale of human and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to
regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal
Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection
Agency, as well as various federal, state, and local agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, marketing, storage,
distribution, quality, and safety of food and pet products and the health and safety of our employees. Our business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United States.
 
6ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
As of May 28, 2023, we were involved with two response actions associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous
substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey. 
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all
similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in
general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or
competitive position.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
Recruiting, developing, engaging, and protecting our workforce is critical to executing our strategy and achieving business success. As
of May 28, 2023, we had approximately 34,000 employees around the globe, with approximately 16,000 in the U.S. and
approximately 18,000 located in our markets outside of the U.S. Our workforce is divided between approximately 13,000 employees
dedicated to the production of our products and approximately 21, 000 non-production employees. 
The efficient production of high-quality products and successful execution of our strategy requires a talented, skilled, and engaged
team of employees. We work to equip our employees with critical skills and expand their contributions over time by providing a range
of training and career development opportunities, including hands-on experiences via challenging work assignments and job rotations,
coaching and mentoring opportunities, and training programs. To foster employee engagement and commitment, we follow a robust
process to listen to employees, take action, and measure our progress with on-going employee conversations, transparent
communications, and employee engagement surveys.
We believe that fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging strengthens our ability to recruit talent and allows all of our employees
to thrive and succeed. We actively cultivate a culture that acknowledges, respects, and values all dimensions of diversity – including
gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, backgrounds, and beliefs. Ensuring diversity of input and perspectives is core to our business
strategy, and we are committed to recruiting, retaining, developing, and advancing a workforce that reflects the diversity of the
consumers we serve. This commitment starts with our company leadership where women represent approximately 47 percent of our
officer and director population, and approximately 22 percent of our officers and directors are racially or ethnically diverse. We
embed our culture of inclusion and belonging into our day-to-day ways of working through a number of programs to foster discussion,
build empathy, and increase understanding.
We are committed to maintaining a safe and secure workplace for our employees. We set specific safety standards to identify and
manage critical risks. We use global safety management systems and employee training to ensure consistent implementation of safety
protocols and accurate measurement and tracking of incidents. To provide a safe and secure working environment for our employees,
we prohibit workplace discrimination, and we do not tolerate abusive conduct or harassment. Our attention to the health and safety of
our workforce extends to the workers and communities in our supply chain. We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to
our strategy and to our commitment to ethical business conduct.

ITEM 1A - Risk Factors
 
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Business and Industry Risks
 
The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we arenot able to compete effectively, our results of
operations could be adverselyaffected.
 
The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are
manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products
through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other
resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional
brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is
based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity,
convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large
competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could
adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected.
Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in
response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain
brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and
private label products.
 
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.
 
There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition,
large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing,
increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased
promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs,
and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In
addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percent
of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant
customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
 
Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,and energy may adversely affect our
profitability.
 
The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as
weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade
tariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental
agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodity
price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable to
increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We
do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as
we intend. 
 
9Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers toavoid certain products or ingredients.
 
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our
products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from
buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,which may result in decreased demand for our
products.
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer
products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may
change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or
react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a
timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer.
Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium,
trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or
attributes.
 
We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories.
 
The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio
by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability
to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and
existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
 
Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our
brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could
diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner,
adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver
consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of
social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and
opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously
damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be
negatively impacted.
Operating Risks
If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as aresult of the highly competitive environment in
which we operate.
 
Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products
in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs
through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our
profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing
facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively
impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our
efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the
anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
 
Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our
manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics,
war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our
ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single
supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital
equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and
 
 
 
10external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our
operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with
significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our
customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate
steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly
when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as
require additional resources to restore our supply chain.
 
Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain
our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.
 
In fiscal 2023, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a
number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:
 
●political and economic instability;
●exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
●tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;
●nationalization or government control of operations;
●compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
●foreign tax treaties and policies; and
●restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.
 
Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations
could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British
pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter
into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be
effective in significantly reducing our exposure.
 
A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our
reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses.
Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.
 
Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information
technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of
business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure
are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain
management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication
among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about
our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent
on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as
catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer
viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security
and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on
those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and
customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts
that may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.
 
From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success
depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions,
our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of
key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with
entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies,
and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.
 
11Legal and Regulatory Risks
If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we mightneed to recall those items and may experience
product liability claims ifconsumers or their pets are injured.
 
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could
result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of
product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product
recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in
our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.
 
Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the
Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign
governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and
the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits,
administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and
could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations.
We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience
to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase
our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with
environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to
a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of
unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and
compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with
environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.
Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business.
There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on
global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change
has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities
that are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities,
disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs. Increasing concern
over climate change or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer
preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues. We may also become subject to
additional legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gas
emission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single-use plastic limits), and disclosure
obligations. If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that
we are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we chose
to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations.
We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress
toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm our
reputation and adversely affect demand for our products.
Financial and Economic Risks
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause
volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
 
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and
corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in
earnings currently, which may result in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we
utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating
 
 
 
12profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting
treatments.
Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
 
The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic
uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases
altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to
lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices
sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that
purchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.
 
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely
affect our ability to pay dividends.
 
As of May 28, 2023, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $12.0 billion. The agreements under which we have issued
indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit
our:
 
●ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if
the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and
●flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general
economic conditions.
 
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply
with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its
stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial
performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our
control.
We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, our
credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overall global capital
markets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital.
 
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefitpension,
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.
 
We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including
defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension
plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest
rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the
funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the
plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of
operations and cash flows from operations.
 
A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of
capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated
results of operations and net worth.
 
As of May 28, 2023, we had $21. 2 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units
is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We
compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair
value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our
long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other
factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic
conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwill
is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.
 
13 
We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with theBlue Buffalo,
Pillsbury,Totino’s,Old El Paso, Progresso,Annie’s,Nudges,andHäagen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-
lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of
obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the
level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
 
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model
using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own
the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and
macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired.
OurProgresso,EPIC, andUncle Toby’s brands had risk of decreasing coverage and we continue to monitor these businesses.

this report.

15ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand
names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and
preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new
products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share
positions in markets around the globe.
Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe
achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash
return to shareholders over time.
Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:
●2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;
●mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;
●mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);
●free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and
●cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.
We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term. 
The strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating,
unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that
have the best prospects for profitable growth, and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and
divestitures to further enhance our growth profile.
In fiscal 2023, we continued to successfully adapt to the dynamic operating environment and deliver strong performance. This
included growth in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of our initial targets. We
achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year: 
We continued to compete effectively, including holding or growing market share in more than 50 percent of our global
priority businesses for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022
and assessing that platform on a 2-year basis. We generated organic net sales growth across each of our four operating
segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of
net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation.
We continued to invest for the future, including a 17 percent increase in media and advertising expense, a double-digit
increase in investment in our digital and technology capability, and a strong increase in capital investment related to new
growth capacity.
We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our
portfolio’s ability to generate profitable growth over the long term.
Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 rose 6 percent to $20,094 million. On an organic basis, net sales increased 10 percent
compared to year-ago levels. Operating profit of $3,434 million was down 1 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $3,457 million
increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $4.31 was down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022 results. Adjusted
diluted EPS of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a
description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).
Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023, representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings,
including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling
$690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2,089 million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including
earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288
million and net share repurchases totaling $1,171 million. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use
of measures not defined by GAAP).
A detailed review of our fiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2023
Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set
forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and
       
     
    
         
 
16Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2022 Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated
herein by reference.
In fiscal 202 4, we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. Our key priorities are
to continue to compete effectively, to improve our supply chain efficiency, and to maintain our disciplined approach to capital
allocation. We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 2024 will be the economic health of consumers, the
moderating rate of input cost inflation, and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net
sales growth in fiscal 2024 through strong marketing, innovation, in-store support, and net price realization generated through our
Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023. For the
full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5 percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primarily by labor inflation
that continues to impact sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics costs. We expect to generate higher levels of Holistic Margin
Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023.
Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2024 targets are summarized below:
●Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent.
●Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $3,457 million reported
in fiscal 2023.
●Adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $4.30 earned in
fiscal 2023.
●Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings.
See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.
FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022 and organic net sales increased 10 percent compared to last year.
Operating profit decreased 1 percent to $3,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume
growth, an unfavorable change to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodities positions and grain inventories, and an
increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses, partially offset
by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 17.1 percent decreased 120 basis points. Adjusted operating
profit of $3, 457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix,
partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase in SG&A expenses, including
increased media and advertising expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings
per share of $4.31 decreased 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a
constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by
GAAP).

Organic net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 10 percent compared to fiscal 2022, driven by favorable organic net price realization and
mix, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from organic volume growth.
Cost of salesincreased $958 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1,454 million increase
attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292 million net
increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023,
compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report for additional information). In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall on certain
internationalHäagen-Dazsice cream products. We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring
initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal
2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).
Gross marginincreased 2 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 110 basis
points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022. 
SG&A expenses increased $353 million to $3,500 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased media
and advertising expenses, unfavorable valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments, an increase in
certain compensation and benefits expenses, and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses as a percent of
net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 80 basis points compared to fiscal 2022.
Divestitures gain, net totaled $445 million in fiscal 2023primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad
side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $194 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS,
Yoplait marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl and our European dough businesses (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).
Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (recoveries)totaled $56 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $26 million of net
recoveries in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain
structure and to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network, and as a result, we recorded $41 million of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal
2022, we approved restructuring actions in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations
and recorded $12 million of charges. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional
information. 
 
 
   
      
   
 
 
 
18Benefit plan non-service incometotaled $89 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an
increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets (please see Note 14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).
Interest, netfor fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $2 million higher than fiscal 2022.
Oureffective tax ratefor fiscal 2023 was 19.5 percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022. The 1.2 percentage point increase was
primarily driven by a change in the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward s in fiscal 2022, partially offset by certain
favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023 . Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in
fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 0.5
percentage point decrease was primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023.
After-tax earnings from joint venturesdecreased to $81 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily
driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix at
CPW. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 18 percent (see the “Non-GAAP Measures”
section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth

Net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests decreased to $16 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $28
million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl in
fiscal 2022.
Average diluted shares outstandingdecreased by 11 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily due to share repurchases,
partially offset by option exercises. 
RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS
Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice .
In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment
and segment operating profit to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported
consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.

volume growth.
Segment operating profit increased 14 percent to $290 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $256 million in fiscal 2022, primarily
driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in SG&A expenses. Segment
operating profit increased 14 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP
Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).
UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives,
certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project-related costs, gains and losses on corporate investments, and other
items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the
revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until
passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are
excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our
manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency
and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by
operating segment.
Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292 million
net increase in expense related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023,
compared to a $133 million net decrease in expense last year. We recorded $84 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments
and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a
$22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain internationalHäagen-Dazs ice cream products. In addition, we recorded
$6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration
costs related to our acquisition of Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we recorded $73 million of
transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale
of our European dough businesses. In addition, we recorded a $22 million recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item and a $13
million insurance recovery in fiscal 2022. In addition, certain compensation and benefits expenses and charitable contributions
increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.
IMPACT OF INFLATION
We experienced broad based global input cost inflation of 13 percent in fiscal 2023 and 8 percent in fiscal 2022. We expect
approximately 5 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2024. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, SRM,
planning, and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated
$6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. We typically use a
 
    
 
   
 
 
  
    
 
 
       
    
    
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
24combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant
acquisitions. 
As of May 28, 2023, we had $381 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating
funds from foreign jurisdictions, we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings, as applicable. We may
repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax
liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

During fiscal 2023, cash provided by operations was $2,779 million compared to $3,316 million in the same period last year. The
$538 million decrease was primarily driven by a $326 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $250 million change in net
divestitures gain. The $326 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in
inventories and a $257 million change in accounts payable, partially offset by a $125 million change in the timing of accounts
receivable.
We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2023, core working capital net
liability decreased 20 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 6 percent. The core working capital net liability decreased $84
million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability
decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023.

will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
26Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of
May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

the most recent mark -to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests is
the sum of three -month Term SOFR plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated
agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.
We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid
preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital
account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to
calculate EPS in that period.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this report. Our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and
results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets,
stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans .
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion,
consumer coupon redemption, and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable
product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and
performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction
price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were
$394 million as of May 28, 2023, and $420 million as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are
inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
We estimate the useful lives of long -lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable.
Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.
Intangible Assets 
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill
impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to
determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market
comparables, and other factors. 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our
brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan,
assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. 
 
         
        
        
 
27As of May 28, 2023, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair
value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value, and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially
different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in
material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2023 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first
day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair
values were substantially in excess of the carrying value, except forUncle Toby’sband intangible asset. In addition, while having
significant coverage as of our fiscal 2023 assessment date, theProgressoandEPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing
coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.
Stock-based Compensation 
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to
have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility,
employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as
follows:
Fiscal Year
2023 2022 2021
Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 14.16 $ 8.77 $ 8.03
Assumptions:
Risk-free interest rate 3.3 % 1.5 % 0.7 %
Expected term 8.5years 8.5years 8.5years
Expected volatility 20.9 % 20.2 % 19.5 %
Dividend yield 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.3 %
The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant
date fair value by less than 1 percent . If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023
volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent.
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to
final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between
actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-
over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual
impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and
the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously
determined for financial reporting purposes.
Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that
significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. 
Income Taxes
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For
more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain
circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States,
Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.
         
        
        
        
 
28We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives.
Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our
obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net
periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the
interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.
Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plan assets were a 5.7 percent loss in the 1-year period ended May 28, 2023 and returns of 3.4 percent, 5.9
percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended May 28, 2023.
On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.70 percent for fiscal 2023, 5.85 percent for
fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets
for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due to higher prospective
long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments.
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement
expense by $62 million for fiscal 2024. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-
related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment
gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and
the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our
determination of annual expense or income.
Discount Rates
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of
expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest
rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future
cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.
Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:
Defined Benefit
Pension PlansOther
Postretirement
Benefit PlansPostemployment
Benefit Plans
Effective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs 5.27% 5.15% 5.00%
Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs 5.06% 4.96% 4.61%
Obligations as of May 31, 2023 5.18% 5.19% 4.55%
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs 4.57% 4.41% 3.69%
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs 4.03% 3.80% 3.35%
Obligations as of May 31, 2022 4.39% 4.36% 3.62%
Effective rate for fiscal 2022 service costs 3.53% 3.34% 2.46%
Effective rate for fiscal 2022 interest costs 2.42% 2.08% 1.48%
Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses
are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average
remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants. 
 
 
29Health Care Cost Trend Rates 
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to
remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption
is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down
annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations
only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to
approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed
trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.
Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once
recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight -line method over the average remaining service period of active
plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all”
inactive participants.
Financial Statement Impact 
In fiscal 2023, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of
$6 million compared to $26 million of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had
cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial
net gains of $189 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from
lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement
benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.
Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will
depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related
to the populations participating in these plans.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of
time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to
existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference
rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied
through December 31, 2024. We have reviewed and modified certain contracts, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate,
primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
position. We will continue to review our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the
transition period. 
In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier
financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during
the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requirements
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirement and the
first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the key terms
of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial
statements and related disclosures.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures
provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors. 
For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP
measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful
information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP
measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates
We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to
our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive
compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide
transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as
well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these
measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and
Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.
 
         
    
    
    
    
           
 
     
 
31Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate
This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our
performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is
the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Additionally, the
measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on
year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:

Constant-currency Segment Operating Profit Growth Rates
Webelieve that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of
our segments by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given
volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures
Our fiscal 202 4 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, and free cash
flow conversion are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability,
including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition
transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark-to-market effects. We are not able to reconcile these forward-
looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without
unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign
     
    
 
37currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions
throughout fiscal 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 GAAP financial results. 
For fiscal 2024, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge
positions) and acquisitions and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one
percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million. 
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices.
Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively
manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that
place controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit
limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For
information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
VALUE AT RISK
The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions.A
Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal
market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.
The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to
estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data
set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging
instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of
our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions
included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and
options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related
positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments. 
The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign
currency, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 28, 2023.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
General Mills, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable
interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2023, and the related notes and financial
statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria established inInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended May 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria
established inInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
41Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of goodwill and brand intangible assets
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill and brands and other indefinite-lived intangibles
balances as of May 28, 2023, were $14,511.2 million and $6,712.4 million, respectively. The impairment tests for these
assets, which are performed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have
occurred, require the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned as well as the
brands and other indefinite -lived intangible assets. The fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow analyses
that require the Company to make judgments about highly subjective matters, including future operating results, including
revenue growth rates and operating margins, and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates.
We identified the assessment of the valuation of certain goodwill and brand intangible assets as a critical audit matter. There
was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward-looking
assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates and operating margins, royalty rates and
subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the valuation of goodwill and brand intangible assets. This
included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure
the fair value of the reporting units and brands intangible assets. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth
rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential
assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent
financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted
in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed
using publicly available market data for comparable entities and the royalty rates by evaluating the methods, assumptions and
market data used to estimate the royalty rates.

47Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS
Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling
financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those
transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Our India business is on an April fiscal year end.
Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period
presentation. 
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories 
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or
market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with
all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.
Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net
realizable value.
Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales and are recognized
when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.
Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation 
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded
at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are
charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually
depreciated over3 to10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or
retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are
recognized in earnings. 
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash
flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the
excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or
independent appraisals, as appropriate.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as
of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare
the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and
liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among
reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of
goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth
rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates,
perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results
48in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from4 to30 years.
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with theBlue Buffalo, Pillsbury,Totino’s,Old El
Paso,Progresso, Annie’s,Nudges, andHäagen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a
discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that
could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. 
Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would
be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow
model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate. 
Leases
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components,
we account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices. 
Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we
recognize lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our lease arrangements provide
us with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. We include these options when we are
reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, our lease
agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.
We have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen-Dazs retail shops often
include rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically
based on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not
included as minimum lease payments used to determine our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Variable rental payments are
recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. 
As most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply an incremental borrowing rate based on the
information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of
undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research
and development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we
make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished
goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.
In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including,
but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of
capital, or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and
profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their
nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than
the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the
investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.
Revenue Recognition 
Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation
– the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation
has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by
our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and
consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the
transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added,
and other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated
participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to
the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return.
49However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances,
product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear
interest. Payment terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have
any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to
our trade receivables. We pool our trade receivables based on similar risk characteristics, such as geographic location, business
channel, and other account data. To estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, asset-
specific risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are
written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 17 for a disaggregation of our revenue
into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic
factors. We do not have material contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers.
Environmental Costs 
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.
Advertising Production Costs 
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.
Research and Development 
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures
for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries,
wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities,
including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.
Foreign Currency Translation 
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are
translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on
investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on
instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.
Derivative Instruments 
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their
fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of
derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective
as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are
reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any
associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. 
Stock-based Compensation 
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share
of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally,
stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in
selling, general , and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to
each reportable segment in our segment results.
Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of
eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s or director’s retention of the
award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized
immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement
eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.
We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans 
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired
employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in
the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.
Use of Estimates 
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based
compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual
results could differ from our estimates.
New Accounting Standards 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021,we adopted new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial
instruments, including trade receivables. The new standard and subsequent amendments replace the incurred loss impairment model
with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Our allowance
for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to our trade receivables. We pool our trade receivables
based on similar risk characteristics, such as geographic location, business channel, and other account data. To estimate our allowance
for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, asset-specific risk characteristics, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the
amount is uncollectible. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments using the modified
retrospective transition approach, and recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $5.7 million after-tax. 
NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust, a manufacturer of high-quality frozen pizza crusts for regional and
national pizza chains, foodservice distributors, and retail outlets, for a purchase price of $253.0 million. We financed the transaction
with U.S. commercial paper. We consolidated the TNT Crust business into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of
$156.8 million. The goodwill is included in the North America Foodservice segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The pro
forma effects of this acquisition were not material. We have conducted a preliminary assessment of the fair value of the acquired
assets and liabilities of the TNT Crust business and will continue to review these items during the measurement period. If new
information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised to
reflect the resulting adjustments to current estimates of these items. The consolidated results of the TNT Crust business are reported in
our North America Foodservice segment on a one-month lag. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business to
Eagle Family Foods Group for $606.8 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $442.2 million. 
In fiscal 2022, we sold our European dough businesses and recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $30.4 million. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl to
Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in exchange for Sodiaal’s interest in our Canadian yogurt business, a modified agreement for the use of
Yoplait andLibertébrands in the United States and Canada, and cash. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of $163.7 million on the sale of
these businesses.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business for $1.2 billion in cash. We financed the
transaction with a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt. We consolidated Tyson Foods’ pet treats business into our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $762.3 million, indefinite-lived intangible assets for theNudges,Top
Chews, andTrue Chews brands totaling $330.0 million in aggregate, and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of $40.0 million.
The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not
material. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $53.5 million related to the sale of our Laticínios Carolina
business in Brazil.
     
   
 
 
 
     
     
 
     
   
 
 
51NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS 
We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets and are evaluated against internal rate of
return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each
major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination
fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our
disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or
updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan.
Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.
Restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2023 were as follows:
Expense, in Millions
Global supply chain actions $ 36.2
Network optimization actions 6.4
Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 18.4
Total restructuring charges $ 61.0
In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure. We expect to incur
approximately $52 million of restructuring charges and project-related costs related to these actions, of which approximately $35
million will be cash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $26 million of severance and $26 million of other costs,
primarily $8 million of asset impairment and $11 million of other asset write-offs. We recognized $25.8 million of severance and
$10.4 million of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025.
In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions in our International segment to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network. We expect
to incur approximately $10 million of restructuring charges and project-related costs related to these actions, of which approximately
$9 million will be cash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $6 million of severance and $4 million of other costs.
We recognized $5.6 million of severance and $0.8 million of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect these actions to be completed by
theend of fiscal 2024. 
Certain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required.
We paid net $36.6 million of cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2023. We paid net $93.9 million of cash in fiscal 2022.

Our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test was performed on the first day of the second quarter of
fiscal 2023, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in
excess of the carrying values, except for theUncle Toby’s brand intangible asset. In addition, while having significant coverage as of
our fiscal 2023 assessment date, theProgresso andEPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to
monitor these businesses for potential impairment.
We did not identify any indicators of impairment for any goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 28, 2023.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates
and commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and
swaps) pursuant to our established policies.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives
to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean),
dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty
with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a
combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options
and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as
close as possible to or below our planned cost.
Weuse derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve
hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded
currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our
objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of
measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment
operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from
unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the
derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items. 
Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 included:
Fiscal Year
In Millions 2023 2022 2021
Net (loss) gain on mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions $ (154.4)$ 303.3$ 138.2
Net gain on commodity positions reclassified from unallocated corporate
 items to segment operating profit (89.5) (188.0) (8.8)
Net mark-to-market revaluation of certain grain inventories (48.0) 17.8 9.4
Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions recognized in
 unallocated corporate items $ (291.9)$ 133.1$ 138.8
   
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
57As of May 28, 2023, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $406.8 million, of which $257.9 million related to
agricultural inputs and $148.9 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the
next12 months. 
INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of
floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, SOFR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and
Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate
changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt,
based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the
difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.
Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of
forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or
changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified
into earnings over the life of the associated debt. 
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness
assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently
available on loans with similar terms and maturities. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into €750.0 million of forward-starting
swaps. The forward-starting swap agreements were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the
Company’s issuance of a €750.0 million6-year fixed-rate note. Upon termination, a loss of $5.0 million was recognized in AOCI and
will be amortized through interest expense over the respective term of the debt. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks. The
treasury locks were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the Company’s issuance of a $1,000.0
million10-year fixed-rate note. Upon termination, a loss of $1.4 million was recognized in AOCI and will be amortized through
interest expense over the respective term of the debt. 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a $500.0 million notional amount interest swap to convert our $500.0 million
fixed rate notes dueNovember 18, 2025, to a floating rate. 
As of May 28, 2023, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified
to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:
In Millions Gain/(Loss)

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party
purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign
currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling,
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward
contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial
paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with
foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in
earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.
As of May 28, 2023, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $933.0 million.
We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We hedged a portion of these net investments by
issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 28, 2023, we hedged a portion of
these net investments with €2,949.9 million of euro denominated bonds. As of May 28, 2023, we had deferred net foreign currency
transaction gains of $71.9 million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred
compensation plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 28, 2023, the net notional amount of our equity
swaps was $177.5 million. In fiscal 2024, $165.4 million of swap contracts will mature, and $12.1 million of swap contracts mature in
fiscal 2025.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from
each of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative
instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May 28, 2023, was $100.1
million. We have posted $60.5 million of collateral under these contracts. 
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK
During fiscal 2023, customer concentration was as follows:
Percent of total ConsolidatedNorth America
RetailNorth America
FoodserviceInternational Pet
Walmart (a):
Net sales 21% 28% 8% 2% 16%
Accounts receivable 22% 8% 3% 15%
Five largest customers:

(a) Includes Walmart Inc. and its affiliates.
No customer other than Walmart accounted for10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales.
We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of
highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy,
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of
nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures
transactions through various regulated exchanges.
  
      
      
 
    
    
 
63The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the
contracts, is $4.5 million. We haveno collateral held against these contracts. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our
transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and
counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may
access if the counterparty defaults.
We offer certain suppliers access to third-party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The third-party
services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party.
We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties, or any
financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our
supplier agreements. As of May 28, 2023, $1,430.1 million of our accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-
party services. As of May 29, 2022, $1,429.6 million of our accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-party
services.

66NOTE 10. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
Our principal noncontrolling interest relates to our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiar y.
The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application
of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation
(currently $251.5 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests is the sum of thethree-month Term SOFR
plus186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted everythree years through a negotiated agreement with the ClassAInterest
holder or through a remarketing auction.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté
Marques Sàrl to Sodiaal in exchange for Sodiaal’s interest in our Canadian yogurt business, a modified agreement for the use of
Yoplait andLibertébrands in the United States and Canada, and cash. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Up to the date of the divestiture, Sodiaal held the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the
fair value of Sodiaal’s49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Sodiaal had the right to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value until the divestiture closed in the third
quarter of fiscal 2022. In connection with the divestiture, cumulative adjustments made to the redeemable interest related to the fair
value put feature were reversed against additional paid-in capital, where changes in the redemption amount were historically recorded,
and the resulting carrying value of the noncontrolling interests were included in the calculation of the gain on divestiture.
We paid dividends of $105.1 million in fiscal 2022 and $40.3 million in fiscal 2021 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS,
Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements.
A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS had an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal through November 28,
2021. Net purchases totaled $99.5 million for the six-month period ended November 28, 2021.
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned consolidated
subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these
subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. 
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.
NOTE 11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Cumulative preference stock of5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.
On June 27, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under

NOTE 12. STOCK PLANS
We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 28,
2023, a total of35.1 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
shares of unrestricted stock under the 2022 Stock Compensation Plan (2022 Plan). The 2022 Plan also provides for the issuance of
cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding
include some granted under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans
provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors. 
 
         
        
        
 
 
         
 
         
    
         
 
 
69Stock Options
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as
follows:
Fiscal Year
2023 2022 2021
Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 14.16 $ 8.77 $ 8.03
Assumptions:
Risk-free interest rate 3.3 % 1.5 % 0.7 %
Expected term 8.5years 8.5years 8.5years
Expected volatility 20.9 % 20.2 % 19.5 %
Dividend yield 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.3 %
We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make
predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We
estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of
volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did
not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than
6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.
Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to
estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical
exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all
employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based
on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized
windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2022 Plan. As of May 28, 2023, there wereno
stock-based awards granted under the 2022 Plan. Under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan, restricted stock and restricted stock units
generally vest and become unrestrictedfour years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our
future achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative operating cash flow and a relative total
shareholder return modifier. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to athree-year
performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of these awards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding
restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of
common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if the
awards vest.

NOTE 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.
We madeno voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. We do not expect to be required to make
any contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2024. Our principal U.S. retirement plan covering salaried employees has a
provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated withinfive years of a change
in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined
benefit pension plan. 
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The U.S.
salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We madeno voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2023
or fiscal 2022. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 2024.
In fiscal 2021, we approved amendments to reorganize certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit plans. The General Mills Retiree
Health Plan for Union Employees was divided into two plans, with participants under age 65 remaining within its coverage, and
participants age 65 and over covered by The General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+). Effective January 1, 2022,
the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+) allows certain participants to purchase individual health insurance
policies on a private health care exchange. Additionally, the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills was merged into the General
Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees. Separate benefit structures and plan provisions continue to apply to eligible
participants of these merged plans. A portion of the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees overfunded plan assets
were segregated to offset the cost of the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills health and welfare benefits. The segregation of
assets is reported as a negative employer contribution in the change in other postretirement benefit plan assets. The amendments
facilitate targeted investment strategies that reflect each plan’s unique liability characteristics.
 
    
  
 
72In fiscal 2021, we announced changes to the design of our health care coverage for certain eligible retirees to allow participants to
purchase individual health insurance policies on a private health care exchange effective January 1, 2022. These changes provide
certain eligible retirees with greater flexibility in choosing health care coverage that best fits their needs.
Health Care Cost Trend Rates 
Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:
Fiscal Year
2023 2022
Health care cost trend rate for next year 6.6% and6.6% 5.9% and6.0%
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate) 4.5% 4.5%
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2032 2031
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to
remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption
is6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until
the ultimate trend rate of4.5 percent is reached in2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the
retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate
the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for
health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.
Postemployment Benefit Plans 
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United
States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

Discount Rates
Weestimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension,
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our
outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above
Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This
forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

There wereno transfers into or out of level 3 investments in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2022, the inclusion of non-observable inputs
into the pricing of certain private equity securities resulted in the transfer of $66.3 million into level 3 investments.
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to
participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The
defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset
classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit
pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is:9 percent to equities in the United States;6 percent to international
equities;7 percent to private equities;68 percent to fixed income; and10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure).
For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are:28 percent to equities in the United States;
14 percent to international equities;14 percent to total private equities; and44 percent to fixed income. The actual allocations to these
asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.
Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We donot expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2024. Actual fiscal 2024 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by
our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2033 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans 
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union
employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net
assets of $19.2 million as of May 28, 2023, and $20.6 million as of May 29, 2022. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many
of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $97.2 million in fiscal 2023,
$90.1 million in fiscal 2022, and $76.1 million in fiscal 2021.
We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment
options of the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was3.7
million as of May 28, 2023, and4.0 million as of May 29, 2022. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash
balances.
The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $498.7 million and $443.8 million of Company common stock as of May 28,
2023, and May 29, 2022, respectively.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence
does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain
income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA introduces a Corporate Alternative Minimum
Tax beginning in our fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock starting after January 1, 2023. We do not
currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our
liquidity. The amount of excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock was immaterial in fiscal 2023. We will continue to monitor
and assess the impact the IRA may have on our business and financial results.
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was signed into law. The ARPA includes a provision expanding the
limitations on the deductibility of certain executive employee compensation beginning in our fiscal 2028. We do not currently expect
the ARPA to have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our liquidity. 
As of May 28, 2023, we havenot recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our
foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings
will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these
reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no
longer indefinitely reinvested. All earnings prior to fiscal 2018 remain permanently reinvested. Earnings from fiscal 2018 and later are
not permanently reinvested and local country withholding taxes are recorded on earnings each year. 
We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years
may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the
timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely
outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any
particular position would usually require the use of cash.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdiction is the United States
(federal and state). Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which
vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from3 to5 years.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing our federal tax returns for fiscal2018 and 2019. Several state and foreign
examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results of operations
or financial position. We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.
The Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), has concluded audits of our 2012 through 2018 tax return
years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki
Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this
transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to continue to contest the disallowance for all years.
 
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.
 
       
    
    
    
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
81The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2023
and fiscal 2022. Approximately $90 million of this total in fiscal 2023 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our
effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because
certain portions of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal
income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 28, 2023, we donot expect to pay unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months. We
are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
outcomes. Our unrecognized tax benefit liability was classified in other liabilities.
We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2023, we
recognized $4.7 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $32.4 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 28,
2023. For fiscal 2022, we recognized $2.0 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $26.6 million of accrued interest
and penalties as of May 29, 2022.
NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
As of May 28, 2023, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $149.9 million for the debt and other obligations of non-
consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. Off-balance sheet arrangements were not material as of May 28, 2023.
During fiscal 2020, we received notice from the tax authorities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil regarding our compliance with its
state sales tax requirements. As a result, we have been assessed additional state sales taxes, interest, and penalties. We believe that we
have meritorious defenses against this claim and will vigorously defend our position. As ofMay 28, 2023, we are unable to estimate
any possible loss and have not recorded a loss contingency for this matter.
NOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
We operate in the packaged foods industry. In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global
operations. This global reorganization required us to reevaluate our operating segments. Under our new organization structure, our
chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about resources to be allocated to our operating segments as
follows: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice. 
Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership
stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, convenience stores, and e-commerce grocery providers. Our product
categories in this business segment include ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough
products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, snack bars, fruit snacks, savory snacks, and a wide variety of
organic products including ready-to-eat cereal, frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, meal kits, fruit snacks and snack bars.
Our International operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States and Canada. Our
product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, salty snacks, snack bars, dessert and baking mixes,
and shelf stable vegetables. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail
shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin
American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are
reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.
Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States and Canada in national pet superstore chains,
e-commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
     
     
 
   
     
     
 
      
     
 
 
 
         
     
         
 
82categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, vegetables and other high-quality
natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions, and textures and cuts for wet foods.
Our North America Foodservice segment consists of foodservice businesses in the United States and Canada. Our major product
categories in our North America Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals,
unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and bakery flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer
and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice,
vending, and supermarket bakeries.
Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment,
and other exit costs. Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned North American
employee benefits and incentives, certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project-related costs, gains and losses on
corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains
and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain
commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the
corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply
chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order
to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained
nor available by operating segment.

Adjusted diluted EPS. Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability. 
Adjusted operating profit. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.
Adjusted operating profit margin. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability, divided by net
sales.
Constant currency. Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the
rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in
currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the
corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.
Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average
foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.
Derivatives. Financial instruments such as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from
changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The calculation of earnings before income taxes and
after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, depreciation and amortization.
Euribor. European Interbank Offered Rate.
Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on
the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3
generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets .
Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
Free cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of land, buildings, and equipment .
Free cash flow conversion rate. Free cash flow divided by our net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and
noncontrolling interests adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are required to use in recording
and reporting accounting information in our financial statements.
Goodwill. The difference between the purchase price of acquired companies plus the fair value of any redeemable and noncontrolling
interests and the related fair values of net assets acquired.
Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales. 
Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding
changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for certain hedging instruments and hedged
items only if the hedging relationship is highly effective, and only prospectively from the date a hedging relationship is formally
documented.
Holistic Margin Management (HMM). Company-wide initiative to use productivity savings, mix management, and price realization
to offset input cost inflation, protect margins , and generate funds to reinvest in sales-generating activities.
 
 
 
88Interest bearing instruments. Notes payable, long-term debt, including current portion, cash and cash equivalents, and certain
interest bearing investments classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.
LIBOR. London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Mark-to-market. The act of determining a value for financial instruments, commodity contracts, and related assets or liabilities based
on the current market price for that item.
Net debt. Long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. 
Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts
that will be allocated to segment operating profit when the exposure we are hedging affects earnings.
Net price realization. The impact of list and promoted price changes, net of trade and other price promotion costs.
Net realizable value.The estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation.
Noncontrolling interests. Interests of consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. 
Notional principal amount. The principal amount on which fixed-rate or floating-rate interest payments are calculated .
OCI. Other comprehensive income (loss). 
Operating cash flow conversion rate. Net cash provided by operating activities, divided by net earnings, including earnings
attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests.
Operating cash flow to net debt ratio. Net debt divided by cash provided by operating activities.

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal control system was designed to

published financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as

the Treadway Commission (COSO) inInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO inInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 28, 2023.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
 The following description of our Common Stock and our cumulative preference stock is a summary and does not purport to
be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of
Incorporation”) and our By-laws, as amended (the “By-laws”), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-laws and the applicable
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) for additional information.
 General
 Our Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of one billion shares of our Common stock, par value $0.10
per share, and five million shares of cumulative preference stock, without par value, issuable in series. Our Common Stock is listed
and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GIS.” All outstanding shares of our Common Stock are
fully paid and nonassessable. 
Dividend Rights
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors out of funds
legally available for that purpose, provided that if any shares of preference stock are at the time outstanding, the payment of dividends
on Common Stock or other distributions (including purchases of Common Stock) may be subject to the declaration and payment of
full cumulative dividends, and the absence of overdue amounts in any mandatory sinking fund, on outstanding shares of preference
stock.
Voting Rights
 The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including the
election of directors, subject to the voting rights of any preference stock then outstanding. The holders of Common Stock are not
entitled to cumulative voting of their shares in the election of directors. Directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast by
the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy, provided that if the number of nominees
standing for election at any meeting of the stockholders exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors will be elected by
a plurality of the votes cast. Except as provided by law, all other matters are to be decided by a vote of a majority of votes cast by the
holders of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably
in any assets remaining after the satisfaction in full of the prior rights of creditors, including holders of our indebtedness, and the
aggregate liquidation preference of any preference stock then outstanding.
Other Rights and Preferences
The holders of Common Stock do not have any conversion rights or any preemptive rights to subscribe for stock or any other
securities of the Company. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Common Stock. 
Effect of Preference Shares
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to approve the issuance of one or more series of preference stock without further
authorization of our stockholders and to fix the number of shares, the designations, the relative rights and the limitations of any series
of preference stock. As a result, our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, could authorize the issuance of preference stock
with voting, conversion and other rights that could proportionately reduce, minimize or otherwise adversely affect the voting power
and other rights of holders of Common Stock or other series of preference stock or that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in our control.
Transfer Agent
The transfer agent for Common Stock is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC.

amount of our 2026 Notes on January 15, 2020, €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes on November 16, 2021,
and, €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes on April 13, 2023. The 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and
2029 Notes are listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “GIS 25A,” “GIS 26,” “GIS 27,”
and “GIS 29,” respectively. As of May 28, 2023, €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, €600,000,000
aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes, €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes and €750,000,000
aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes were outstanding.
 The Notes were each issued as a separate series of securities under the Indenture. The Notes and the Indenture are governed
by, and are to be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed
wholly within the State of New York.
 Interest and Maturity
 The 2025 Notes will mature on November 15, 2025, the 2026 Notes will mature on January 15, 2026, the 2027 Notes will
mature on April 27, 2027, and the 2029 Notes will mature on April 13, 2029. We will pay interest on the 2025 Notes at the rate of
0.125% per year annually in arrears on November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2022, to holders of record on the
preceding November 1. We will pay interest on the 2026 Notes at the rate of 0.450% per year annually in arrears on January 15 of
each year, beginning January 15, 2021, to holders of record on the preceding January 1. We will pay interest on the 2027 Notes at the
rate of 1.500% per year annually in arrears on April 27 of each year, beginning April 27, 2016, to holders of record on the preceding
April 12. We will pay interest on the 2029 Notes at the rate of 3.907% per year annually in arrears on April 13 of each year, beginning
April 13, 2024, to holders of record on the preceding April 1. Interest payments for the 2025 Notes include accrued interest from and
including November 16, 2021 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case
may be, to but excluding the interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payments for the 2026 Notes
include accrued interest from and including January 15, 2020 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been
paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest
payments for the 2027 Notes include accrued interest from and including April 27, 2015, or from and including the last date in respect
of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the next interest payment date or the date of
maturity, as the case may be. Interest payments for the 2029 Notes include accrued interest from and including April 13, 2023 or from
and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the next
interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payable at the maturity of the Notes will be payable to the
registered holders of the Notes to whom the principal is payable.
 Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated
and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes, to but excluding the next
scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of
the International Capital Market Association. If any interest payment date on the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the
interest payment will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, and no interest on that payment will accrue for the period
from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of
interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period
from and after the maturity date.
 “Business day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions are
authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European
Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates.
 Payments in Euro
 All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, is payable in euro. If the
euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no
longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the
settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the
Notes will be made in dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro is converted
into dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in
dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture governing the Notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying
agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.
 Issuance of Additional Notes
 We may, without the consent of the holders of Notes, issue additional Notes having the same ranking and the same interest
rate, maturity and other terms as a series of the Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and, in some cases, the first
interest payment date). Any additional Notes, together with the Notes with the same terms, will constitute a single series of Notes
under the Indenture; provided that, if the additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes in this offering for United States federal
income tax purposes, the additional Notes will have different ISIN and CUSIP numbers. No additional Notes of a series may be issued
if an event of default has occurred with respect to that series of Notes.
 Ranking
  The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes rank equal in priority with all of our existing and
future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated
indebtedness. The Notes effectively rank junior to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, because the Notes are only our obligation and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries,
creditors of each of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries, generally will have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. The
Notes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries, and to claims of
owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries. 
 Redemption
 As discussed below, we may redeem the Notes before they mature. The Notes to be redeemed will stop bearing interest on
the redemption date. We will give holders of 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes between 15 and 45 days’ notice before the
redemption date. We will give holders of 2029 Notes between 15 and 60 days’ notice before the redemption date.
 We are not required (i) to register, transfer or exchange the Notes during the period from the opening of business 15 days
before the day a notice of redemption relating to the Notes selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that
notice is sent, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any
Notes being redeemed in part.
 We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. The redemption price for the 2025 Notes to
be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to October 15, 2025 will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount
of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present
values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2025 notes to be redeemed that would be due if the notes
matured on October 15, 2025 (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to
the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as
defined below) plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for
the 2025 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after October 15, 2025 will be equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the 2025 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 Notes to the date of
redemption. The redemption price for the 2026 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to October 15, 2025 will be
equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent
investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the
notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the
redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined
below) plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the
2026 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after October 15, 2025 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the date of redemption. The
redemption price for the 2027 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2027 will be equal to the
greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent investment
bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2027 Notes to
be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption
date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate plus 25 basis points,
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2027 Notes to be redeemed on
any redemption date that is on or after January 27, 2027 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes being
redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2027 Notes to the date of redemption. The redemption price
for the 2029 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 13, 2029 will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of
the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us, the
sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2029 Notes to be redeemed that would
be due if the notes matured on January 13, 2029 (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of
redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable
Government Bond Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption
price for the 2029 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after January 13, 2029 will be equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the 2029 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2029 Notes to the
date of redemption. In any case, the principal amount of a Notes remaining outstanding after a redemption in part shall be €100,000 or
an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.
 In connection with such optional redemption of Notes, the following defined terms apply:
 ●“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal
places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the
Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government
Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected
by us.
●“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion
of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of
the Notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in
issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of,
and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.
 The Notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any of
these special tax events occur, the Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. See “Redemption for Tax Reasons.”
 Payment of Additional Amounts
 We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional
amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder of the Notes (or the
beneficial owner for whose benefit such holder holds the Notes) who is not a United States person (as defined below), after
withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a
taxing authority in the United States, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable; provided,
however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:
(1) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner
for whose benefit such holder holds such note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is
an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being
considered as:
(a) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a
permanent establishment in the United States;
(b) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a
result of the ownership of the Notes or the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights thereunder), including being or

foreign corporation for United States income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States
federal income tax;

in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
(2) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary,
partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the holder, a beneficiary or
settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have
been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its
beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the
holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is
required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by an applicable income tax treaty to which
the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 (4) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or an
applicable paying or withholding agent from the payment;
(5) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a change in law,
regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is
duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

assessment or other governmental charge;
(7) with respect to the 2027 Notes, to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and
that is required to be made pursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any European
Union Directive on the taxation of savings;
(8) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment
of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
(9) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by
the holder of any note, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment
became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(10) with respect to the 2027 Notes, to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld
solely by reason of the beneficial owner being a bank (i) purchasing the Notes in the ordinary course of its lending business or (ii) that
is neither (A) buying the Notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Notes for resale to a third-party that either is not a
bank or holding the Notes for investment purposes only;
(11) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any
amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into
pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any
intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code; or
(12) in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).
 The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation
applicable to the Notes. Except as specifically provided under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to
make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or
taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
 As used under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “Redemption for Tax Reasons”, the
term “United States” means the United States of America, the states of the United States, and the District of Columbia, and the term
“United States person” means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax
purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the
United States or the District of Columbia, or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation
regardless of its source.
 With respect to the 2027 Notes, to the extent permitted by law, we will maintain a paying agent in a Member State of the
European Union (if any) that will not require withholding or deduction of tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on
the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such European
Council Directive.
 Redemption for Tax Reasons
 If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the
United States (or any taxing authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the
application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, we become or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel
selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described under the heading “Payment of Additional Amounts”
with respect to the Notes, then we may at any time at our option redeem, in whole, but not in part, any series of the Notes on not less
than 15 nor more than 45 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and
unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.
  Change of Control Offer to Purchase
 If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of Notes may require us to repurchase all or any part (equal to an
integral multiple of €1,000) of their Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on such Notes to the date of purchase (unless a notice of redemption has been mailed within 30 days after such change of control
triggering event stating that all of the Notes of such series will be redeemed as described above); provided that the principal amount of
a Note remaining outstanding after a repurchase in part shall be €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. We are
required to mail to holders of the Notes a notice describing the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control triggering
event and offering to repurchase the Notes. The notice must be mailed within 30 days after any change of control triggering event, and
the repurchase must occur no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date the notice is mailed.
 On the date specified for repurchase of the Notes, we will, to the extent lawful:
●accept for payment all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes;
●deposit with the paying agent the required payment for all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes; and
●deliver to the trustee the repurchased Notes, accompanied by an officers’ certificate stating, among other things, the
aggregate principal amount of repurchased Notes.
 We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other
securities laws and regulations applicable to the repurchase of the Notes. To the extent that these requirements conflict with the
provisions requiring repurchase of the Notes, we will comply with these requirements instead of the repurchase provisions and will not
be considered to have breached our obligations with respect to repurchasing the Notes. Additionally, if an event of default exists under
the Indenture (which is unrelated to the repurchase provisions of the Notes), including events of default arising with respect to other
issues of debt securities, we will not be required to repurchase the Notes notwithstanding these repurchase provisions.
 We will not be required to comply with the obligations relating to repurchasing the Notes if a third party instead satisfies
them.
 For purposes of the repurchase provisions of the Notes, the following terms are applicable:
 “Change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the consummation of any transaction (including,
without limitation, any merger or consolidation) resulting in any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (other than us or one of our subsidiaries) becoming the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-
3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our voting stock or
other voting stock into which our voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather
than number of shares; (b) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or
consolidation), in a transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more “persons” (as that term is defined in the Indenture) (other than us or one of our
subsidiaries); or (c) the first day on which a majority of the members of our Board of Directors are not continuing directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a change of control if (a) we become a direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b)(y) immediately following that transaction, the direct or indirect holders of the
voting stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the holders of our voting stock immediately prior to that transaction
or (z) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting
stock of the holding company.
 “Change of control triggering event” means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
 “Continuing directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of our Board of Directors who (a) was a member
of the Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (b) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of
Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such
nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of our proxy statement in which such member was
named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
“Fitch” means Fitch Ratings and its successors.
 “Investment grade rating” means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent)
by Moody’s and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating
agency or rating agencies selected by us.
 “Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and its successors.
 “Rating agencies” means (a) each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P; and (b) if any of Fitch, Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the
Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of our control, a “nationally recognized statistical
rating organization” (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) selected by us as a
replacement rating agency for a former rating agency.
 “Rating event” means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the rating agencies and the Notes are rated below an
investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so
long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after
the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a change of control and (b) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or our intention to
effect a change of control; provided that a rating event will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control
(and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of change of control triggering event) if each rating agency
making the reduction in rating does not publicly announce or confirm or inform the trustee in writing at our request that the reduction
was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the change of
control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event).
 “S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and its successors.
 “Voting stock” means, with respect to any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the
election of the board of directors of such person.
 Sinking Fund
 The Notes are not subject to, or entitled to the benefit of, any sinking fund.
Conversion or Exchange Rights
The Notes are not convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or other securities.
Certain Restrictive Covenants
The Indenture contains restrictive covenants that apply the Notes, the most significant of which are described below.
Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries 
Some of our property may be subject to a mortgage or other legal mechanism that gives our lenders preferential rights in that
property over other lenders, including direct holders of the Notes, or over our general creditors, if we fail to pay them back. These
preferential rights are called “liens.” The Indenture restricts our ability to create, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness
for borrowed money that is secured by a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance on:
●any flour mill, manufacturing or packaging plant or research laboratory located in the United States or Canada owned by us
or one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries; or
●any stock or debt issued by one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries
unless we also secure all the Notes that are still outstanding under the Indenture equally with the indebtedness being secured. This
promise does not restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of our interests in any United States or Canadian operating subsidiary.
These requirements do not apply to liens:
●existing on February 1, 1996 and any extensions, renewals or replacements of those liens;
●relating to the construction, improvement or purchase of a flour mill, plant or laboratory;
 ●in favor of us or one of our United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries;
●in favor of governmental units for financing construction, improvement or purchase of our property;
●existing on any property, stock or debt existing at the time we acquire it, including liens on property, stock or debt of a
United States or Canadian operating subsidiary at the time it became our United States or Canadian operating subsidiary;
●relating to the sale of our property;
●for work done on our property;
●relating to workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and similar obligations;
●relating to litigation or legal judgments;
●for taxes, assessments or governmental charges not yet due; or
●consisting of easements or other restrictions, defects in title or encumbrances on our real property.
We may also avoid securing the Notes equally with the indebtedness being secured if the amount of the indebtedness being
secured plus the value of any sale and lease back transactions, as described below, is 15% or less than the amount of our consolidated
total assets minus our consolidated non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.
If a merger or other transaction would create any liens that are not permitted as described above, we must grant an equivalent
lien to the direct holders of the Notes.
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions 
The Indenture also provides that we and our United States and Canadian operating subsidiaries will not enter into any sale
and leaseback transactions on any of our flourmills, manufacturing or packaging plants or research laboratories located in the United
States or Canada owned by us or one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries (“principal properties”)
unless we satisfy some restrictions. A sale and leaseback transaction involves our sale to a lender or other investor of a property of
ours and our leasing back that property from that party for more than three years, or a sale of a property to, and its lease back for three
or more years from, another person who borrows the necessary funds from a lender or other investor on the security of the property.
We may enter into a sale and leaseback transaction covering any of our principal properties only if:
●it falls into the exceptions for liens described above under “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and
Canadian Operating Subsidiaries”; or
●within 180 days after the property sale, we set aside for the retirement of funded debt, meaning notes or bonds that mature at
or may be extended to a date more than 12 months after issuance, an amount equal to the greater of:
othe net proceeds of the sale of the principal property, or
othe fair market value of the principal property sold, and in either case, minus
othe principal amount of any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are delivered to the trustee for retirement
within 120 days after the property sale, and
othe principal amount of any funded debt, other than debt securities issued under the Indenture, voluntarily retired by
us within 120 days after the property sale; or
●the attributable value, as described below, of all sale and leaseback transactions plus any indebtedness that we incur that, but
for the exception in the second to last paragraph of “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and
Canadian Operating Subsidiaries” above, would have required us to secure the Notes equally with it, is 15% or less than the
amount of our consolidated total assets minus our consolidated non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet.
 
 We determine the attributable value of a sale and leaseback transaction by choosing the lesser of (1) or (2) below:
1.sale price of the leased property x remaining portion of the base
term of the lease 
the base term of the lease
2.the total obligation of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining portion of the base term of the lease, discounted to
present value at the highest interest rate on any outstanding series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. The rental
payments in this calculation do not include amounts for property taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, water rates and other
items that are not payments for the property itself.
Mergers and Similar Events
We are generally permitted under the Indenture to consolidate or merge with another company. We are also permitted to sell
or lease some or all of our assets to another company. However, we may not take any of these actions unless the following conditions,
among others, are met:
●where we merge out of existence or sell or lease substantially all our assets, the other company must be a corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or trust organized under the laws of a state or the District of Columbia or under United States
federal law and it must expressly agree in a supplemental indenture to be legally responsible for the Notes; and
●the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not bring about a default on the Notes (for purposes of this test, a default
would include an event of default described below under “Default and Related Matters” and any event that would be an event
of default if the requirements for giving us notice of our default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time
were disregarded).
There is no precise, established definition of what would constitute a sale or lease of substantially all of our assets under
applicable law and, accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale or lease of less than all of our assets would subject us to
this provision.
If we merge out of existence or transfer (except through a lease) substantially all our assets, and the other firm becomes our
successor and is legally responsible for the Notes, we will be relieved of our own responsibility for the Notes.
Default and Related Matters
Noteholders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term “event of
default” means any of the following:
●we do not pay interest on a Note of that series within 30 days of its due date;
●we do not pay the principal or any premium on a Note of that series on its due date;
●we do not deposit money into a separate custodial account, known as a sinking fund, when such a deposit is due, if we agree
to maintain a sinking fund with respect to that series;
●we remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after
we receive a notice of default stating we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or direct holders of at least
25% of the principal amount of Notes of the affected series); or
●we file for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.
In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding, all of the Notes will automatically be due and
immediately payable. If a non-bankruptcy event of default has occurred with respect to any series of Notes and has not been cured, the
trustee or the direct holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of the affected series may declare the entire
principal amount of all the Notes of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a “declaration of acceleration of
maturity.”
 A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the direct holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Notes of the affected series if any other defaults on those Notes have been waived or cured and we pay or deposit with the trustee
an amount sufficient to pay the following with respect to the Notes of that series:
●all overdue interest;
●principal and premium, if any, which has become due, other than as a result of the acceleration, plus any interest on that
principal;
●interest on overdue interest, to the extent that payment is lawful; and
●amounts paid or advanced by the trustee and reasonable trustee compensation and expenses.
Except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the
Indenture at the request of any direct holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability,
called an “indemnity.” If reasonable indemnity is provided, the direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any
remedy available to the trustee. These majority direct holders may also direct the trustee in exercising any trust or power conferred on
the trustee under the Indenture.
Before an investor may bypass the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce
its rights or protect its interests relating to any Notes of any series, the following must occur:
●the investor must give the trustee written notice that an event of default with respect to the Notes of that series has occurred
and remains uncured;
●the direct holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Notes of that series must make a written request that
the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against any cost and
liabilities of taking that action;
●the trustee must not have received from direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that
series a direction inconsistent with the written notice; and
●the trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.
However, investors are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on a Note on or after its due date.
Every year we will certify in a written statement to the trustee that we are in compliance with the Indenture and each series of
Notes or specify any default that we know about.
Defeasance
In some circumstances described below, we may elect to discharge our obligations on the Notes through defeasance or
covenant defeasance.
Full Defeasance 
If there is a change in United States federal tax law as described below, we could legally release ourselves from any payment
or other obligations on the Notes, called “full defeasance,” if we put in place the following arrangements for investors to be repaid:
●we must irrevocably deposit in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of those Notes money or specified German
government securities or a combination of these that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other
payments on those Notes on their various due dates;
●there must be a change in current federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us make the deposit without
causing investors to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid such Notes
ourselves (under current United States federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the such Notes would be treated
as though we took back such Notes and gave investors their share of the cash and notes or bonds deposited in trust, in which
case investors could recognize gain or loss on those Notes); and
 ●we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming the United States tax law change described above.
In addition, no default must have occurred and be continuing with respect to those Notes at the time the deposit is made (and,
with respect only to bankruptcy and similar events, during the 90 days following the deposit), and we have delivered a certificate and a
legal opinion to the effect that the deposit does not:
●cause any outstanding Notes to be delisted;
●cause the trustee to have a “conflicting interest” within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;
●result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which we are party or by
which we are bound; and
●result in the trust arising from it constituting an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (unless we register the trust, or find an exemption from registration, under that Act).
If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, investors would have to rely solely on the trust deposit, and could no longer look
to us, for repayment on the Notes of the affected series. Conversely, the trust deposit would likely be protected from claims of our
lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.
Covenant Defeasance 
Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from
many of the covenants in the Notes. This is called “covenant defeasance.” In that event, investors would lose the protection of those
covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the applicable series of Notes. In
order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:
●make the same deposit of money and/or German government securities described above under “— Full Defeasance;”
●deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that under current United States federal income tax law we may make the
above deposit without causing investors to be taxed on the applicable series of Notes any differently than if we did not make
the deposit and simply repaid the applicable series of Notes ourselves; and
●comply with the other conditions precedent described above under “— Full Defeasance.”
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, the following provisions, among others, would no longer apply:
●the events of default relating to breach of covenants described below under “Default and Related Matters;” and
●any promises regarding conduct of our business, such as those described under “Certain Restrictive Covenants” below and
any other covenants applicable to the series of Notes.
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, investors can still look to us for repayment of the applicable series of Notes if there is
a shortfall in the trust deposit. Depending on the event causing the default, however, investors may not be able to obtain payment of
the shortfall.
Modification and Waiver
There are three types of changes we can make to the Indenture and the Notes.
First, there are changes that cannot be made to the Notes without specific investor approval. These include:
●change of the stated due date for payment of principal or interest on a series of Notes;
●reduction in the principal amount of, the rate of interest payable on or any premium payable upon redemption of a series of
Notes;
●reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a series of Notes following a default;
 ●change in the place or currency of payment on a series of Notes;
●impairment of an investor’s right to sue for payment on a series of Notes on or after the due date for such payment;
●reduction in the percentage of direct holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required to modify or amend the Indenture;
●reduction in the percentage of holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required under the Indenture to waive compliance
with provisions of, or to waive defaults under, the Indenture; and
●modification of any of the provisions described above or other provisions of the Indenture dealing with waiver of defaults or
covenants under the Indenture, except to increase the percentages required for such waivers or to provide that other
provisions of the Indenture cannot be changed without the consent of each direct holder affected by the change.
Second, changes may be made by us and the trustee without any vote by holders of any series of Notes. These include:
●evidencing the assumption by a successor of our obligations under the Indenture and any series of Notes;
●adding to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of Notes, or surrendering any of our rights or powers
under the Indenture;
●adding other events of default for the benefit of holders of any series of Notes;
●making such changes as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of any series of Notes in bearer or uncertificated
form;
●establishing the forms or terms of any series of Notes;
●evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee; and
●curing any ambiguity, correcting any Indenture provision that may be defective or inconsistent with other Indenture
provisions or making any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of Notes in any
material respect.
Third, we need a vote by direct holders of Notes owning at least a majority of the principal amount of each series affected by
the change to make any other change to the Indenture that is not of the type described in the preceding two paragraphs. A majority
vote of this kind is also required to obtain a waiver of any past default, except a payment default on principal or interest or concerning
a provision of the Indenture that cannot be changed without the consent of the direct holder.
When taking a vote, we will decide how much principal amount to attribute to a series of Notes by using the dollar
equivalent, as determined by our Board of Directors.
Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore will not be eligible to vote, if owned by us or one of our affiliates or
if we have deposited or set aside money in trust for their payment or redemption. Notes will also not be eligible to vote if they have
been fully defeased as described below under “Defeasance — Full Defeasance.”
We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the direct holders of outstanding
Notes that are entitled to vote or take other action under the Indenture. In some circumstances, generally related to a default by us on a
series of the Notes, the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders.
Trustee
U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee under the Indenture, has been appointed by us as transfer agent
and registrar with regard to the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes. The trustee also acts as an agent for the issuance of our United States
commercial paper. Affiliates of the trustee currently provide cash management and other banking and advisory services to us in the
normal course of business and may from time to time in the future provide other banking and advisory services to us in the ordinary
course of business, in each case in exchange for a fee.
 Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Note
  We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and
Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and their book-entry systems and
procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In
addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream
and Euroclear as they were in effect at the time of the issuance of the Notes of each series. Those clearing systems could change their
rules and procedures at any time.
 The Notes are represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note is deposited with, or on behalf
of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and
Euroclear. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective nominees. Investors may hold interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear, either as a
participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will
hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers’ securities
accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the Notes and all
transfers relating to the Notes are reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear.
 The distribution of the Notes is cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry
interests in the Notes takes place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and settles in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry
interests in the Notes receive payments relating to their Notes in euro, except as described under the heading “Payments in Euro.”
 Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial
links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow book-entry interests in the
Notes to be issued, held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to
facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the
secondary market.
 The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the
investor’s interest in the Notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear
or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also do not supervise these systems in any way.
 Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they
have made with one another or with their customers. Investors should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to
perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.
 Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes will not be entitled to have the Notes registered in their
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners
or holders of the Notes under the Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to
the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if
such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise
any rights of a holder of Notes.
 We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:
 Clearstream
 Clearstream advises that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds
securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”). Clearstream facilitates the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream
Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants,
among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and
securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary,
Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de
Surveillance du Secteur Financier). Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may
include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant, either directly or indirectly.
 Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream are credited to the cash accounts of
Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures.
  Euroclear
 Euroclear advises that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to
clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment,
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and
cash. Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in
several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”). All operations are conducted by the
Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear
Operator. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional
financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.
 The Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, or the
Euroclear Terms and Conditions, and applicable Belgian law govern securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the
Euroclear Operator. Specifically, these terms and conditions govern:
●transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear;
●withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear; and
●receipt of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear.
 All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the terms and conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants, and has no
record of or relationship with persons holding securities through Euroclear Participants.
 Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear are credited to the cash accounts of
Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions.
 Clearance and Settlement Procedures
 We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement
procedures that are applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Notes are credited to the securities custody accounts of
Clearstream and Euroclear participants on the business day following the settlement date, for value on the settlement date. They are
credited either free of payment or against payment for value on the settlement date.
 We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary
way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using
procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form.
 Investors should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those
systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.
 In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and
Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make
or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next
business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.
 Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as
applicable, in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the
Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a
Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.
 Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Notes
among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those
procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time.
 Certificated Notes
 Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive
form of like tenor in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:
(1)the common depositary (A) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes or (B) has
ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed;
(2)we, at our option, notify the trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes; or
(3)there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the notes.
In all cases, certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note will be registered in the names, and issued in any
approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).
Payments (including principal, premium and interest) and transfers with respect to Notes in certificated form may be
executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose in London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such
purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the
applicable Notes, provided that all payments (including principal, premium and interest) on Notes in certificated form, for which the
holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

computations of interest and fees under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and
actual days elapsed, which results in more interest or fees, as applicable, being paid than if computed on
the basis of a 365-day year; provided that if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a
different basis of computation is the market convention for a particular Alternative Currency, such
different basis shall be used. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest or
such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof. ............................................... 30

Agent may assume that each Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds on the Borrowing date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Bank has not in fact made its share of the applicable
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Bank and the Company severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount

excess of its Commitment Percentage of payments on account of the Loans and Letter of Credit
Liabilities obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (i) notify the Administrative Agent of
such fact, and (ii) purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them and the
Letter of Credit Liabilities held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the
excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor,
together with an amount equal to such paying Bank’s Commitment Percentage (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a
participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.11) with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company in the
amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive
and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13
and will in each case notify the Banks following any such purchases or repayments.............................. 33

Bank for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank to satisfy such Bank’s obligations
to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such
amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations

SECTION 9.04 . Reliance by Administrative Agent . ....(a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation
(including, without limitation, telephonic or electronic notices, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution, Notices of Borrowing and Notices of Conversion/Continuation) reasonably believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons
even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not
preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as
understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, each Bank and their respective Affiliates and their and their
respective Affiliates’ partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, administrators, managers,
advisors and representatives from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Company. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have
been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Majority Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Banks and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks. ..................................................... 66
 SECTION 9.05 . Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice
of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks,
unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank or the Company
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
“notice of default”. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative
Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance
with Article 8;provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
any such request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Banks. ........................................................................................... 67
SECTION 9.06 . Credit Decision. ........................................................................................................................  67
SECTION 9.07 . Indemnification. The Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Administrative Agent-Related
Persons, the Sustainability Coordinator and any Issuing Bank (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of the Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably in
accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments, or if no Revolving Commitments are in
effect, in accordance with their respective outstanding Loans, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of
any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the repayment of the
Loans and the termination or resignation of the Administrative Agent) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against any such Person any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Letter of
Credit or any document contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of
the foregoing;provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Administrative
Agent-Related Persons or the Sustainability Coordinator of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent
resulting from such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator and any
Issuing Bank upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including
Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this
Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or
on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Internal Revenue
Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim
that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of
any Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly executed, or because such Bank
failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent
as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.07, together with all costs and
expenses and attorneys’ fees (including Attorney Costs). A certificate as to the amount of such liability
delivered to any Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each
Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time
owing to such Bank under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the
Bank from any source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.07. The
obligation of the Banks in this Section 9.07 shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder. .... 68
 SECTION 9.08 . Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity . Bank of America and its Affiliates may make
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative
Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant
to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or
its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the
Company or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms “Bank” and “Banks” shall include Bank of
America in its individual capacity. ........................................................................................................... 69
SECTION 9.09 . Successor Administrative Agent . ............................................................................................... 69
SECTION 9.10 . Lead Arrangers, Sustainability Coordinator and Other Agents . Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents or the
Sustainability Coordinator listed on the cover page hereof shall have any obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those in its capacity, as applicable, as the
Administrative Agent, a Bank or Issuing Bank hereunder. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not
relied, and will not rely, on the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents or Sustainability
Coordinator in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. The
Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents and Sustainability Coordinator shall
have the express benefit of this Section 9.10 and Sections 10.05 and 10.07. ........................................... 70
SECTION 9.11 . Certain ERISA Matters . ............................................................................................................  70
SECTION 9.12 . Recovery of Erroneous Payments. Without limitation of any other provision in this
Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Bank
(the “Credit Party”), whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by the Company at such
time, where such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Credit Party receiving
a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
Rescindable Amount received by such Credit Party in immediately available funds in the currency so
received, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is
received by it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Credit Party irrevocably waives any and all defenses,
including any “discharge for value” (under which a creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds
mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its obligation
to return any Rescindable Amount. The Administrative Agent shall inform each Credit Party promptly
upon determining that any payment made to such Credit Party comprised, in whole or in part, a
Rescindable Amount. ................................................................................................................................ 71

Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent resulting from (i) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of such
Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
judgment, (ii) a claim brought by the Company against an Indemnified Person for a material breach of
such Indemnified Person’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Company

competent jurisdiction or (iii) a claim not involving an act or omission of the Company and that is
brought by an Indemnified Person against another Indemnified Person (other than against the
Sustainability Coordinator, Lead Arrangers or the Agents in their capacities as such). The agreements in
this Section 10.05 shall survive payment of all other Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
This Section 10.05 shall not apply with respect to taxes other than any taxes that represent losses,
claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-tax claim. ............................................................................. 75

subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority
Banks) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party in connection with any Insolvency
Proceeding, or otherwise, then ( A) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred, and ( B) each Bank severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent upon demand its ratable share of the total amount so recovered from or repaid

Coordinator and their respective Affiliates (each, a “ Bank Party”) may have economic interests that
conflict with those of the Company. The Company agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or
otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other
implied duty between the Bank Parties and the Company, its stockholders or Affiliates. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that ( I) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents are arm’s-length
 commercial transactions between the Bank Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, (II) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transactions, each Bank Party is
acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, its management,
stockholders, creditors or any other person, ( III) no Bank Party has assumed an advisory or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or in any

to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and ( IV) the Company
has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company
further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with
respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Company agrees that it will not claim
that any Bank Party has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or
similar duty to the Company, its stockholder or Affiliates, in connection with such transactions or the
process leading thereto. ............................................................................................................................. 76

Subsidiary of the Company, or by the Administrative Agent on such Company’s or Subsidiary’s behalf,
in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor
any of its Affiliates shall use any such information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant
to the terms contemplated by this Agreement; except to the extent such information: ............................ 79
SECTION 10.11 . Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being waived by the Company to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing to, such Bank or any
of its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all Obligations owing
to such Bank or Affiliate, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative
Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although
such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company
and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank or Affiliate; provided, however,
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Bank under this Section 10.11 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other
rights of set-off) which the Bank may have. ............................................................................................. 81
SECTION 10.12 . Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc . Each Bank shall notify the Administrative

it. ...............................................................................................................................................................  82
SECTION 10.20 . Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents and the Fee
Letters, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company, the Banks and the

 SECTION 10.21 . USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Bank that is subject to the Patriot Act and the
Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby notifies the Company that

other information that will allow such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the
Company in accordance with the Patriot Act. .......................................................................................... 83
SECTION 10.22 . Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or

rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Company in respect of any such
sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than that in which
such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the
“Agreement Currency ”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt
by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the
Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, may in accordance
with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the
amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent or any Bank from the Company in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees,
as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent
or such Bank, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so
purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Bank in such
currency, the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any
excess to the Company (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). ...... 83
SECTION 10.24 . Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan
Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the
maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the “ Maximum Rate”). If the
Administrative Agent or any Bank shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal,
refunded to the Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by
the Administrative Agent or a Bank exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and
(c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. ............................................................ 84
SECTION 10.25 . Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan Documents
provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or
instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC Credit Support ”, and each such QFC, a “ Supported
QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit
Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any
 Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the
United States or any other state of the United States): .............................................................................  84

(b) References herein to “fiscal year” and “fiscal quarter” refer to such fiscal periods of the Company.
SECTION 1.04.Additional Alternative Currencies . 
(a) The Company may from time to time request that Eurocurrency Rate Loans be made in a currency
other than those specifically listed in the definition of “Alternative Currency”; provided that such requested
currency is an Eligible Currency. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Eurocurrency
Rate Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Bank.
(b) Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time), twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Borrowing (or such other time or date as
may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to
Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank (in the
case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later
than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time), ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents,
in its sole discretion, to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency.
(c) Any failure by a Bank to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Bank to permit Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in such
requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Banks consent to making Eurocurrency Rate Loans
in such requested currency and the Administrative Agent and such Banks reasonably determine that an
appropriate interest rate is available to be used for such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so
notify the Company and (i) the Administrative Agent and such Banks may amend the definition of
Eurocurrency Rate to the extent necessary to add the applicable Eurocurrency Rate for such currency and (ii) to
the extent the definition of Eurocurrency Rate reflects the appropriate interest rate for such currency or has been
amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all
purposes to be an Alternative Currency for purposes of any Borrowings of Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the
Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this
Section 1.04, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Company.
 SECTION 1.05. Interest Rates. The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept
responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration,
submission or any other matter related to any reference rate referred to herein or with respect to any rate
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection of such rate and any related spread or other adjustment)
that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate (including, without limitation, any
Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any
Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in
transactions or other activities that affect any reference rate referred to herein, or any alternative, successor or
replacement rate (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing)
or any related spread or other adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Company. The
Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any
reference rate referred to herein or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including, without limitation,
any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing), in each case pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Company, any Bank or any other person or entity for damages of
any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or
expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or other action or
omission related to or affecting the selection, determination, or calculation of any rate (or component thereof)
provided by any such information source or service.

THECREDIT
SECTION 2.01. The Revolving Credit.
(a) Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Loans
denominated in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency to the Company from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date, in an amount such that (i) the
aggregate principal amount of Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding plus the aggregate amount of its
Letter of Credit Liabilities at such time shall not exceed the amount of its Revolving Commitment, (ii) the Total
Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and (iii) the Total Outstanding
Amount denominated in Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit. Within the
limits of each Bank’s Revolving Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Company may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.06 and reborrow pursuant to this
Section 2.01.
 (b) The Revolving Termination Date may be extended on up to two occasions in the manner set forth
in this subsection (b) for a period of one year from the Revolving Termination Date then in effect. If the
Company wishes to request an extension of the Revolving Termination Date then in effect, the Company shall
give notice to that effect to the Administrative Agent not less than 45 nor more than 90 days prior to any
anniversary of the Closing Date, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each of the Banks
of such request. Each Bank will use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such request, whether
affirmatively or negatively, as it may elect in its sole discretion, within 30 days of such notice to the
Administrative Agent. Any Bank not responding to such request within such time period shall be deemed to
have responded negatively to such request. The Company may request the Banks that do not elect to extend the
Revolving Termination Date to assign their Commitments in their entirety to one or more Eligible Assignees
pursuant toSection 10.09 which Eligible Assignees will agree to extend the Revolving Termination Date. If
Banks having 50.1% or more of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments (including such Eligible
Assignees and excluding their respective transferor Banks) respond affirmatively, then, subject to receipt by the
Administrative Agent of counterparts of an Extension Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto
duly completed and signed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and such Banks, the Revolving
Termination Date shall be extended to the first anniversary of the Revolving Termination Date then in effect
with respect to such Banks (but not with respect to Banks not so responding affirmatively). Any extension of
the Revolving Termination Date pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions
set forth inSection 4.02(b) andSection 4.02(c), and any request for an extension by the Company hereunder
shall constitute a representation and warranty that such conditions are satisfied at the time of such extension and
after giving effect thereto.
SECTION 2.02.Register.  (a) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Company (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Agent’s Payment Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic
form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Revolving
Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities owing
to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register”).  The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Bank, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(b) The Company hereby agrees that, upon the request of any Bank at any time, such Bank’s Loans shall be
evidenced by a promissory note or notes of the Company (each a “ Note”), substantially in the form of Exhibit D
hereto, payable to such Bank or its registered assigns and representing the obligation of the Company to pay the
unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank, with interest as provided herein on the unpaid
principal amount from time to time outstanding.
SECTION 2.03. Procedure For Borrowing. (a) Each Borrowing of Loans shall be made upon the
Company’s irrevocable written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A)
telephone or (B) a Notice of Borrowing ( provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing) and which notice must be received by the

 (A) the amount of the Borrowing, which shall be in an aggregate minimum Dollar
Amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or any multiple of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (or, if such Borrowing is in an Alternative Currency, an approximately equivalent
amount in the relevant currency, as agreed by the Company and Administrative Agent) in excess
thereof for each Type of Loan;
(B) the currency and the aggregate amount (in such currency) of such Borrowing;
(C) the requested Borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day;
(D) whether the Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Base

Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, such Interest Period
shall be one month;
provided that if the Company fails to specify a currency in a Notice of Borrowing, then the Loans so requested
shall be made in Dollars; provided,further that if the Company fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Notice of
Borrowing, then the Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.
The exercise by the Company of the elections specified above shall be subject to the limitation that no more
than ten Tranches of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Term SOFR Loans, collectively, may be outstanding at any
one time.
(b) Upon receipt of the Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
Bank thereof and of the amount of such Bank’s Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing.

Administrative Agent for the account of the Company:
(i) if such Borrowing is to be made in Dollars, at the Agent’s Payment Office by 3:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the Borrowing date requested by the Company in funds immediately available
to the Administrative Agent; or
(ii) if such Borrowing is to be made in an Alternative Currency, in such Alternative Currency
in immediately available funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent
to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated for such purpose for Loans in such
Alternative Currency by notice to the Banks.
Any such amount which is received by the Administrative Agent later than (x) in the case of clause (i) above,
3:00 p.m. (New York City time) and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Applicable Time specified by the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day. The
proceeds of all such Loans will then be made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent by wire
transfer in accordance with written instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by the Company of like
funds as received by the Administrative Agent.
(d) Unless the Majority Banks shall otherwise agree, during the existence of a Default or Event of
Default, the Company may not elect to have a Loan be made as an Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR
Loan.
 
 SECTION 2.04.Conversion and Continuation Elections . (a) The Company may upon irrevocable
written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with subsection 2.04(b):
(i) in the case of any Dollar-Denominated Loan, elect to convert on any Business Day, any
Base Rate Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Term SOFR Loans; or
(ii) in the case of any Dollar-Denominated Loan, elect to convert on any Interest Payment
Date any Term SOFR Loans maturing on such Interest Payment Date (or any part thereof in an amount
not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Base
Rate Loans; or
(iii) elect to renew on any Interest Payment Date any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term
SOFR Loans maturing on such Interest Payment Date (or any part thereof in an amount not less than
$5,000,000, or, in the case of any Dollar-Denominated Loans, that is in an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 (or, if such Eurocurrency Rate Loans are Alternative Currency Loans, an approximately
equivalent amount in the relevant currency, as agreed by the Company and Administrative Agent) in
excess thereof) in Loans of the same currency.
(b) The Company shall deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent, which may
be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Notice of Conversion/Continuation ( provided that any telephonic notice
must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation) and which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) in
the case of Dollar-Denominated Loans, 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days in advance
of the Conversion Date or continuation date and (ii) in the case of any Alternative Currency Loans, 1:00 p.m.
(New York City time) at least four Business Days in advance of the continuation date, specifying in each case:
(A) the proposed Conversion Date or continuation date;
(B) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or renewed;
(C) the nature of the proposed conversion or continuation; and
(D) the duration of the requested Interest Period.
The exercise by the Company of the elections specified above shall be subject to the limitation that no more
than ten Tranches of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Term SOFR Loans, collectively, may be outstanding at any
one time.
(c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term
SOFR Loans, the Company has failed to deliver timely a Notice of Conversion/Continuation selecting a new
Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, or if any Default or
Event of Default shall then exist, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current
Interest Period;provided,however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their
original currency with an Interest Period of one month. Except as provided pursuant to Section 3.05, no Loan
may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid
in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
 (d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Bank thereof, or, if no timely notice is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion. All conversions and continuations shall
be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans held by each Bank with
respect to which the notice was given.
(e) Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.04, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan may
be continued or converted from time to time; provided that if any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR is
converted at a time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Company shall pay, upon
demand, any amounts due to the Banks pursuant to Section 3.04. Unless the Majority Banks shall otherwise
agree, during the existence of a Default or Event of Default, the Company may not elect to have a Loan
converted into or continued as an Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, and the Majority
Banks may demand that any or all of the outstanding Term SOFR Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate
Loans and any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans be prepaid, or redenominated into
Dollars in the applicable Dollar Amount thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto.
SECTION 2.05.Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments . The Company may, upon not
less than five Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving
Commitment or permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitment by an aggregate minimum amount
of $25,000,000 or any multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof; provided that (i) no such reduction or
termination shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the
effective date thereof, the then Total Outstanding Amount would exceed the amount of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitment then in effect and (ii) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitment, the Alternative Currency Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitment, such Alternative Currency Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. 
Any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment shall be applied to each Bank’s Revolving
Commitment in accordance with such Bank’s Commitment Percentage. All accrued facility fees to, but not
including the effective date of any reduction or termination of Revolving Commitments, shall be paid on the
effective date of such reduction or termination.
 SECTION 2.06.Payments.  
(a) Optional Payments . Subject toSection 3.04, the Company may, at any time or from time to time,
upon notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a written notice
(provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of
a written notice) and which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 12:00 noon
(New York City time) on the date of prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Loans, (ii) 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on the second Business Day prior to the date of prepayment, in the case of Term SOFR Loans (iii)

Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Euros, or (iv) 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth
Business Day prior to the date of prepayment, in case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in any other
Alternative Currency, ratably prepay Loans in whole or in part, in amounts of $5,000,000 or any multiple of
$1,000,000 (or, if such prepayment is in an Alternative Currency, an approximately equivalent amount in the
relevant currency, as agreed by the Company and Administrative Agent) in excess thereof. Such notice of
prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and whether such prepayment is of Base Rate
Loans, or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or any combination thereof. Such notice shall not thereafter be revocable
by the Company and the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Bank thereof and of such Bank’s
Commitment Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein, together with accrued interest to each such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts
required pursuant to Section 3.04.
(b) Mandatory Payments . If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Total
Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal
to 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the
Company shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Total Outstanding Amount as of
such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit.
SECTION 2.07.Repayment. The Company shall repay to the Banks in full on the Revolving
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding on the Revolving Termination Date. 
SECTION 2.08.Interest.  (a) Subject to subsection 2.08(c), each Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the date when made until it becomes due at a rate per annum equal to
the Eurocurrency Rate or the Base Rate or Term SOFR, as the case may be, plus the Applicable Margin. To the
extent that any calculation of interest or any fee required to be paid under this Agreement shall be based on (or
result in) a rate that is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed zero for purposes of this Agreement.
(b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and
at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any prepayment of
Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 for the portion of the Loans so prepaid and upon payment (including
prepayment) in full thereof. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof
before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding, under the Bankruptcy
Code. Any interest accrued pursuant to subsection 2.08(c) shall be paid on demand.
(c) If any principal of or interest on any Loan or any other fee or other amount payable by the
Company under any Loan Document is not paid when due (following the expiration of any grace period
specified inArticle 8), whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall
bear interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) at a rate per
annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such
Loan as provided in subsection 2.08(a) or (ii) in the case of any other amount, the Base Rate plus 2%.
 (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Company hereunder shall
be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required, for any period for which interest is
computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by the
respective Bank would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such Bank limiting the highest rate
of interest which may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Bank, and in such event the
Company shall pay such Bank interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law. 
SECTION 2.09.Fees.  
(a) Facility Fees. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a
facility fee in Dollars on such Bank’s Credit Exposure, computed on a quarterly basis in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Facility Fee Rate set forth in
the Pricing Schedule. Such facility fee shall accrue from the Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date
and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing
on June 30, 2021 through the Revolving Termination Date, with the final payment to be made on the Revolving
Termination Date; provided that, in connection with any reduction or termination of the Credit Exposures
pursuant to Section 2.05 or2.06, the accrued facility fee calculated for the period ending on such date shall also
be paid on the date of such reduction or termination, with the next succeeding quarterly payment, if any, being
calculated on the basis of the period from the reduction date to such quarterly payment date. The facility fees
provided in this subsection shall accrue at all times after the above-mentioned commencement date, including at
any time during which one or more conditions in Article 4 are not met.
(b) Administrative Agency Fee . The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
Administrative Agent’s own account an agency fee and other sums in the amount and at the times set forth in
the Fee Letter with Bank of America and BofA Securities.
(c) Letter of Credit Fees . The Company shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Banks ratably a letter of credit fee accruing daily on the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit at a rate per annum equal to the Letter of Credit Fee Rate for such day and (ii) to each Issuing
Bank for its own account, a letter of credit fronting fee accruing daily on the aggregate amount then available
for drawing under all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at such rate as may be mutually agreed
between the Company and such Issuing Bank from time to time. Such letter of credit fees shall accrue from the
Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date (or, if later, the latest date on which any Letter of Credit may
be drawn) and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
commencing on June 30, 2021 through the Revolving Termination Date (or such latest date), with the final
payment to be made on the Revolving Termination Date (or such latest date).
SECTION 2.10.Computation of Fees and Interest . (a) All computations of interest for Base Rate
Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) and facility fees shall be made on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of
interest and fees under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed,
which results in more interest or fees, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year;
provided that if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a different basis of computation is the
market convention for a particular Alternative Currency, such different basis shall be used. Interest and fees
shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the
last day thereof.
 (b) The Administrative Agent will, with reasonable promptness, notify the Company and the Banks of
the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Term SOFR Loans upon
determination of such interest rate; provided that any failure to do so shall not relieve the Company of any
liability hereunder or provide the basis for any claim against the Administrative Agent. At any time that Base
Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Banks of any change in
Bank of America’s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement
of such change.
(c) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto shall be
conclusive and binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative
Agent will, at the request of the Company or any Bank, deliver to the Company or the Bank, as the case may be,
a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate.
SECTION 2.11. Payments by the Company . (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made
by the Company on account of principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be made
without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim; shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to
the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Banks at the Agent’s Payment Office, and shall be made
(i) in the case of Dollar-Denominated Loans, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 2:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein and (ii) in the case of Alternative Currency Loans, in
the relevant Alternative Currency and in immediately available funds, no later than the Applicable Time
specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly
distribute on such date to each Bank its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as expressly
provided herein) of such principal, interest, fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment
which is received by the Administrative Agent later than (i) 2:00 p.m. (New York City time), in the case of
payments in Dollars, or (ii) the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments
in Alternative Currencies, shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day
and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.
(b) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be; subject to the provisions set forth in the
definition of “Interest Period” herein. 
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date
on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks hereunder that the
Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such
payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Banks the amount due.
With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Banks
hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “ Rescindable Amount ”): (1)
the Company has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of
the amount so paid by the Company (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any
reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Banks severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Bank, in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal
Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Bank or the Company with respect to any amount owing
under this clause (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12.Payments by the Banks to the Agent . (a) Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from a Bank on the Closing Date or, with respect to each Borrowing after the Closing
Date, prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of any proposed Borrowing, that such Bank will not
make available to the Administrative Agent as and when required hereunder for the account of the Company the
amount of that Bank’s Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that
each Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the
Borrowing date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Bank has
not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Bank and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the
date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Bank, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative,
processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing,
and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Company, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or
in the case of Alternative Currencies in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable.
(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date of borrowing shall not relieve any other
Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such borrowing, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of
any borrowing.
 SECTION 2.13.Sharing of Payments, Etc . (a) If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere
herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the Letter of Credit Liabilities held by it,
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in
excess of its Commitment Percentage of payments on account of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities
obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii)
purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them and the Letter of Credit
Liabilities held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment
ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall
repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Bank’s Commitment Percentage (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank’s required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid
or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any
Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.11)
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the
absence of manifest error) of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify
the Banks following any such purchases or repayments.
 (b) If any Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 0,2.12,
2.14(a) or9.07, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank to satisfy such Bank’s obligations to it under such
Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated
account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Bank under any such
Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent
in its discretion.
SECTION 2.14. Increased Commitments; Additional Banks. (a) From time to time the
Company may, upon at least five days’ notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly provide a
copy of such notice to the Banks), increase the Aggregate Revolving Commitments by an amount not less than
$10,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the “ Increased Revolving Commitments ”).
(b) To effect such an increase, the Company may designate one or more of the existing Banks or other
financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank which at the time agree to
(i) in the case of any such Person that is an existing Bank, increase its Revolving Commitment and (ii) in the
case of any other such Person (an “ Additional Bank ”), become a party to this Agreement with a Revolving
Commitment of not less than $10,000,000.
(c) Any increase in the Revolving Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be subject to
satisfaction of the following conditions:
(i) before and after giving effect to such increase, all representations and warranties
contained inArticle 5 shall be true as of the date of such increase (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true as of
such earlier date);
(ii) at the time of such increase, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would
result from such increase; 
 (iii) after giving effect to such increase, the increases in the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments made pursuant to this Section 2.14, shall not exceed $1,000,000,000; and
(iv) at least three Business Days prior to the effectiveness of any such increase, the Company,
to the extent it qualifies as a “legal entity customer” under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation shall
have delivered, to each Bank that so requests, a Beneficial Ownership Certification. 
(d) If the Aggregate Revolving Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.14, the
Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date. As a condition to such increase, the
Administrative Agent shall have received (i) an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent signed by the Company, by each Additional Bank and by each other Bank whose
Revolving Commitment is to be increased, setting forth the new Revolving Commitments of such Banks and
setting forth the agreement of each Additional Bank to become a party to this Agreement and to be bound by all
the terms and provisions hereof, (ii) such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part of the
Company with respect to the Increased Revolving Commitments and such opinions of counsel for the Company
with respect to the Increased Revolving Commitments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and
(iii) a certificate of the Company stating that the conditions set forth in subsection (c) above have been satisfied.
(e) Upon any increase in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14, (i) the
respective Letter of Credit Liabilities of the Banks shall be redetermined as of the effective date of such increase
and (ii) within five Business Days, in the case of any group of Base Rate Loans then outstanding, and at the end
of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, in the case of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term
SOFR Loans then outstanding, the Company shall prepay such Loans in their entirety and, to the extent the
Company elects to do so and subject to the conditions specified in Article 4, the Company shall reborrow the
Loans from the Banks in proportion to their respective Revolving Commitments after giving effect to such
increase, until such time as all outstanding Loans are held by the Banks in such proportion.
SECTION 2.15. Letters of Credit.
(a) Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing
Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit from time to time in Dollars up to 30 days prior to the Revolving
Termination Date upon the request of the Company; provided that, immediately after each Letter of Credit is
issued (i) the Total Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed $50,000,000; provided that no Bank shall
be obligated for any amount in excess of its Revolving Commitment. Upon the date of issuance by an Issuing
Bank of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to
have sold to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have
purchased from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit
Liabilities in the proportion its Revolving Commitment bears to the Aggregate Revolving Commitment.
 (b) Method for Issuance; Terms; Extensions . (i) The Company shall give the Issuing Bank notice in
the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company, at least three Business Days (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its
discretion) prior to the requested issuance of a Letter of Credit (or, in the case of renewal or extension, prior to
the Issuing Bank’s deadline for notice of nonextension) specifying the date such Letter of Credit is to be issued
(or, as the case may be, extended or renewed), and describing the terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature
of the transactions to be supported thereby. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by
United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the Issuing
Bank, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the Issuing Bank. Upon receipt of a Letter of
Credit Application, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Bank’s participation in
such Letter of Credit.
(ii) The obligation of any Issuing Bank to issue each Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Letter of
Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing
Bank and that the Company shall have executed and delivered such other customary instruments and
agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank shall have reasonably requested. The
Company shall also pay to the Issuing Bank for its own account issuance, drawing, amendment,
settlement and extension charges, if any, in the amounts and at the times as agreed between the
Company and the Issuing Bank.
(iii) The extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an issuance of
such Letter of Credit, and if any Letter of Credit contains a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to
be extended unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank shall timely give
such notice of termination unless it has theretofore timely received a Letter of Credit Application and the
other conditions to issuance of a Letter of Credit have also theretofore been met with respect to such
extension. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or before the close of business on the date that is one
year after such Letter of Credit is issued (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year
after such renewal or extension); provided that (x) a Letter of Credit may contain a provision pursuant to
which it is deemed to be extended on an annual basis unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing
Bank and (y) in no event will a Letter of Credit expire (including pursuant to a renewal or extension
thereof) on a date later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Revolving Termination Date.
(iv) The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall
by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing the Letter of Credit, or
any law applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall
prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to the
Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not
otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; or
(B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the
Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.
 (c) Payments; Reimbursement Obligations . (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative
Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each other Bank as to the amount
to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the date such payment is to be made by the Issuing Bank
(the “Payment Date”). The Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for any amounts paid by the Issuing Bank upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, without
presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Such reimbursement shall be due on the Payment
Date;provided that no such payment shall be due from the Company any earlier than the date of receipt by it of
notice of its obligation to make such payment (or, if such notice is received by the Company after 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on any date, on the next succeeding Business Day); and provided,further that if and to
the extent any such reimbursement is not made by the Company in accordance with this clause (ii) or clause(iii)
below on the Payment Date, then (irrespective of when notice thereof is received by the Company), such
Reimbursement Obligation shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the
Payment Date to but not including the date such Reimbursement Obligation is paid in full at a rate per annum
equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.
(ii) If the Revolving Commitments remain in effect on the Payment Date, all such amounts
paid by the Issuing Bank and remaining unpaid by the Company after the date and time required by
clause (i) above (a “ Reimbursement Obligation ”) shall, if and to the extent that the amount of such
Reimbursement Obligation would be permitted as a Borrowing pursuant to Section 4.02, and unless the
Company otherwise instructs the Administrative Agent by not less than one Business Day’s prior notice,
convert automatically to Base Rate Loans on the date such Reimbursement Obligation arises. The
Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably directs the
Administrative Agent so to act on its behalf), give notice no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time)
on such date requesting each Bank to make, and each Bank hereby agrees to make, a Base Rate Loan, in
an amount equal to such Bank’s pro rata share of the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to which
such notice relates. Each Bank shall make such Loan available to the Administrative Agent at its address
referred to inSection 10.02 in immediately available funds, not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time), on the date specified in such notice. The Administrative Agent shall pay the proceeds of such
Loans to the Issuing Bank, which shall immediately apply such proceeds to repay the Reimbursement
Obligation.
(iii) To the extent a Reimbursement Obligation is not funded by a Bank pursuant to clause (ii)
above, such Bank will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank,
immediately upon the Issuing Bank’s demand at any time during the period commencing after such
Reimbursement Obligation arises until reimbursement therefor in full by the Company, an amount equal
to such Bank’s pro rata share of such Reimbursement Obligation, together with interest on such amount
for each day from the date of the Issuing Bank’s demand for such payment (or, if such demand is made
after 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date
of payment by such Bank of such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to the applicable
Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees
customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. The Issuing Bank will pay to
each Bank ratably all amounts received from the Company for application in payment of its
Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Bank has
made payment to the Issuing Bank in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant hereto; provided that in
the event such payment received by the Issuing Bank is required to be returned under any of the
circumstances described in Section 10.06, such Bank will return to the Issuing Bank any portion thereof
previously distributed to it by the Issuing Bank, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to
the date such amount is returned by such Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight
Rate from time to time in effect.
 (d) Obligations Absolute . The obligations of the Company and each Bank under subsection (c) above
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation the following circumstances:
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Letter of Credit or any
document related hereto or thereto;
(ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions
of this Agreement or any Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto, provided by any
party affected thereby;
(iii) the use which may be made of the Letter of Credit by, or any acts or omission of, a
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting);
(iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other rights that the Company may have at
any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be
acting), any Bank (including the Issuing Bank) or any other Person, whether in connection with this
Agreement or the Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any unrelated transaction;
(v) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect whatsoever;
(vi) payment under a Letter of Credit against presentation to the Issuing Bank of documents
that do not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(vii) any termination of the Revolving Commitments prior to, on or after the Payment Date for
any Letter of Credit, whether at the scheduled termination thereof, by operation of Article 8 or
otherwise; or
(viii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Bank (including the Issuing
Bank), the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever that
might, but for the provisions of this subsection (viii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or
defense to the Company’s or the Bank’s obligations hereunder.
(e) Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the
Issuing Bank and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each
standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible to the
Company for, and the Issuing Bank’s rights and remedies against the Company shall not be impaired by, any
action or inaction of the Issuing Bank required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or
permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the law or any order of a
jurisdiction where the Issuing Bank or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as
applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking
Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association
(BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit
chooses such law or practice.
 (f) Indemnification; Expenses . (i) The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Bank
(including each Issuing Bank) and the Administrative Agent from and against any and all claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur in connection with a Letter of Credit issued
pursuant to this Section 2.15;provided that the Company shall not be required to indemnify any Bank or the
Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses, to the extent finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Person.
(ii) None of the Banks (including, subject to subsection (g) below, an Issuing Bank) nor the
Administrative Agent nor any of their officers or directors or employees or agents shall be liable or
responsible, by reason of or in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit, including without limitation any of the circumstances
enumerated in subsection (d) above;provided that, notwithstanding subsection (d) above, the Company
shall have a claim for direct (but not consequential) damage suffered by it, to the extent finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (x) the Issuing Bank’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of
Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (y) the Issuing Bank’s failure to pay under
any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documents strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit; provided, further that each Bank shall have a claim for direct (but not
consequential) damage suffered by it, to the extent finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have been caused by the Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in
determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such
Letter of Credit. The parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face
to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make
payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.
(iii) Nothing in this subsection (e) is intended to limit the obligations of the Company under
any other provision of this Agreement. To the extent the Company does not indemnify an Issuing Bank
as required by this subsection, the Banks agree to do so ratably in accordance with their Revolving
Commitments.
(g) Stop Issuance Notice . If the Majority Banks determine at any time that the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at such time, then the Majority Banks may request
that the Administrative Agent issue a “Stop Issuance Notice”, and the Administrative Agent shall issue such
notice to each Issuing Bank. Such Stop Issuance Notice shall be withdrawn upon a determination by the
Majority Banks that the circumstances giving rise thereto no longer exist. No Letter of Credit shall be issued
while a Stop Issuance Notice is in effect. The Majority Banks may request issuance of a Stop Issuance Notice
only if there is a reasonable basis therefor, and shall consider reasonably and in good faith a request from the
Company for withdrawal of the same on the basis that the conditions in Section 4.02 are satisfied;provided that
the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks may and shall conclusively rely upon any Stop Issuance Notice
while it remains in effect.
 (h) Other Documentation . If the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or
other agreement submitted by the Company to or entered into by the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit are not consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that, to the extent the Issuing Bank so agrees in such other documentation, its
liabilities and responsibilities in connection with a Letter of Credit may be governed thereby rather than by
clause(ii) of subsection(e) above, but such agreement by the Issuing Bank may not directly or indirectly alter
the rights and obligations of any other Bank under this Agreement.
SECTION 2.16.Currency Equivalents. (a) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Spot Rates as
of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Amount of Borrowings and Total Outstanding
Amounts denominated in Alternative Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such
Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable
currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by
the Company hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein,
the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such
Dollar Amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent.
(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or
prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is
expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Eurocurrency Rate Loan is denominated in an Alternative
Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to
the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the
Administrative Agent.
(c) The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the
Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter
related to the rates in the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate” and “Term SOFR”, or with respect to any rate that
is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any of such rate (including, without limitation, any
Successor Rate) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Conforming Changes.
 SECTION 2.17.Sustainability Adjustments. (a) Following the date on which the Company provides a
Pricing Certificate in respect of the most recently ended fiscal year, (i) the Applicable Margin and the Letter of
Credit Fee Rate shall be increased or decreased (or neither increased nor decreased), as applicable, pursuant to
the Sustainability Margin Adjustment as set forth in such Pricing Certificate and (ii) the applicable Facility Fee
Rate set forth in the Pricing Schedule shall be increased or decreased (or neither increased nor decreased), as
applicable, pursuant to the Sustainability Fee Adjustment as set forth in such Pricing Certificate. For purposes
of the foregoing, (A) the Sustainability Margin Adjustment and the Sustainability Fee Adjustment shall be
determined as of the fifth Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Pricing Certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(d) based upon the KPI Metrics set forth in such Pricing Certificate and the
calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment and the Sustainability Fee Adjustment, as applicable,
therein (such day, the “ Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date ”) and (B) each change in the Applicable
Margin, the Facility Fee Rate and the Letter of Credit Fee Rate resulting from a Pricing Certificate shall be
effective during the period commencing on and including the applicable Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date
and ending on the date immediately preceding the next such Sustainability Pricing Adjustment Date (or, in the
case of non-delivery of a Pricing Certificate, the last day such Pricing Certificate could have been delivered
pursuant to the terms of Section 6.02(d)).
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, only one Pricing Certificate may be delivered in respect of any fiscal
year. It is further understood and agreed that, subject to the second to last paragraph of Section 10.01, the
Applicable Margin and Letter of Credit Fee Rate will never be reduced or increased by more than 4.0 basis
points (such eight basis point spread, the “ Eight Basis Point Sustainability Margin Adjustment Spread ”)
pursuant to the Sustainability Margin Adjustment and that the Facility Fee Rate will never be reduced or
increased by more than 1.0 basis point (such two basis point spread, the “ Two Basis Point Sustainability Fee
Adjustment Spread ”) pursuant to the Sustainability Fee Adjustment, during any fiscal year. For the avoidance
of doubt, any adjustment to the Applicable Margin, Facility Fee Rate or Letter of Credit Fee Rate by reason of
meeting one or both KPI Metrics in any year shall not be cumulative year-over-year. Each applicable
adjustment shall only apply until the date on which the next Pricing Certificate is delivered or required to be
delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(d).
(c) It is hereby understood and agreed that if no such Pricing Certificate is delivered by the
Company by the time required pursuant to Section 6.02(d), (i) the Sustainability Fee Adjustment will be
positive 1.0 basis points and (ii) the Sustainability Margin Adjustment will be positive 4.0 basis points,
commencing on the last day such Pricing Certificate was required to have been delivered and continuing until
the Company delivers a Pricing Certificate for the applicable fiscal year to the Administrative Agent.
 
 
 (d) If (i)(A) the Company or any Bank becomes aware of any material inaccuracy in the
Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Fee Adjustment, or the KPI Metrics as reported in a
Pricing Certificate (any such material inaccuracy, a “ Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy ”) and, in the case of any
Bank, such Bank delivers, not later than 10 Business Days after obtaining knowledge thereof, a written notice to
the Administrative Agent describing such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy in reasonable detail (which description
shall be shared with each Bank and the Company), or (B) the Company and the Banks agree that there was a
Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy at the time of delivery of a Pricing Certificate, and (ii) a proper calculation of the
Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Fee Adjustment or the KPI Metrics would have resulted in
an increase in the Applicable Margin, the Facility Fee Rate or Letter of Credit Fee Rate for any applicable
period, the Company shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable
Banks promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry
of an order for relief with respect to the Company under the Bankruptcy Code (or any comparable event under
non-U.S. Debtor Relief Laws), automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any
Bank), but in any event within 10 Business Days after the Company has received written notice of, or has
agreed in writing that there was, a Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy, an amount equal to the excess of (1) the
amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over (2) the amount of interest and fees
actually paid for such period. If the Company becomes aware of any Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and, in
connection therewith, if a proper calculation of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Fee
Adjustment or the KPI Metrics would have resulted in a decrease in the Applicable Margin, the Facility Fee
Rate and the Letter of Credit Fee Rate for any period, then, upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of notice
from the Company of such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy (which notice shall include corrections to the
calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Fee Adjustment or the KPI Metrics, as
applicable), commencing on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the
Applicable Margin, the Facility Fee Rate and the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be adjusted to reflect the
corrected calculations of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Fee Adjustment or the KPI
Metrics, as applicable.
It is understood and agreed that any Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy with respect to any applicable period
shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default; provided, that, the Company complied with the terms of this
Section 2.17(d) with respect to such Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless such amounts shall be due upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief
with respect to the Company under the Bankruptcy Code (or any comparable event under non U.S. Debtor
Relief Laws), (a) any additional amounts required to be paid pursuant the immediate preceding paragraph shall
not be due and payable until a written demand is made for such payment by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with such paragraph, (b) any nonpayment of such additional amounts prior to or upon such demand
for payment by Administrative Agent shall not constitute a Default (whether retroactively or otherwise) and (c)
none of such additional amounts shall be deemed overdue prior to such a demand or shall accrue interest at the
Default Rate prior to such a demand. 
(e) Each party hereto hereby agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability
Coordinator shall have any responsibility for (or liability in respect of) reviewing, auditing or otherwise
evaluating any calculation by the Company of any Sustainability Margin Adjustment or any Sustainability Fee
Adjustment (or any of the data or computations that are part of or related to any such calculation) set forth in
any Pricing Certificate (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without
further inquiry).

withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and Agent, (i) such

the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) in the case of a Bank, U.S. federal withholding taxes
imposed on amounts payable to or for the account of such Bank pursuant to a law in effect on the date on which
the Bank acquires an interest in any Loan Document, except to the extent that, in the case of an assignment,
pursuant to this Section 3.01, amounts with respect to such taxes were payable to such Bank’s assignor
immediately before such Bank acquired such interest in any Loan Document, and (iii) any U.S. federal
withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities imposed on or with respect to any payment made by or on account of any obligation
of the Company under any Loan Document being hereinafter referred to as “ Taxes”).
(b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other

Taxes, it shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof.
(c) Subject to subsection 3.01(g), the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid by such Bank or Agent and any liability
(including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether

payment or liability.
(d) If the Company or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Company
under any Loan Document, then, subject to subsection 3.01(g):
(i) the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) have
been made, the applicable Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made;
(ii) the Company or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall make such deductions; and
(iii) the Company or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of Taxes or Other Taxes, the
Company shall furnish to the Administrative Agent evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative

Federal income tax purposes) agrees that, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so:
(i) it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party
hereto pursuant to Section 2.14 or10.09 after the Closing Date, the date upon which the Bank becomes a
party hereto) deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company through the Administrative Agent
two accurate and complete signed originals of (A) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any
successor thereto (“ Form W-8ECI”), (B) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or
any successor thereto (“ Form W-8BEN ”) and, in the case of a Bank claiming the benefits of the
exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, a certificate (a “ U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate ”) substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Bank is not a
“bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the
Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation”
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, or (C) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY or any
successor thereto (“ Form W-8IMY ”), accompanied by Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that
if the Bank is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Bank are claiming the
portfolio interest exemption, such Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in
the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner, as appropriate;
(ii) if at any time the Bank makes any changes necessitating a new Form W-8ECI, Form W-
8BEN or Form W-8IMY, it shall with reasonable promptness deliver to the Administrative Agent and
the Company through the Administrative Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the forms
previously delivered by it hereunder the applicable documentation specified in clause (i) of this
paragraph(f);
(iii) it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the passing of
time but excluding any event mentioned in clause (ii) above) requiring a change in or renewal of the
most recent Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN or Form W-8IMY previously delivered by such Bank,
deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company through the Administrative Agent two accurate
and complete original signed copies of Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN or Form W-8IMY (together with
the applicable supporting documentation specified in clause (i) of this paragraph (f)) in replacement for
the forms previously delivered by the Bank; and
(iv) it shall, promptly upon the Company’s or the Administrative Agent’s reasonable request
to that effect, deliver to the Company or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) such other forms
or similar documentation as may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or
regulation in order to establish such Bank’s tax status for withholding purposes; provided that it shall not
be required to provide such forms or documentation if in such Bank’s reasonable judgment, providing
such forms or documentation would subject the Bank to any material unreimbursed costs or expense or
would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank.
(g) The Company will not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States Taxes
pursuant to subsection 3.01(d) to any Bank for the account of any Lending Office of such Bank:
(i) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by
such Bank to comply with its obligations under subsection 3.01(f) in respect of such Lending Office;
 (ii) if such Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8ECI in respect of such
Lending Office pursuant to clause (i) or(ii) of subsection3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be
entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Taxes in respect of payments by
the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in
United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or regulations by any
governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having
the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8ECI; or
(iii) if the Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8BEN or Form W-8IMY in
respect of such Lending Office pursuant to clause (i) or(ii) of subsection3.01(f), and such Bank shall
not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Taxes in respect
of payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other
than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the
official interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by any governmental authority charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of
delivery of such Form W-8BEN or Form W-8IMY.
(h) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank or Agent pursuant to subsection
3.01(b) or3.01(d), then such Bank shall (at the request of the Company) use its reasonable best efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office or to take
other reasonable action so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may thereafter
accrue if such change or action in the judgment of such Bank, would not subject such Bank to any unreimbursed
cost or expense and is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with such designation.
(i) Any Bank that is a U.S. Person for United States Federal income tax purposes shall deliver to the
Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a party hereto (and
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent),
executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal
backup withholding.
(j) If any Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund
of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or with respect to which the
Company has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, then it shall pay over such refund to the
Company (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Company
under thisSection 3.01 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-
pocket expenses (including taxes) of such Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). The Company, upon the request of such Bank, shall repay
to such Bank the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such Bank is required to repay such refund
to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (j), in no event will
the Bank be required to pay any amount to the Company pursuant to this paragraph (j) the payment of which
would place the Bank in a less favorable net after-tax position than the Bank would have been in if the tax
subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification
payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph (j) shall not be
construed to require any Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes
that it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person.
 (k) If a payment made to a Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Taxes imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable),
such Bank shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may
be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA
and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (k), “FATCA” shall
include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
SECTION 3.02.Illegality.  (a) If any Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of
its counsel, that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law or in
the interpretation or administration thereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Lending Office to make
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Company through
the Administrative Agent, the obligation of that Bank to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans,
as applicable, shall be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Company
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
(b) If a Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of its counsel, that it is unlawful to
maintain any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, the Company shall prepay in full all Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued
thereon, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, together with any amounts required
to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.04.
(c) If the Company is required to prepay any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan
immediately as provided in subsection 3.02(b), then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company shall
borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.
(d) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans
has been suspended as provided in subsection 3.02(a), the Company may elect, by giving notice to the Bank
through the Administrative Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Bank as Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall be instead Base Rate Loans.
(e) Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02, the affected
Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR
Loans, as applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and
will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.
 SECTION 3.03.Increased Costs and Reduction of Return . (a) If any Bank shall determine that, due
to and as a direct result of any Change in Law (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in
reserve requirements included in the calculation of the Eurocurrency Rate), there shall be any increase in the
cost to such Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining its Revolving Commitment hereunder
or any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any imposition or increase in taxes,
any Loans) (including any imposition or increase in taxes (other than (x) withholding taxes imposed on or with
respect to any payment made by or on account of any obligation of the Company under any Loan Document or
(y) Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits,
reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto), or of agreeing to issue or participate in or issuing or
participating in any Letters of Credit, then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon
demand therefor by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such
Bank for such increased costs. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.03(a) does not apply to increased
costs as a result of (A) taxes described in Section 3.01(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), (B) Taxes as defined in Section 3.01(a),
or (C) Other Taxes.
(b) If any Bank shall have determined that any Change in Law affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank and
(taking into consideration such Bank’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and
liquidity and such Bank’s desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a
consequence of its Revolving Commitment, Loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement (including its
obligations in respect of Letters of Credit), then, upon demand of such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), the Company shall upon demand pay to such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increase.
(c) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to subsection 3.03(b)
or3.03(b), then such Bank shall (at the request of the Company) use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal
and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Eurocurrency Rate Loans
or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company, which
may thereafter accrue if such change in the judgment of such Bank, would not subject such Bank to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees
to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with any such designation.
(d) For purposes of this Section 3.03, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives
promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any
successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to
Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules,
guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation
thereof, shall be deemed to have been introduced and adopted after the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Bank shall be entitled to seek compensation for costs imposed pursuant to the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or Basel III if it shall not be the general policy of such Bank
at such time to seek compensation from other borrowers with the same or similar ratings under yield protection
provisions in credit agreements with such borrowers that provide for such compensation and the applicable
Bank is in fact generally seeking such compensation from such borrowers (and, upon any request by such Bank
for payment, certifies to the Company to the effect of the foregoing).
 (e) The Company shall pay to each Bank, (i) as long as such Bank shall be required to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently
known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency
Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Bank (as determined by
such Bank in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), and (ii) as long as such
Bank shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central
banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Revolving Commitments
or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards,
if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Revolving
Commitment or Loan by such Bank (as determined by such Bank in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such
Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least ten (10) days’ prior notice (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Bank. If a Bank fails to give notice ten
(10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10)
days from receipt of such notice.
SECTION 3.04.Funding Losses. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and to hold each Bank
harmless from any loss or out-of-pocket expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a direct consequence
of:
(a) the failure of the Company to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any
Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan (including payments made after any acceleration thereof);
(b) the failure of the Company to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after the Company has given (or
is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;
(c) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment after the Company has given a notice in
accordance with Section 2.06;
(d) any failure by the Company to make payment of any Loan or (or interest due thereon)
denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different
currency;
(e) any principal payment in respect of an Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan on a day
which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; or
(f) the conversion pursuant to Section 2.04 of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan to
a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the respective Interest Period; 
including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The
Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Bank in connection with the
foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this Section 3.04, each Bank
shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such
Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so
funded.
 SECTION 3.05.Inability to Determine Rates . 
(a) If the Administrative Agent shall have determined (i) that for any reason adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate or Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, or (ii) that the Eurocurrency
Rate or Term SOFR applicable pursuant to subsection 2.08(b) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to any Bank of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will forthwith give notice of such
determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or Term SOFR Loans hereunder, as applicable, shall be
suspended and (ii) each outstanding Loan in the affected currency shall be prepaid (or, in the case of a Dollar-
Denominated Loan, converted into a Base Rate Loan) on the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable thereto until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Company may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it.
If the Company does not revoke such notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed
by the Company, in the Dollar Amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Company, but such
Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurocurrency Rate Loans.
(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the
Company or Majority Banks notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Majority Banks, a copy to
the Company) that the Company or Majority Banks (as applicable) have determined, that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR because either
(x) none of the one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR is or (y) the Term
SOFR Screen Rate is not, in either case, available or published on a current basis and such
circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 
(ii) the CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with
respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public
statement identifying a specific date on which all tenors of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate
shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of
loans denominated in Dollars, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of
such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that
will continue to provide such interest period(s) of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate, in either
case, after such specific date (the latest date on which all tenors of the Term SOFR or Term SOFR
Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the “ Scheduled Term SOFR
Unavailability Date ”);
then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “ Term SOFR
Replacement Date ”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant Interest Payment
Date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the
Scheduled Term SOFR Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan
Document with Daily Simple SOFR for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by
the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other
party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “ Term SOFR Successor Rate” ).
If the Term SOFR Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly
basis.
  
 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple
SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of
the type described in Section 3.05(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Term SOFR Successor Rate
then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely
for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Term SOFR Successor Rate in accordance with
this Section 3.05 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant Interest Payment Date or payment period for interest
calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then
existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United
States for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to
such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar
denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the
avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a “ Term SOFR Successor Rate ”. 
Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after
the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Company unless,
prior to such time, Banks comprising the Majority Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written
notice that such Majority Banks object to such amendment.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the
Company or Majority Banks notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Majority Banks, a copy to
the Company) that the Company or Majority Banks (as applicable) have determined, that;
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate (other than
Term SOFR) for an Alternative Currency because none of the tenors of such Relevant Rate (other than
Term SOFR) under this Agreement is available or published on a current basis, and such circumstances
are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii) the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after
which all tenors of the Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) for an Alternative Currency under this
Agreement shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for
determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in such Alternative Currency, or shall or
will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor
administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such
representative tenor(s) of the Relevant Rate (other than Term SOFR) for such Alternative Currency (the
latest date on which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for such Alternative Currency under this Agreement
are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the “ Scheduled Unavailability
Date”);
  
 
 
 
 or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.05(c)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to
the Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement
solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for an Alternative Currency or any then current Successor
Rate for such Alternative Currency in accordance with this Section 3.05 with an alternative benchmark rate
giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and
agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Alternative Currency for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each
case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any
evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and
denominated in such Alternative Currency for such benchmarks (and any such proposed rate, including for the
avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a “ Non-Term SOFR Successor Rate ”, and collectively with the
Term SOFR Successor Rate, each a “ Successor Rate”), and any such amendment shall become effective at
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted
such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Company unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the
Majority Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Banks object to
such amendment.
(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Company and each
Bank of (i) the implementation of any Successor Rate and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in
connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Successor Rate.
(e) Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to
the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor
Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
(f) Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would
otherwise be less than 0%, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0% for the purposes of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.
(g) In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have
the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become
effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post
each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Company and the Banks reasonably
promptly after such amendment becomes effective.
SECTION 3.06.Certificates of Banks . Any Bank claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant to
thisArticle 3 shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis for and the computation of the amount payable to the Bank hereunder and such
certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Company in the absence of manifest error.
SECTION 3.07.Substitution of Banks . Upon (x) the receipt by the Company from any Bank of a notice
of illegality with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans pursuant to Section 3.02, (y) the
receipt by the Company from any Bank of a claim for additional amounts or compensation pursuant to Section
3.01 or3.03 or (z) any Bank becoming a Non-Consenting Bank, the Company may, upon notice to such Bank
and the Administrative Agent: (i) request one or more of the other Banks to acquire and assume all or part of
such Bank’s Loans and Revolving Commitment (but no other Bank shall be required to do so); or (ii) designate
a replacement bank meeting the qualifications of an Eligible Assignee; provided that in the case of clauses (i) or
(ii) in connection with an assignment resulting from a Bank becoming a Non-Consenting Bank, the applicable
assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. Any such transfer under clause
(i) or (ii) shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.04 and10.09 hereof.
 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.07 or Section 3.08 to the contrary, (i) any Bank that acts as
an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder
unless arrangements satisfactory to such Bank (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in
form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of
cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
such Issuing Bank) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (ii) the Bank that acts
as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of
Section 9.09.
SECTION 3.08.Defaulting Banks. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Bank is a
Defaulting Bank:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting
Bank pursuant to subsection 2.09(a);
(b) if any Letter of Credit Liabilities exist at the time such Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank then:
(i) the Letter of Credit Liabilities of such Defaulting Bank shall be reallocated among the
non-Defaulting Banks in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages but only to the
extent (x) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) the sum of each non-
Defaulting Bank’s Loans plus its Letter of Credit Liabilities does not exceed its Revolving Commitment;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected,
the Company shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash
collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank(s) only the Company’s obligations corresponding to
such Defaulting Bank’s Letter of Credit Liabilities (after giving effect to any partial reallocation
pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.03 for so long as
such Letter of Credit Liabilities remain outstanding;
(iii) if the Company cash collateralizes all or any portion of such Defaulting Bank’s Letter of
Credit Liabilities pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall not be required to pay any fees to
such Defaulting Bank pursuant to subsection 2.09(a) or2.09(c) with respect to such Defaulting Bank’s
Letter of Credit Liabilities during the period such Defaulting Bank’s Letter of Credit Liabilities are cash
collateralized;
(iv) if the Letter of Credit Liabilities of the Defaulting Banks are reallocated pursuant to
clause(i) above, then the fees payable to the Banks pursuant to subsections 2.09(a) and2.09(c) shall be
similarly reallocated to the same extent; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Bank’s Letter of Credit Liabilities is neither
reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or(ii) above, then, without prejudice to any
rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Bank hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise
would have been payable to such Defaulting Bank (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting
Bank’s Commitment that was utilized by such Letter of Credit Liabilities) and letter of credit fees
payable under subsection 2.09(c) with respect to such Defaulting Bank’s Letter of Credit Liabilities shall
be payable to the Issuing Bank(s) until and to the extent that such Letter of Credit Liabilities are
reallocated and/or cash collateralized;
 (c) so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or
increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Bank’s Letter of
Credit Liabilities then outstanding will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting
Banks and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with paragraph (b) above, and
participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting

under or in connection with, this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other
Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to

and their respective Affiliates and their and their respective Affiliates’ partners, directors, officers, employees,
agents, trustees, administrators, managers, advisors and representatives from all losses, costs, expenses and
liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Company. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it
deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority
Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the
Banks.
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Bank
that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied

acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to the Bank.

notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, unless

Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. In
the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice
thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as shall be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article 8;provided, however, that
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received any such request, the Administrative Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default
or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.
SECTION 9.06.Credit Decision. 
(a) Each Bank and each Issuing Bank expressly acknowledges that the Administrative Agent-Related
Persons, the Agents, the Sustainability Coordinator and the Lead Arrangers have not made any representation or
warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent-Related Persons, the Agents, the Sustainability
Coordinator or the Lead Arrangers hereafter taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment
or review of the affairs of the Company or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by Administrative Agent-Related Persons, the Agents, the Sustainability Coordinator
or the Lead Arrangers to any Bank or any Issuing Bank as to any matter, including whether the Administrative
Agent-Related Persons, the Agents, the Sustainability Coordinator and the Lead Arrangers have disclosed
material information in their (or their Related Parties’) possession. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank
represents to the Administrative Agent-Related Persons, the Agents, the Sustainability Coordinator and the
Lead Arrangers that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent-Related Persons,
the Agents, the Sustainability Coordinator, the Lead Arrangers, any other Bank or any of their respective
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory
laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement
and to extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent-Related Persons, the Agents, the
Sustainability Coordinator, the Lead Arrangers, any other Bank or any of their Related Parties and based on
such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank represents and
warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (ii) it is engaged
in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as
a Bank or Issuing Bank for the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other
facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Bank or Issuing Bank, and not for the purpose of
purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each Bank and each Issuing Bank
agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank represents and
warrants that it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to
provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Bank or such Issuing Bank, and either it, or
the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or
to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or
providing such other facilities.
 (b) Each Bank and each Issuing Bank further acknowledges that BofA Securities, Inc. is acting as
Sustainability Coordinator to the Company in connection with this Agreement. The Agents, the Sustainability
Coordinator and the Lead Arrangers, each acting in such capacities, make no any assurances as to (i) whether
the facilities under this Agreement meet any Bank’s criteria or expectations with regard to environmental
impact and sustainability performance, or (ii) whether the characteristics of the relevant key performance
indicators to which the Company will link a potential Applicable Margin step-up or step-down, including their
environmental and sustainability criteria, meet any industry standards for sustainability-linked credit facilities
and (b) each Bank should perform its own independent investigation and analysis of the facilities under this
Agreement and whether such facilities meet its own criteria or expectations with regard to environmental
impact and/or sustainability performance.
SECTION 9.07.Indemnification. The Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Administrative
Agent-Related Persons, the Sustainability Coordinator and any Issuing Bank (to the extent not reimbursed by or
on behalf of the Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably in accordance
with their respective Revolving Commitments, or if no Revolving Commitments are in effect, in accordance
with their respective outstanding Loans, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at
any time (including at any time following the repayment of the Loans and the termination or resignation of the
Administrative Agent) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any document contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by any such Person
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the
payment to the Administrative Agent-Related Persons or the Sustainability Coordinator of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to
the extent resulting from such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator and any Issuing
Bank upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs)
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or
legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein to the extent that the Administrative Agent is
not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other
jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or
for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly executed, or because
such Bank failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or
otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.07, together with all costs and expenses and attorneys’
fees (including Attorney Costs). A certificate as to the amount of such liability delivered to any Bank by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Bank hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank under any Loan
Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Bank from any source against any amount
due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.07. The obligation of the Banks in this Section 9.07 shall
survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder.
 SECTION 9.08. Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity . Bank of America and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such
Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent,
and the terms “Bank” and “Banks” shall include Bank of America in its individual capacity.
SECTION 9.09.Successor Administrative Agent . 
(a) The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days’ notice to the Banks.
If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Company shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks (unless an Event of Default then exists in which
case the Majority Banks shall appoint the successor agent). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Administrative Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Article 9 and Sections10.04 and10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it (i) while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and (ii) after such
resignation for as long as it continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
including in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor agent. If
no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a
retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is
appointed) and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time,
if any, as the Company or the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above.
(b) Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also
constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank. If Bank of America resigns as Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit
outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Bank and all Letter of Credit Liabilities with
respect thereto, including the right to require the Banks to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in
Reimbursement Obligations pursuant to Section 2.15(c). Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor
Issuing Bank and the acceptance of such appointment by the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder (which
successor shall in all cases be a Bank other than a Defaulting Bank), (a) such successor shall succeed to and
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, (b) the retiring
Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of
Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of
America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit.
 SECTION 9.10.Lead Arrangers, Sustainability Coordinator and Other Agents . Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, none of the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents or the
Sustainability Coordinator listed on the cover page hereof shall have any obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty under this Agreement other than those in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Bank or
Issuing Bank hereunder. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Syndication
Agent, the Documentation Agents or Sustainability Coordinator in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder. The Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents
and Sustainability Coordinator shall have the express benefit of this Section 9.10 and Sections10.05 and10.07.

(a) Each Bank (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Bank party hereto, to,
and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Bank party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a

administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Revolving Commitments and
this Agreement; or
(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between
the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Bank.

Affiliates are not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Bank involved in such Bank’s entrance into,
participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and
this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
SECTION 9.12. Recovery of Erroneous Payments. Without limitation of any other provision in this
Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Bank (the
“Credit Party”), whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by the Company at such time, where
such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Credit Party receiving a Rescindable
Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount
received by such Credit Party in immediately available funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Credit Party
irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any “discharge for value” (under which a creditor might
otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or
similar defense to its obligation to return any Rescindable Amount. The Administrative Agent shall inform
each Credit Party promptly upon determining that any payment made to such Credit Party comprised, in whole
or in part, a Rescindable Amount.

the substance of Section 2.17) in a manner that does not increase the Sustainability Spread Adjustments;
provided that such amendment shall become effective fifteen (15) Business Days after such amendment is

Company, acting together, identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any

provided in sub clause (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such clause (b).
(b) Electronic Communications . Notices and other communications to the Banks and the Issuing

messaging, and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent;
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Bank or Issuing Bank pursuant to Article 2 if such
Bank has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by
electronic communication. The Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or the Company may each, in its
discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications
pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular
notices or communications.

account of any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such
telephonic, facsimile or other electronic notice. The obligation of the Company to repay the Loans shall not be
affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to receive written
confirmation of any telephonic, facsimile or other electronic notice or the receipt by the Administrative Agent
and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by the Administrative Agent
and the Banks to be contained in the telephonic, facsimile or other electronic notice.

COMPANY MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE COMPANY MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD

any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) arising out of the Company’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of Company Materials or
notices through the platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the
Internet.
SECTION 10.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising,
on the part of any Agent or Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
SECTION 10.04. Costs and Expenses . The Company shall, whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated:
(a) pay or reimburse Bank of America (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) within
fifteen Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.01(e)) for all reasonable, demonstrable costs and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Bank of America (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) in
connection with the development, preparation, delivery and execution of, and any amendment, supplement,
waiver or modification to (in each case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document
and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by Bank of
America (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) with respect thereto as agreed in the Fee Letters;
and
(b) pay or reimburse each Bank and the Administrative Agent within fifteen Business Days after
demand (subject to subsection 4.01(e)) for all costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the
enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies (including in connection with
any “workout” or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate
proceeding) under this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, and any such other
documents, including Attorney Costs incurred by the Administrative Agent and any Bank or Issuing Bank.
 SECTION 10.05. Indemnity.  (a) The Company shall pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank, Agent,
Lead Arranger and the Sustainability Coordinator and each of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an “ Indemnified Person ”) harmless from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, investigations, costs,
charges, expenses or disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to
the preparation, execution, delivery, modification, amendment, enforcement, performance and administration of
this Agreement, any Letter of Credit and any other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency
Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to this Agreement, the Loans, any Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto and whether such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company or any other party (all the foregoing, collectively, the
“Indemnified Liabilities ”);provided that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent resulting from (i) the gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
and non-appealable judgment, (ii) a claim brought by the Company against an Indemnified Person for a material
breach of such Indemnified Person’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Company
has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction or (iii) a claim not involving an act or omission of the Company and that is brought by an
Indemnified Person against another Indemnified Person (other than against the Sustainability Coordinator, Lead
Arrangers or the Agents in their capacities as such). The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive payment
of all other Obligations and termination of this Agreement. This Section 10.05 shall not apply with respect to
taxes other than any taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-tax claim.
(b) An Indemnified Person shall give prompt notice to the Company of any claim asserted in writing,
or the commencement of any action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder;
provided that the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability, if any,
which it may have to the Indemnified Person otherwise than under subsection 10.05(a) unless and to the extent
that the Company shall have been damaged by the delay in notification or the failure to be notified.
(c) The Indemnified Person shall assist the Company in the defense of any such action or proceeding
by arranging discussions with (and the calling as witnesses of) relevant officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Indemnified Person and providing reasonable access to relevant books and records. The Company
shall have the right to, and shall at the request of the Indemnified Person, participate in, and assume the defense
of, any such action or proceeding at its own expense using counsel mutually acceptable to the Company and the
Indemnified Person. In any such action or proceeding which the Company has participated in or assumed the
defense of, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain separate counsel, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at its own expense unless the named parties to any such suit, action or proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the Indemnified Person and representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them it being understood and agreed that the Company shall not have liability for the fees and expenses of more
than one firm (in addition to local counsel) which shall be retained to act in such circumstances for all of the
Indemnified Parties; provided, however,that the Company shall have the liability for the fees and expenses of
more than one firm if such firm or firms has or have been retained due to actual or potential differing interests
among the Indemnified Parties.
 (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Section 10.05 for any settlement effected without its
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of any claim, litigation or proceeding in
respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder. The Company may settle any claim without the consent
of the Indemnified Person if monetary damages are paid in full by the Company; provided that the Company
shall not make any admission of wrongdoing by such Indemnified Person and all claimants shall execute a full
release in favor of such Indemnified Person. An Indemnified Person shall, subject to its reasonable business
needs, use reasonable efforts to minimize the indemnification sought from the Company under this Section
10.05.
SECTION 10.06. Marshalling; Payments Set Aside . Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Banks
shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the Company or any other Person or against or in
payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to the
Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their rights of set-off,
and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into
by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Banks) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Bank
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its ratable share of the total amount so
recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 10.07. No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, each Bank, each Lead Arranger, the Sustainability
Coordinator and their respective Affiliates (each, a “ Bank Party”) may have economic interests that conflict
with those of the Company. The Company agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the
Bank Parties and the Company, its stockholders or Affiliates. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the
Bank Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, (ii) in connection therewith and with the
process leading to such transactions, each Bank Party is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or
fiduciary of the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person, (iii) no Bank Party has
assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or in any other Loan Document or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any
Bank Party or any of its Affiliates has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any
other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (iv) the
Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company
further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to
such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Company agrees that it will not claim that any Bank
Party has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the
Company, its stockholder or Affiliates, in connection with such transactions or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 10.08. Successors and Assigns . The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except
that the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Bank (and any attempted assignment or transfer by
the Company without such consent shall be null and void).
 
 
 
 SECTION 10.09. Assignments, Participations, Etc . 
(a) Any Bank may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment, Letter of Credit Liabilities and the
Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Bank’s Revolving Commitment, Letter of Credit Liabilities and the Loans at the time owing to
it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund with
respect to a Bank, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in clause (a)(i)(A) of this Section 10.09, the amount of
the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans and Letter of Credit
Liabilities outstanding thereunder) or, if the Revolving Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Bank subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000,
unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect
to the Loans, the Letter of Credit Liabilities and/or the Revolving Commitment assigned.
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent
required by clause (a)(i)(B) of this Section 10.09 and, in addition:
(A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an
Approved Fund; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such
assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within
five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments to a Person that is not a Bank, an
Affiliate of such Bank or an Approved Fund with respect to such Bank; and
(C) the consent of each Issuing Bank shall be required for any assignment.
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500 ( provided,however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment), and the Eligible
Assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire. 
 
 (v) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and
obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in
addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such
additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or
subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company
and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not
funded by the Defaulting Bank, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting
Bank to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or any Bank hereunder (and interest accrued thereon)
and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters
of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of
any Defaulting Bank hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with
the provisions of this clause (v), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Bank for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
(vi) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection0, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Bank’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01,3.03,10.04, and10.05 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Bank will constitute a
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Bank’s having been a Defaulting
Bank). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(b) No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank
hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person
(or to a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a
natural Person). Each assignee shall be capable of making Loans hereunder in Dollars or any Alternative
Currency.
 (c) Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company, the Administrative Agent or
the Issuing Banks, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “ Participant”) in all or a portion
of such Bank’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving
Commitment, the Loans and/or the Letter of Credit Liabilities at the time owing to it); providedthat (i) such
Bank’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible
to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such
Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank
sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; providedthat such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a),(b) or(c) ofSection 10.01 that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 3.01,3.02,3.03 and3.04 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section.
(d) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or3.03 than
the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that
occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with subsection 3.01(f) as though it were a Bank (it being
understood that the documentation required under subsection 3.01(f) shall be delivered to the participating
Bank). Each Bank that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the
Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal
amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register ”);provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any
portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such
commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including without limitation any pledge or assignment
to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Bank as a party hereto.
SECTION 10.10. Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and
exercise due care (in the same manner as it exercises for its own affairs) to maintain the confidentiality of all
information identified as “confidential” by the Company and provided to it by the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company, or by the Administrative Agent on such Company’s or Subsidiary’s behalf, in connection with
this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall
use any such information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms contemplated by
this Agreement; except to the extent such information:
 (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
such Bank, or 
(ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Company;provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company
known to such Bank; and, provided, further, that any Bank may disclose such information:
(A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of (1) any Governmental Authority
to which such Bank or its Affiliates are subject or in connection with an examination of such
Bank or its Affiliates by any such authority and (2) any self-regulatory body having or claiming
oversight over any Bank or any of its Affiliates;
(B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; provided that the Company is given
prompt notice of such subpoena or other process (unless such Bank is legally prohibited from
giving such notice);
(C) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable
Requirement of Law;
(D) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding
to which any Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party;
(E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder or under any other Loan Document; 
(F) to any other party hereto;
(G) with the consent of the Company; and
(H) to such Bank’s and its Affiliates’ agents, independent auditors and other
professional advisors as may be reasonably required in order for any party to fulfill its
obligations;provided that such auditors or advisors shall be informed of the confidentiality
requirements of this Agreement and instructed to keep such information confidential.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant or
Eligible Assignee (each, a “ Transferee”) and to any prospective Transferee or to any actual or prospective
contractual counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, hedge or other derivative transaction, such
financial and other information in such Bank’s possession concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries which
has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks pursuant to this Agreement or which has been
delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by the Company in connection with the Bank’s credit
evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this Agreement; providedthat, unless otherwise agreed by the
Company, such Person agrees in writing to such Bank to keep such information confidential on terms no less
restrictive than the provisions hereunder or to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any party hereto (and any employee, representative or other agent of thereof)
may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and
the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
However, no disclosure of any information relating to such tax treatment or tax structure may be made to the
extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.
  In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may disclose the existence of this Agreement and
customary information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending
industry, service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Banks in connection with the administration and
management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Revolving Commitments and to any credit

Fee Letters, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company, the Banks and the Agents,

allow such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Company in accordance with the
Patriot Act.
SECTION 10.22. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject
to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to,
and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority
to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected
Financial Institution; and
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of
ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may
be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will

SECTION 10.23. Judgment Currency . If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency,
the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding
that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Company in respect of any such sum due from it to
the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “ Agreement Currency ”), be discharged only
to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case
may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as
the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with
the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally
due to the Administrative Agent or any Bank from the Company in the Agreement Currency, the Company
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent
or such Bank, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is
greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Bank in such currency, the
Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the
Company (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
 SECTION 10.24. Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the
maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the “ Maximum Rate”). If the
Administrative Agent or any Bank shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to
the Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Bank exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
(a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest,
(b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations
hereunder.
SECTION 10.25. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan
Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or
instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC Credit Support ”, and each such QFC, a “ Supported QFC ”),
the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special
Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be
governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United
States): 
(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party”)
becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC
and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC
and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit
Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under
the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest,
obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under
a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to
such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the
United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Bank shall in no event affect the rights of any
Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b) As used in this Section 10.25, the following terms have the following meanings:

with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
 “QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
“Swap Contract” means (a) any and all rate swap transactions, basis swaps, credit derivative
transactions, forward rate transactions, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward commodity
contracts, equity or equity index swaps or options, bond or bond price or bond index swaps or options or
forward bond or forward bond price or forward bond index transactions, interest rate options, forward

transactions or any combination of any of the foregoing (including any options to enter into any of the
foregoing), whether or not any such transaction is governed by or subject to any master agreement, and
(b) any and all transactions of any kind, and the related confirmations, which are subject to the terms and
conditions of, or governed by, any form of master agreement published by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, Inc., any International Foreign Exchange Master Agreement, or any other
