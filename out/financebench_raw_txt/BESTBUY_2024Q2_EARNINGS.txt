“Today we are reporting second quarter sales results that are at the high-end of the outlook we shared in May and 
profitability that was better than expectations,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “These results continue to 
demonstrate our strong operational execution as we balance our reaction to the current industry sales pressure 
with our ongoing strategic investments.” 
 
“Our financial results were better than expected, and they reflect a consumer electronics industry that remains 
challenged due to the pull-forward of demand in prior years and the various macroeconomic factors that we are all 
too familiar with,” Barry continued. “With that said, we continue to expect that this year will be the low point in tech 
demand after two years of sales declines. Next year the consumer electronics industry should see stabilization and 
possibly growth driven by the natural upgrade and replacement cycles and the normalization of tech innovation. I 
am very proud of the way our teams are managing the business and preparing for our future, and we remain 
incredibly excited about our future opportunities.”

 FY24 Financial Guidance 
 
“In May, we noted that we were preparing for a number of scenarios within our annual guidance range, and we 
believed our sales were aligning closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance,” said Matt 
Bilunas, Best Buy CFO. “Today we are lowering the high-end of our full year revenue outlook to our previous 
midpoint, while keeping the low-end of our revenue guidance unchanged. At the same time, we are narrowing our 
profitability ranges, effectively raising the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for non-GAAP operating income 
rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS.”  
 
Bilunas continued, “As it relates specifically to the third quarter, we expect our comparable sales to be slightly better 
than the negative 6.2% we reported for the second quarter and our non-GAAP operating income rate to be 
approximately 3.4%.”  
 
Best Buy’s guidance for FY24, which includes 53 weeks, is the following: 
 
 Revenue of $43.8 billion to $44.5 billion, which compares to prior guidance of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion 
 Comparable sales decline of 4.5% to 6.0%, which compares to prior guidance of a decline of 3.0% to 6.0%  
 Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate2 of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to prior guidance of 3.7% 
to 4.1%   
 Non-GAAP effective income tax rate2 of approximately 24.5%, which remains unchanged 
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS2 of $6.00 to $6.40, which compares to prior guidance of $5.70 to $6.50 
 Capital expenditures of approximately $850 million, which remains unchanged 
 
Note: Incorporated in the above guidance, the 53rd week is expected to add approximately $700 million of revenue 
to Q4 FY24 and provide a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to the company’s full year non-GAAP operating 
income rate.2   
 
Domestic Segment Q2 FY24 Results 
 
Domestic Revenue 
Domestic revenue of $8.89 billion decreased 7.1% versus last year primarily driven by a comparable sales decline 
of 6.3%. 
 
From a merchandising perspective, the largest drivers of the comparable sales decline on a weighted basis were 
appliances, home theater, computing and mobile phones. These drivers were partially offset by growth in gaming. 
 
Domestic online revenue of $2.76 billion decreased 7.1% on a comparable basis, and as a percentage of total 
Domestic revenue, online revenue was flat to last year at 31.0%.   
 
Domestic Gross Profit Rate 
Domestic gross profit rate was 23.1% versus 22.0% last year. The higher gross profit rate was primarily due to: (1) 
favorable product margin rates; (2) improved financial performance from the comp any’s membership offerings, 
which included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to the 
company’s free membership offering; and (3) an improved gross profit rate from the company’s Health initiatives.  
 
Domestic Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) 
Domestic GAAP SG&A was $1.73 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, versus $1.73 billion, or 18.1% of revenue, last year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A was $1.71 billion, or 19.2% of revenue, versus $1.71 billion, or 17.9% of revenue, 
 
 
 
 
3 
 last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation 
was primarily offset by reduced store payroll expense.  
 
International Segment Q2 FY24 Results 
 
International revenue of $693 million decreased 8.8% versus last year. This decrease was primarily driven by a 
comparable sales decline of 5.4% and the negative impact of approximately 340 basis points from foreign currency 
exchange rates.  
 
International operating income was $19 million, or 2.7% of revenue, compared to $28 million, or 3.7% of revenue, 
last year. The lower operating income rate was primarily driven by SG&A deleverage on lower revenue, which was 
partially offset by an improvement in the company’s gross profit rate of approximately 80 basis points compared to 
last year. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The Q2 FY24 GAAP effective tax rate was 26.1% versus 15.6% last year. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax 
rate was 26.6% versus 16.7% last year. The lower GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates last year were primarily 
due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. 
 
Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 
In Q2 FY24, the company returned a total of $279 million to shareholders through dividends of $200 million and 
share repurchases of $79 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has returned a total of $560 million to 
shareholders through dividends of $402 million and share repurchases of $158 million.  
 
Today, the company announced that its board of directors has authorized the payment of a regular quarterly cash 
dividend of $0.92 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 10, 2023, to shareholders of 
record as of the close of business on September 19, 2023. 
 
Conference Call 
 
Best Buy is scheduled to conduct an earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Central Time) 
on August 29, 2023. A webcast of the call is expected to be available at www.investors.bestbuy.com , both live and 
after the call. 
 
Notes: 
(1) The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of 
calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on 
comparable sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports 
on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and available at 
www.investors.bestbuy.com . 
 
(2) A reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP operating income rate, non-GAAP effective income tax rate and non-
GAAP diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable 
GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without 
unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty 
predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be 
recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; price -fixing 
settlements; goodwill impairments; gains and losses on sales of subsidiaries and certain investments;  intangible 
asset amortization; certain acquisition -related costs; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company 
has excluded these items from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to 
exclude these items in future disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that 
 
 
 
 
4 
 may arise (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of 
non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, 
are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

(including, but not limited to, cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters); risks arising from 
our international activities (including those related to the conflict in Ukraine or fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates) and those of our vendors; failure to effectively manage our costs; our dependence on cash flow s 
and net earnings generated during the fourth fiscal quarter; pricing investments and promotional activity; economic 
or regulatory developments that might affect our ability to provide attractive promotional financing; constraints in the 
capital markets; changes to our vendor credit terms; changes in our credit ratings; failure to meet financial -
performance guidance or other forward- looking statements; and general economic uncertainty in key global markets

important factors is not complete. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we 
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that we may make.

 BEST BUY CO., INC. 
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
($ in millions, except per share amounts) 
(Unaudited and subject to reclassification) 
 
The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP financial measures) to presented non-GAAP financial measures. 
The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can 
provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For 
these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, presented non-GAAP 
financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, 
price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on subsidiaries and certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain 
acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP 
financial measures when the company believes this provides greater clarity to management and investors. These non-GAAP 
financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures 
presented in this earnings release and the company’s financial statements and other publicly filed reports. Non-GAAP financial 
measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(1) Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, 
tradenames and developed technology assets.  
(2) Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention 
related to previously planned organizational changes.  
(3) Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico. 
(4) The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-
GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-
GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.

 Return on Assets and Non-GAAP Return on Investment 
 
The tables below provide calculations of return on assets ("ROA") (GAAP financial measure) and non-GAAP return on 
investment (“ROI”) (non-GAAP financial measure) for the periods presented. The company believes ROA is the most directly 
comparable financial measure to ROI. Non-GAAP ROI is defined as non-GAAP adjusted operating income after tax divided by 
average invested operating assets. All periods presented below apply this methodology consistently. The company believes non-
GAAP ROI is a meaningful metric for investors to evaluate capital efficiency because it measures how key assets are deployed 
by adjusting operating income and total assets for the items noted below. This method of determining non-GAAP ROI may differ 
from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.

(1) Income statement accounts represent the activity for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. Balance sheet 
accounts represent the average account balances for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. 
(2) Non-GAAP operating income adjustments include continuing operations adjustments for intangible asset amortization and restructuring 
charges. Additional details regarding these adjustments are included in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule 
within the company’s earnings releases. 
(3) Operating lease interest represents the add-back to operating income to approximate the total interest expense that the company would 
incur if its operating leases were owned and financed by debt. The add-back is approximated by multiplying average operating lease assets 
by 4%, which approximates the interest rate on the company’s operating lease liabilities. 
(4) Income taxes are approximated by using a blended statutory rate at the Enterprise level based on statutory rates from the countries in 
which the company does business, which primarily consists of the U.S. with a statutory rate of 24.5% for the periods presented. 
(5) Operating lease amortization represents operating lease cost less operating lease interest. Operating lease cost includes short-term leases, 
which are immaterial, and excludes variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease asset balance. 
(6) Excess cash represents the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments greater than $1 billion, which approximates the 
amount of cash the company believes is necessary to run the business and may fluctuate over time. 
(7) Accumulated depreciation and amortization represents accumulated depreciation related to property and equipment and accumulated 
amortization related to definite-lived intangible assets. 
(8) Adjusted current liabilities represent total current liabilities less short-term debt and the current portions of operating lease liabilities and 
long-term debt .
