PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the 
FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business 
services, offering integrated business solutions through operating companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one 
FedEx. These companies are included in the following reportable business segments:  
 
•    FedEx Express: Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”) is the world’s largest express transportation company, offering time-definite 
delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. 
 
•    FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”) is a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery 
services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the U.S. and Canada, as well as residential delivery to 100% of 
U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. FedEx Ground Economy specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of 
low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages. 
 
•    FedEx Freight: FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”) is a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight 
transportation services across all lengths of haul to businesses and residences. Within the contiguous U.S., FedEx Freight offers FedEx Freight Priority, 
when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx 
Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for 
residences and businesses. FedEx Freight also offers freight delivery service to most points in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 
•    FedEx Services: FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”) provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer 
service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. 
 
The FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) operating segment is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our 
customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. (“ShopRunner”) was merged into FedEx Dataworks during 2023. Additionally, the FedEx Office and Print 
Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses and the 
FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment provides customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding through FedEx Trade 
Networks Transport & Brokerage, Inc. (“FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage”) and integrated supply chain management solutions through FedEx 
Supply Chain Distribution System, Inc. (“FedEx Supply Chain”). FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics are included in “Corporate, other, and 
eliminations” in our segment reporting. For more information about FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics, please see “FedEx Dataworks 
Operating Segment,” “FedEx Office Operating Segment,” and “FedEx Logistics Operating Segment.”

Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced. References to our transportation segments 
include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.
 
One FedEx and Network 2.0
 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced “one FedEx”, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other 
FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the 
respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal 
Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate 
our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx 
picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. 
 
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel 
in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers. See 
“Business Segments” below, “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” 
of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE.
 
Strategy 
 
The collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the long-term best interest of 
the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return 
on capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings 
performance and cash flow. Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and 
customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and evolution have 
become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.
 
Over the last 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the 
changing needs of our customers and the market. We made significant investments in our service network in recent years to build out our infrastructure and 
services to meet increased e-commerce demand. Through one FedEx and Network 2.0, we are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers 
with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength 
of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach 
to how we move packages on the ground.
 
Innovation inspired our start at FedEx 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of 
FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve 
our operational efficiency by optimizing our existing physical capacity and staffing. See “Business Segments” below for more information. Additionally, the 
size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use 
to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offering. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is 
focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers’ supply chains, as well as the end-to-end 
experience of our customers. 
 
“Safety Above All” is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our 
team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, 
and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.
 
Through our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer 
access — to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which 
reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world’s largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world’s gross 
domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, 
productivity, and profitability.

During 2023 and early 2024, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other 
important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including:
 
•    Launching DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the 
efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.
 
•    Announcing one FedEx, our consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating 
companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network.
 
•    Expanding Picture Proof of Delivery to 90% of global residential deliveries.
 
•    Improving service at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground through the reopening and completion of intra-European road hubs and continued 
enhancements to route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies.
 
•    Offering FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, customer-friendly e-commerce returns option facilitated through supply chain 
services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office.
 
•    Introducing FedEx Sustainability Insights in the U.S., a cloud-based engine that harnesses scan data from our global logistics network to enhance 
customer access to emissions information.
 
•    Exceeding our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th anniversary in April 2023.
Reputation and Responsibility 
 
FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many 
reputation awards we received during 2023, FedEx ranked 18th  in FORTUNE magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies” list — the 23rd consecutive year 
FedEx has ranked among the top 20 in the FORTUNE Most Admired Companies list, with 15 of those years ranking among the top 10. We also retained our 
position as the highest ranked delivery company on the “World’s Most Admired Companies” list. Additionally, in 2023 Ethisphere, a global leader in defining 
and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, named FedEx as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies®. 
 
Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, in 2023 FedEx 
was named the 21st best workplace overall in FORTUNE magazine’s list of the “World’s Best Workplaces.” 
 
The success of our efforts is built on our sound ESG practices, which are aligned with our strategic focus. Our 2023 ESG Report is available at fedex.com/en-
us/sustainability/reports.html. This report details progress toward our ESG strategies, goals, and initiatives and our approach toward industry leadership in ESG 
to support our strategy and values. Information in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.
 
We remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., this includes seeking diverse 
suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority-, and women-owned businesses. We are also proud of our long-standing history 
of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are working to make our society more equitable and just, such as the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People and the National Civil Rights Museum. 
Human Resource Management
 
Our Culture
 
At FedEx, it is our people—our greatest asset—that stand at the heart of our success and are the foundation of our strong reputation. Our exemplary human 
network defines who we are and what kind of business we want to be. Ultimately, our success depends on our people’s talent, dedication, and well-being. We 
strive to recruit, retain, develop, and support our team members as we grow globally. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of 
Directors reviews and discusses with management our key human resource management strategies and programs, including company culture and diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (“DEI”).
- 4 -
 
 
Throughout our 50-year history, the FedEx culture has driven our success. Our five culture values—take care of each other, commit to do good, drive business 
results, own outstanding, and create what’s next—unify all our operating companies and empower us to support our strategy and values. These values are 
grounded in our Quality Driven Management system, the Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding, and our People–Service–Profit 
philosophy, which we bring to life by: 
 
•     Prioritizing safety.
•     Taking care of our team members.
•     Embracing DEI so everyone feels appreciated and valued.
•     Delivering excellence and value for our customers and stockholders.
•     Acting with integrity in all that we do.
•     Supporting our communities.
•     Helping shape a better world.
•     Growing profitably to reinvest in our team members and business.
Ultimately, our success depends on the talent, dedication, and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, develop, and provide 
advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make FedEx an inclusive, equitable, and growth-focused workplace where all team 
members have the opportunity to flourish.
 
Health and Safety
 
Our highest priority is the well-being, health, and safety of all our employees. Our “Safety Above All” philosophy is the first and foremost value in every aspect 
of our business and is key to maintaining a successful and safe business. Our detailed safety policies, education, and technology investments are embedded into 
our day-to-day work and help us follow through on our commitment to make our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and 
communities. The Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety strategies, policies, programs, and practices. 
 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Creates Opportunity
 
We believe that DEI delivers a better future for all team members, customers, suppliers, and communities. As a 
global business, we value the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of our people and 
recognize DEI is essential to our success and the communities we serve. DEI fosters collaboration, enables us 
to recruit, retain, and develop a talented workforce, and underpins our business performance and sustainability. 
The continued integration of DEI into our business strategies and progress towards our DEI objectives 
supported our ability to respond to the challenging labor market our industry faced in recent years.
 
FedEx has a long-standing commitment to fully embrace DEI throughout our organization, from the Board of 
Directors to every employee. This commitment is communicated through our DEI framework and four strategic 
pillars: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our 
Story. We continue to roll out programs to ensure our people are engaged and can develop at FedEx. The FedEx 
Ground workforce career track program, Purple Pathways, directly targets our most diverse population, 
frontline managers and package handlers, to support their career growth.
 
To further our transparency efforts regarding our workforce composition, we report the prior year’s gender, 
racial, and ethnic composition of our U.S. workforce by EEO-1 job category, as set forth in the consolidated 
EEO-1 Reports filed by FedEx and its operating subsidiaries with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. These reports can be found on our DEI webpage at fedex.com/en-us/about/diversity-
inclusion.html.
 
Quality of Life
 
To support the well-being of our employees and their families, we provide the resources they need to thrive at 
work and at home. All eligible full- and part-time team members are equipped with competitive benefits, 
including healthcare, wellness, paid sick leave, other flexible paid time off, and other benefits. To ensure our 
benefits and compensation stay competitive, we conduct periodic peer benchmarking and internal pay equity 
analyses.
 
 
- 5 -
 
 
All eligible full- and part-time employees and their eligible dependents receive competitive health benefits. In the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of total 
eligible health and disability costs at the plan level for approximately 212,000 participating employees as of May 2023. Additionally, we offer competitive time-
off that is based on feedback from our team members about what is important to them, and provide 24/7 confidential counseling services to support the mental 
health and well-being of our employees and their household members. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to 
promote their use across the enterprise, with an increased focus on mental health resources in recent years.
 
Learning and Development
 
At FedEx, we are committed to helping our team members grow and further develop their careers. We proactively evolve our operating companies’ learning 
frameworks to meet emerging trends and align existing competencies to future capabilities and skillsets to future-proof talent needs. Our learning and 
development opportunities increase team member engagement, improve retention, and enhance the employee value proposition. Across the enterprise, we tailor 
our Core New Employee Orientation to best fit team member responsibilities in their local workplace. This onboarding experience covers topics such as safety, 
security, compliance, sustainability, and DEI. After orientation, the FedEx Learning Center is available with more than 25,000 online courses to enable a more 
efficient and convenient learning experience.
 
We are committed to supporting team members who wish to pursue higher education in a variety of ways. The Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE) program — a 
partnership between multiple FedEx operating companies and The University of Memphis—offers a suite of education benefits, including tuition-free, fully 
online degree options for over 30 associate’s and bachelor’s programs of study. Eligible employees include all FedEx Express employees at all hub and airport 
locations in the U.S. as well as all U.S.-based FedEx Logistics and FedEx Freight employees and all Memphis-based FedEx Supply Chain employees. In 2022, 
we expanded the LiFE program to include all majors The University of Memphis offers online and added mentoring opportunities. We are exploring 
opportunities to implement similar programs outside the U.S.
 
Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Turnover
 
Our recruiting practices enable us to build a talented employee base representative of the communities we serve. We continue to refine our approach to talent 
acquisition through technology and other human resource management strategies, leveraging technology to make our hiring process more efficient. We value 
feedback from our team members and provide several avenues of engagement, such as annual surveys, employee networks, and direct feedback. These methods 
allow us to better understand employee concerns and expectations, and results from these engagements inform our future strategies. Annually, we conduct an 
engagement survey to measure employee insights on our culture, engagement, and diversity.
 
We work to provide employees with flexible work structures. Depending on the operating company and team member responsibilities, we use a flexible work 
model that allows our people to work in ways that make the most sense to them. We are constantly monitoring and adjusting our strategy as we learn of new 
developments and use survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels to inform our strategy. 
 
Globally, in 2022, we hired over 558,000 full- and part-time team members. Turnover for part-time team members, primarily package handlers at our sorting 
locations, was 205%, while full-time team member turnover was 32% in 2023. Turnover rates among part-time frontline workers in a number of industries are 
historically higher than among other employee groups. Within the ground transportation industry, many part-time workers pursue temporary employment 
opportunities that allow them to exit and re-enter the workforce more frequently based on their needs. These traditionally higher rates have recently been further 
exacerbated by the highly competitive labor market.
 
Other Information
 
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx employed approximately 328,000 permanent full-time and approximately 201,000 permanent part-time employees, and FedEx 
Ground utilized nearly 7,000 contracted service providers.
 
The pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”) and are 
employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for 
a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 
2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive 
Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express’s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no 
effect on our operations.

A small number of our other employees are members of unions. For additional information, see “FedEx Express Segment” and “Regulation” below and “Item 
1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Our Community 
 
FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources, and network. 
Through FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, we support non-profit organizations working to solve social challenges relevant to our 
business, customers, and team members. We pair donations with charitable shipping and access to our global network, team member volunteers, subject matter 
expertise, influence, and connections to meet social and business goals. We make our biggest investments in areas where we can address significant issues and 
apply our unique business capabilities. Real change takes significant investment, authentic support for communities, and a commitment to continuous learning. 
FedEx Cares focuses on three major giving pillars:
 
•   Delivering for Good: Lending our global network and unparalleled logistics expertise to organizations with mission-critical needs in times of disaster 
and helping communities heal, learn, and thrive. 
 
•    Global Entrepreneurship: Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses globally through training and increased access to resources, 
capital, and new markets.
 
•    Sustainable Logistics: Accelerating process innovations such as public transportation and technological innovations such as natural carbon capture 
and clean energy to reduce the environmental impact of the logistics industry. 
 
Additionally, our commitments to DEI and team member volunteerism are foundational to FedEx Cares.
 
In 2023 we exceeded our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th anniversary in April 2023. We also 
launched a “50 Days of Caring” initiative leading up to the anniversary during which FedEx team members gave back to their communities through service 
projects around the world and created the FedEx Founder’s Fund — a philanthropic endowment honoring Frederick W. Smith and his legacy as a business 
leader and changemaker in communities around the world. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with its FedEx Cares Employee 
Giving program. 
 
We believe the investments we make in our communities today, combined with team member engagement, set the stage for a brighter tomorrow. For additional 
information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit fedexcares.com.
 
The Environment 
 
Our “Practical Sustainability” philosophy and “Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize” approach guide our sustainability strategy. At FedEx, we recognize our 
business’s effect on the environment and communities we serve, including greenhouse gas (“GHG”) criteria air pollutant emissions, noise pollution, and waste 
generation from packaging, and remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize these impacts. We are also cognizant of the effect climate change could have 
on our business operations. In our business planning and strategy, we consider events such as intensified weather, GHG emissions regulations, increased media 
and investor attention, and enhanced customer demands to address environmental challenges. FedEx has 50 years of experience proactively addressing 
unexpected situations, such as severe weather events, and we maintain system flexibility to minimize impacts on our customers. While climate change poses a 
strategic risk to our business and stakeholders, we recognize the opportunities it simultaneously creates around sustainable products and services that advance 
our customers’ environmental goals. 
 
We align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, 
and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Our approach is informed by the climate-related physical and transition risks we identify through 
our enterprise risk management process. Climate change-related risks and opportunities are assessed as part of our annual risk assessment process, and we 
continue to closely monitor public attitudes, geopolitical concerns, and global regulations.
 
In 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by calendar 2040 across our global operations’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our Scope 
3 contracted transportation emissions. To help reach this goal, we designated $2.0 billion of initial investment towards vehicle electrification, sustainable 
energy, and carbon sequestration, including a pledge of $100 million to Yale University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. In 
addition, we continue to leverage other approaches to reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, such as increased interline usage at FedEx Express and intermodal 
rail usage at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.

Vehicle Electrification
 
Electrifying a substantial portion of our global fleet of motorized vehicles is a crucial component of our path to carbon-neutral operations. We plan to transition 
the entire FedEx parcel pickup-and-delivery fleet to zero-tailpipe emissions electric vehicles by calendar 2040, using a phased approach to replace existing 
vehicles. For example, by calendar 2025, we expect 50% of FedEx Express global pickup-and-delivery vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all 
purchases by calendar 2030, subject to availability. 
 
FedEx Express continues to expand its electric vehicle fleet through its relationship with General Motors’ BrightDrop, and has taken delivery of 500 BrightDrop 
electric vehicles as of June 2023. FedEx Ground is developing a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the electric vehicle transition for our independent service 
providers, and is implementing the necessary infrastructure at our facilities to provide charging solutions. Additionally, FedEx Freight is evaluating electric 
vehicle opportunities to define scalable solutions for its entire fleet.
 
We are actively building the innovative charging infrastructure required to support our growing fleet of electric vehicles across our vast network of facilities, 
and continue to electrify forklifts, airport ground service equipment, and other non-road vehicles across our operating companies to reduce fuel and 
maintenance costs. We understand that challenges remain, including electric vehicle availability, electrification of certain vehicle classes due to operational 
needs, legislative changes, grid capacity, and certain operating conditions. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
 
Fleet efficiency enables ongoing fuel, emissions, and cost reductions as the industry works to address these challenges. FedEx Express has established a goal to 
increase vehicle fleet efficiency by 50% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025. Through 2022, our efforts collectively resulted in a 40% improvement in 
FedEx Express vehicle fleet efficiency from our 2005 baseline. 
 
Sustainable Fuels
 
To reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, we continue to pursue viable, cost-effective alternative fuels. Our global fleet of over 6,200 alternative fuel vehicles 
includes hybrid, electric, liquified or compressed natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and we will continue to grow our 
alternative fuel fleet in the coming years, subject to availability. Decarbonizing heavyweight transportation is more challenging than parcel pickup-and-delivery 
vehicles due to the required mileage range and the time needed to refuel or charge. We continue to explore alternative fuels for certain vehicles not easily 
electrifiable. 
 
We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our annual jet fuel usage from blends of alternative fuels by calendar 2030. The U.S. government has 
passed legislation in recent years to incentivize production, and the EU recently adopted legislation implementing sustainable aviation fuel mandates. We 
understand the challenges the industry faces in deploying sustainable aviation fuel at scale and recognize other solutions may be needed to help the aviation 
industry improve efficiency and reduce emissions. To help accelerate solutions, we are members of the First Movers Coalition, participating in the Aviation 
Sector working group, a global initiative working to decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial sectors, including the aviation industry.
 
Aircraft Fuel Conservation and Fleet Modernization
 
We continuously work to reduce the environmental impact of our aircraft fleet. Since 2005, we reduced our overall aircraft emissions intensity by 28%, 
primarily due to our ongoing FedEx Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives. Our global FedEx Fuel Sense program, which accounted for 13 million 
gallons of jet fuel savings in 2022, enables us to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated GHG emissions. 
 
Additionally, our commitment to modernizing our aircraft fleet lowers costs, enhances reliability and operational adaptability, improves fuel efficiency, and 
reduces emissions intensity. During 2023, we retired our MD-10-30 fleet and accelerated the retirement of our MD-11 fleet to the end of 2028. See the “Results 
of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information on aircraft retirements during 2023. 
 
We took delivery of two Boeing 777 Freighter (“B777F”) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional six B777F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Similarly, 
we took delivery of 14 Boeing 767-300 Freighter (“B767F”) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional 24 B767F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Delays 
could impact these timelines. We also continue to deploy new ATR 72-600F aircraft for shorter feeder routes to replace our aging ATR-42 aircraft and Cessna 
SkyCourier 408 cargo aircraft to help reduce the number of planes needed per feeder route and further improve our fuel efficiency. For more information about 
our expected future aircraft deliveries, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment” and Note 17 of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Facilities
 
We aim to continuously improve the sustainability, reduce the environmental impact, and increase the efficiency of our more than 5,000 air and ground hubs, 
local stations, freight service centers, and retail locations. While our energy demand is increasing to support electric vehicle deployment and charging 
infrastructure, we have increased our focus on facility energy management and off-site renewable energy procurement strategies to overcome this challenge. 
Energy management systems are essential to increasing efficiency at our facilities through monitoring, regulating, and optimizing our lighting, heating, 
ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment. In 2022, we generated on- and off-site solar energy at 29 locations across our operating companies. 
 
We adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) standard in the U.S. and the Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method (“BREEAM”) in Europe to guide efficient facility design when appropriate. FedEx Express and FedEx Freight seek LEED certification on 
all new construction, and in total FedEx has 44 LEED-certified facilities and 13 BREEAM-certified facilities across our operating companies. 
 
To reduce our operational waste footprint, we implement waste and recycling management processes in the U.S. We prioritize reducing our waste generation 
and recycling the waste we do produce.
 
Sustainable Customer Solutions
 
FedEx works to minimize packaging materials, optimize customer package size and weight, increase shipping efficiency, and maximize recyclability to reduce 
the environmental impacts of packaging materials and transporting goods. We offer end-to-end sustainability for customers by supplying sustainable packaging 
solutions and exploring carbon-neutral shipping opportunities. FedEx-branded cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable and contains an average of 36% 
recycled content. During 2022, 64% of FedEx-branded packaging was third-party certified and all paper purchased by FedEx Office was from vendors with 
responsible forest-management practices.
 
In 2023, we introduced the FedEx Sustainability Insights tool in the U.S., which built upon our previous Customer Emissions Calculator, to increase 
accessibility for our customers and suppliers to estimate CO2e shipping emissions at package and account levels. Created by FedEx Dataworks, this cloud-based 
engine uses near-real time FedEx network data to estimate CO2e emissions for both individual tracking numbers and fedex.com accounts. Users can view 
historical emissions data by account as well as search by tracking number with their fedex.com login. 
 
For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see fedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html.
 
Governance 
 
The FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate governance and 
accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate 
Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our 
longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, 
officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the ESG heading under “Governance” on the 
Investor Relations page of our website at investors.fedex.com. We will post under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our website information 
regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure is required. 
 
Business Segments 
 
The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments: 
 
FedEx Express Segment 
 
FedEx Express 
 
Overview 
 
FedEx Express invented express distribution 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages 
and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated global network. 
 
- 9 -
 
FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that generate 
more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, historically with a money-back guarantee. As of July 13, 
2023, the money-back guarantee remains suspended for certain FedEx Express services in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Express’s 
unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world’s largest 
express transportation company. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 245,000 employees and had approximately 70,000 drop-off 
locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), 700 aircraft, and 
more than 82,000 vehicles in its global network.
 
FedEx Express also provides time-critical shipment services through FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (“FedEx Custom Critical”) and cross-border enablement and 
technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions.
 
Services 
 
FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. FedEx Express offers three U.S. 
domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is 
available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight 
services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market. 
 
International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet 
distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides 
time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more 
than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in 
one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including

For information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “FedEx 
Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.” 
International Expansion 
Over the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation networks. Our 2016 
acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express’s lower-cost road 
networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network 
integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency, 
and the reopening and completion of central European road hubs in Duiven, The Netherlands and Novara, Italy in 2023 have improved our intra-European 
service. 
 
We also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun 
International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation 
point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport. 
During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to 
continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets. In 2022, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with 
Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. 
 
To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable 
customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.

U.S. Postal Service Agreement 
 
Pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) that expires on September 29, 2024, FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation 
of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS’s 
international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see 
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
 
Pricing 
 
FedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the 
service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective 
January 2, 2023, FedEx Express implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services. 
 
In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and November 2020 FedEx Express 
implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges continued as peak surcharges beginning in 
November 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Express has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to 
U.S. domestic shipments that are oversized or require additional handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. 
Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak 
season. Effective January 16, 2023, the U.S. domestic holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges for 
shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward. 
 
FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and 
contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to 
the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine U.S. domestic fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. Effective 
January 30, 2023, the tables used to determine certain international fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook 
— Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual 
Report for more information. 
 
Operations 
 
FedEx Express’s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company’s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub 
facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to expand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize 
our Memphis World Hub. See the “Financial Condition — Liquidity Outlook” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in 
Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
 
Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, 
Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. 
The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami — the 
Miami Gateway Hub — serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large 
European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, FedEx Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, 
and South America. FedEx Express’s unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more than 700 
stations. 
 
Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick 
up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (“Global Service Participants”) have been selected to 
complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report 
under the caption “FedEx Express Segment.” 
 
In connection with our DRIVE initiatives and through collaborations with FedEx Dataworks, we are transforming and optimizing the FedEx Express network to 
be more agile and efficient, including through the deployment of digital assets that allow us to more effectively balance the use of FedEx aircraft and Global 
Service Participants and implementation of a single daily dispatch of couriers within the U.S. domestic network.
 
- 11 -
 
FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to 
provide in-store drop-off sites, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide 
customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and corporate or industrial parks.
 
Fuel Supplies and Costs 
 
During 2023, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be 
delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See “Pricing” above. 
 
The following table sets forth FedEx Express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:  
 
Fiscal Year  Total Jet
Fuel Cost
(in millions)   Percentage of 
Consolidated
Revenue  
2023  $ 4,515   5.0%
2022   3,867   4.1 
2021   2,065   2.5 
2020   2,265   3.3 
2019   2,847   4.1 
 
Most of FedEx Express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. 
 
Competition 
 
As described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and 
service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and 
speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer’s overall 
supply chain. 
 
Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), passenger airlines offering express 
package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. FedEx Express’s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD 
(a subsidiary of France’s La Poste’s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger 
airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with 
crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-
house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established 
a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of FedEx 
Express’s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit 
sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
Employees 
 
John A. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer — U.S. and Canada Ground Operations of FedEx Express and Richard W. Smith is the President 
and Chief Executive Officer — Airline and International of FedEx Express. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 188,000 permanent 
full-time and approximately 56,000 permanent part-time employees. 
 
The pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by ALPA and are employed under a collective bargaining 
agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor 
agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the NMB began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative 
successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being 
presented to FedEx Express’s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations.
 
- 12 -
 
In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express’s non-U.S. employees are unionized. In June 2022, the Transport Workers Union filed an 
application with the NMB requesting an election to represent approximately 130 Global Operations Control (“GOC”) specialists who perform flight dispatching 
functions in FedEx Express’s GOC center. The NMB dismissed the application in December 2022. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for more information.

FedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Among its services are 
Surface Expedite, providing exclusive-use shipping and time-definite services; Air Expedite, offering an array of expedited air solutions to meet customers’ 
critical delivery times; and White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control, or specialized security. Service from 
FedEx Custom Critical is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. FedEx Custom Critical continuously monitors shipments through an integrated proprietary 
shipment-control system, including two-way satellite communications on exclusive-use shipments. 
 
FedEx Ground Segment 
 
Overview
 
By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx 
Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential ground package delivery services. As of July 13, 2023, 
the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves 
customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service 
is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is 
also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network 
operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential delivery to more than half of the U.S. 
population. See “One FedEx and Network 2.0” above for information regarding the transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to 
FedEx Express beginning in April 2024.
 
The company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs 
of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. 
Sunday delivery is provided for more than half of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their 
customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for 
the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the 
U.S. 
 
Pricing
 
FedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on 
the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective 
January 2, 2023, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 6.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also 
increased.
 
To manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of 
surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a 
certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, 
and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for 
residential shipments, and peak surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward. 
 
FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to 
the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground were updated. See the “Results of 
Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial 
Condition” of this Annual Report for more information.

Operations
 
FedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 700 sortation and distribution facilities, including more than 160 fully automated stations, in the U.S. 
and Canada as of May 31, 2023. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service 
providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul 
network.
 
Following a network expansion in recent years that substantially increased FedEx Ground’s daily capacity through the addition of new facilities featuring the 
latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities, in 2023 the company rationalized its operations 
in response to lower volumes by consolidating sorts and cancelling several planned network capacity projects, continuing to manage staffing levels effectively, 
and reducing Sunday delivery operations. 
 
FedEx Ground continues to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities and deploy new technologies to enhance operational efficiency. 
Advanced automated unloading and sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. FedEx Ground yard management 
systems, which interact with GPS tags on each trailer and create geofences around FedEx Ground facilities, automatically notify the control center when a 
trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their 
appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery. 
 
Through collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Ground is implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount with volumes and is 
introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. Dock 
modernization efforts enabled by FedEx Dataworks, including a new network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more 
detailed and accurate volume forecasts, are enhancing productivity at FedEx Ground in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Additionally, the company is 
testing autonomous, driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled robotic product 
sortation systems to sort small packages.
 
Advanced route optimization technology leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks provides service providers near real-time data that can be used to plan 
efficient delivery routes and make decisions about vehicle mix and workforce. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to 
offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery 
signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-commerce tools and solutions, including 
FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.” 
 
FedEx Ground has introduced new vehicle safety technologies and incentives for adoption by its service providers, as well as new eligibility standards for 
drivers employed by service providers. Additionally, FedEx Ground has made significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large 
and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments. 
 
FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at all FedEx 
Authorized ShipCenters and other FedEx OnSite locations, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores.  
 
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Ground employed approximately 56,000 permanent full-time and approximately 136,000 permanent part-time employees. In 
addition, FedEx Ground contracts with nearly 7,000 independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of these 
service providers is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. 
 
FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of drivers employed by 
service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these 
independent businesses. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx 
consolidation plan. For a description of these proceedings, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report and Note 18 of the consolidated financial 
statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.

Scott L. Ray is the President of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and its primary competitors are UPS, the 
USPS, and regional delivery carriers. FedEx Ground also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local 
market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and 
utilizing independent contractors for deliveries. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs and vehicles and has expressed an intention to 
offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
FedEx Freight Segment
 
Overview
 
FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — 
FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost 
savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door 
for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to 
virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times 
of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx 
Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands via alliances. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Freight services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service 
and safety.
 
Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry-leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx 
electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. These 
solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on 
FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company’s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail, or 
fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. 
Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship 
Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server, and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery 
offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier 
transportation management system that provides customers with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to 
book service and make payments. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its 
docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level.
 
FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with 
basic and basic by appointment to-the-door services available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population and standard and premium through-the-door services 
available to 90% of the continental U.S. population, as well as flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with 
flexible pickup windows and label-less options.
 
As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 vehicles from a network of approximately 390 service centers and had 
approximately 43,000 employees. The company plans to close and consolidate approximately 30 locations in the first quarter of 2024, and conducted several 
rounds of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels in 2023. Lance D. Moll is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based 
in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO 
Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc.
 
We are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at one FedEx Freight facility. 
 
Pricing
 
FedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the 
service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 
2, 2023, FedEx Freight implemented a 6.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 7.9% average list 
price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and 
Canada. 
 
- 15 -
 
In order to manage demand and capacity constraints, beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a peak surcharge applying to specific delivery points 
within the U.S. The peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable 
length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the 
carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the extreme length surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore 
ways to modernize freight pricing including through dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to 
cost and price shipments.
 
FedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the 
day in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight were updated. See the “Results of Operations 
and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of 
this Annual Report for more information. 
 
FedEx Services Segment
 
FedEx Services provides our other companies with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and 
collection services, and certain other back-office support. Through FedEx Services, we provide a convenient single point of access for many customer support 
functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our 
customers. 
 
Brie A. Carere and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. 
As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees. 
 
Customer-Driven Technology 
 
FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information about a package is as important as the delivery of 
the package itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers’ business 
problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for 
the success of e-commerce deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and 
businesses deliver. During 2023 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe computing to cloud-based 
systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and resiliency. See “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment” 
below for more information on the solutions we are creating to “Innovate for Tomorrow.”
 
Shipping Management and Precision Tracking
 
The fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking 
provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model 
developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on fedex.com, delivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for 
early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual Assistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping 
questions, allowing our customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions. 
 
SenseAware, a FedEx innovation currently available in 135 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical shipments by providing 
real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure readings, light exposure, and shock events. 
Additionally, FedEx SenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location 
visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a 
package’s location within the FedEx Express network. FedEx is currently expanding access to FedEx SenseAware ID and plans to eventually make FedEx 
SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium FedEx Express services.
 
FedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The FedEx Mobile app provides 
convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home deliveries. Shippers can easily get rates and estimated 
delivery times and swiftly create a shipping label. All users can quickly find the nearest FedEx location for Hold at Location or drop-off. It is available on 
Android™ and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. SMS Notifications allows 
customers to track or follow a package via text messaging, and it is currently available in five countries. 
- 16 -
 
 
Additionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions, which was modernized in 2023, offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their 
parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes. 
 
E-Commerce Solutions
 
FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule 
dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for returns management, provides high-volume 
merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed 
decisions based on shoppers’ returns behaviors. In 2023 we launched FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, easy e-commerce solution for low-
weight returns facilitated through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who 
purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. 
The returned items will then be consolidated with other returns and processed through FedEx Logistics and sent back to the merchants via a less-than-truckload 
option.
 
FedEx OnSite, our retail convenience network, utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The FedEx OnSite network has 
grown to include nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores in addition to our approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. In addition to 
allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the FedEx OnSite network is well positioned to serve as a “buy online, pickup in store” 
network for small and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology to the Walgreens retail network, 
which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package.
 
We have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders 
into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx 
Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as 
midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment process.
 
In June 2022, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and Canada that are released 
without a signature. The capability has expanded to 90% of global residential deliveries.
 
Through innovative partnerships, FedEx Dataworks seeks to open pathways to e-commerce and empower customers with differentiated insights and tools. In 
2021, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce’s Magento platform. By 
integrating their online storefronts with ShopRunner, Adobe merchants are able to offer seamless checkout, two-day shipping, easy returns, and exclusive offers 
to shippers. The collaboration also gives merchants access to FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence, allowing for better management of supply chains. In 
2022, we announced a multi-year partnership with Salesforce that integrates Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Order Management with innovative 
capabilities from FedEx and ShopRunner. In January 2022, FedEx and Microsoft announced a new cross-platform logistics solution for e-commerce aimed at 
increasing merchant competitiveness in the e-commerce space by improving customer engagement and providing enhanced shipping options, which was made 
available to customers in the U.S. in 2023. Additionally, in June 2022 FedEx and FourKites announced a strategic alliance to provide businesses with new, more 
robust real-time supply chain visibility capabilities. In November 2022, we announced a strategic alliance with Cart.com to create integrated solutions that help 
address some of the biggest e-commerce challenges.
 
Autonomous Solutions
 
FedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we announced a multi-year, multi-phase agreement to test Nuro’s 
next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will explore various use cases for on-road autonomous 
vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries. 
 
In 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (“Aurora”) and PACCAR Inc. to test Aurora’s autonomous driving technology in PACCAR 
autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations. Additionally, FedEx Express is developing plans to test Elroy Air’s 
autonomous air cargo system within the company’s middle-mile logistics operations, moving shipments between sortation locations. We are also working with 
major national retailers, fast food restaurants, and drug stores to help assess different customers’ autonomous delivery needs. In 2023, FedEx ended the research 
and development program for Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, to prioritize these other nearer-term opportunities.

Marketing
The FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, 
one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print, and digital 
advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors:
 
•     The UEFA Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.
 
•     The season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA Tour, and the FedEx St. Jude Championship, a PGA Tour event that has raised millions of 
dollars for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is one of three annual FedExCup playoff events.
 
•     The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Cup Series.
 
Additionally, FedEx is the “Official Delivery Service Sponsor” and “Official Office Services Provider” of the NFL, through which we conduct events and other 
activities to promote the FedEx brand, such as the “FedEx Air & Ground” NFL Players of the Week and Players of the Year Awards.
Information Security
 
FedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers’ shipments and protecting our customers’, 
vendors’, and employees’ privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with 
applicable information security laws, regulations, and industry standards. For a description of risks related to information security, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” 
of this Annual Report.
 
FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment
 
The FedEx Dataworks operating segment is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our 
customers’ supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers. The size and scale of our global network gives us a bird’s-eye view of global 
supply chains and trends and provides an immense amount of data. As the digital twin of our physical network and a key enabler of our DRIVE transformation, 
FedEx Dataworks leverages this information to allow us to work differently through a more technology-enabled, data-driven approach. See “FedEx Express 
Segment — FedEx Express — Operations” and “FedEx Ground Segment — Operations” above for information regarding how FedEx Dataworks is enabling 
the transformation and optimization of our physical network at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. FedEx Dataworks is also helping to build out a dynamic 
pricing infrastructure, which enabled 2023 holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on an individual customer’s weekly peaking factor, 
and exploring and implementing ways for predictive anomaly detection to improve revenue quality.
 
FedEx Surround allows business customers to enhance visibility into its supply chain by leveraging data to provide near-real-time analytics into shipment 
tracking, which will drive more precise logistics and inventory management. FedEx Dataworks is helping to facilitate an open and collaborative e-commerce 
ecosystem that helps merchants provide seamless end-to-end experiences for their customers. ShopRunner is an e-commerce platform that directly connects 
brands and merchants with online shoppers. ShopRunner’s data-driven marketing and omnichannel enablement capabilities also help brands and merchants 
acquire high-value customers and accelerate their digital innovation by using ShopRunner’s e-commerce platform. We believe the complementary nature of 
ShopRunner’s pre-purchase offerings combined with FedEx’s post-purchase logistics intelligence enables brands and merchants to attract and engage 
consumers at scale by providing innovative online shopping experiences. In November 2022, ShopRunner announced the launch of its new mobile application. 
For additional information regarding FedEx Dataworks e-commerce partnerships, tools, and solutions, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven 
Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.”

centers, and on-site business centers at colleges and universities, hotels, convention centers, corporate campuses, and healthcare campuses. Many of these 
locations are open later in the evenings to accommodate urgent printing projects and delivery drop-offs. FedEx Office has designed a suite of printing and 
shipping management solutions that are flexible and scalable, allowing customers to meet their unique printing and shipping needs. The network provides an 
adaptable cost model helping to save time, labor, and overhead by freeing up resources and avoiding fixed costs associated with large-scale printing and e-

using FedEx Office’s Print & Go solutions to print at self-serve locations from USBs, the cloud, or through email. Print & Go solutions allow customers to 
access files using popular cloud providers Google Drive™, Box, Microsoft OneDrive®, and from FedEx Office’s own My Online Documents, making printing 
easy. 
 
FedEx Office has prioritized e-commerce and digital offerings as a growth opportunity for the enterprise/large, medium, and small business customers we serve. 
FedEx Office has partnered with a content and creative design platform to form a digital design-to-print marketplace offering millions of images and

introduce an online branded promotional products marketplace that allows businesses to customize and purchase high-quality promotional products. FedEx 
Office has also made investments in new machines and technology, enhancing capabilities in narrow format color, grand format, large format, color 
management, enhanced finishing, and other technologies.
 
FedEx Office provides customers convenient access to the full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services. Customers may have their FedEx 
Express and FedEx Ground packages delivered to any FedEx Office customer-facing location nationwide through the Hold at FedEx Location service, free of 
charge, and may redirect packages to these locations through Redirect to Hold or AutoRedirect to Hold services. FedEx Office facilitates e-commerce and 
returns through FedEx Returns Technology, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, which we 
launched in 2023, shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at a FedEx 
Office location. For information regarding FedEx Consolidated Returns, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce 
Solutions.” We discontinued FedEx SameDay City operations during 2023.
 
FedEx Office also offers packing services, and packing supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings. By allowing customers to have items 
professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Office team members and then shipped using FedEx Ground day-definite shipping or time-definite global 
FedEx Express shipping services, FedEx Office offers a complete “pack-and-ship” solution.  FedEx Office also offers FedEx Pack Plus, which includes custom 
box building capabilities and techniques; a robust assortment of specialty boxes; and additional packing supplies, equipment, and tools to serve our customers’ 
needs.
 
Almost all FedEx Office locations provide local pickup-and-delivery service for print jobs completed by FedEx Office. A FedEx courier picks up a customer’s 
print job at the customer’s location and then returns the finished product to the customer. Options and services vary by location.

“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report.
Trademarks
 
The “FedEx” trademark, service mark, and trade name are essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx 
Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and 
ShopRunner, among others, are trademarks, service marks, and trade names of Federal Express Corporation or the respective companies for which registrations, 
or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service 
marks, and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, 
service marks, and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness. 
Regulation  
 
Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), both the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal 
Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express. 
 
- 20 -
 
The FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel 
and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds 
an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in 
effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. 
 
The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other 
regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx 
Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. These certificates will remain in effect as we maintain 
our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan.
 
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the 
Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator 
Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of 
regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that 
these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. 
 
FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military 
use certain of FedEx Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the 
operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. 
Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a 
consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights. 
 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, 
that could affect our business.
 
Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation 
Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most 
motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration. 
 
The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, 
and services in interstate freight transportation. 
 
Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate 
operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.
 
International. FedEx Express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the 
world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers 
abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the 
foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The 
regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient 
manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are 
subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments. 
 
Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including 
certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as 
FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.

Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is 
subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates and 
licenses FedEx Express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications, and also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process. The FCC recently 
expanded the use of the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz (“GHz”) spectrum band, which has historically been reserved for aviation, to support the implementation of “5G” 
cellular networks across the U.S. In December 2021, following concerns of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters by the expanded use of the 3.7 to 
4.2 GHz spectrum band, the FAA issued airworthiness directives prohibiting U.S. aircraft operators from operating at U.S. airports affected by 5G cellular 
networks without radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements unless authorized via an alternative means of compliance. FedEx Express’s U.S. air operations 
continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the FAA’s issuance of alternative means of compliance while the company modified its fleet to comply 
with the directives. In June 2022, the FAA announced its expectation that U.S. aircraft operators have radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements in place by 
July 2023. As of July 1, 2023, FedEx Express’s U.S. air operations are in compliance with the airworthiness directives, and we do not expect any subsequent 
operational disruptions from “5G” cellular network implementation.
 
Environmental. 
 
Noise: Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is authorized to establish 
standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to 
federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. 
These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material 
effect in any of FedEx Express’s significant markets. Congress’s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, 
which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express’s international operations are also subject 
to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates. 
 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and 
regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering 
GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions 
are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) formally adopted a 
global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”). This program 
established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global 
industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline 
was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO 
adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 emissions. To date, however, while the U.S. Congress is considering proposals to afford the DOT and FAA full 
authority to implement the market-based measures of CORSIA, the U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report 
our emissions data to the FAA.
 
Other ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA, and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, 
both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). For the EU, under these 
regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines 
including FedEx were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of 
free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the 
EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the 
scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance.
 
We expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of 
factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our 
ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be 
purchased by FedEx. 
 
- 22 -
 
Additionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to 
new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do 
not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its 
own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA is advancing its own 
conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would 
regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an 
agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG 
regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our 
business.
 
Hazardous Substances: In calendar 2022, the EPA proposed regulations to categorize certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) as “hazardous 
substances” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Numerous U.S. states, including California, 
have adopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting 
foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA’s proposed rule, once finalized, could subject airports, 
airlines, and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated 
facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations cannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to 
PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023.
 
We are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous 
goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage 
tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express 
has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize 
our operational environmental footprint, and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022. 
 
Export Controls. In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such 
regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving 
certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 
2018 (the “ECRA”) and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the “EARs”), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for 
shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in 
criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in 
improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases 
FedEx’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs. 
 
Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA 
within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and 
the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. 
 
Labor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the “RLA”), while labor relations within the U.S. at 
our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the “NLRA”). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must 
do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before 
a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down 
large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the 
negotiation process. 
 
The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, 
which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees 
have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they 
choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures 
that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network. 
 
- 23 -
 
The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For 
example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the 
FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. This jurisdiction 
could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the 
National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service 
providers contracting with FedEx Ground, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see “Item 1A. 
Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
Data Protection. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of 
personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally. For more information regarding data protection regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk 
Factors” of this Annual Report.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 
In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our 
business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to 
be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock.
Macroeconomic and Market Risks
 
We are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are 
particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to 
transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade — key macroeconomic 
measurements influenced by, among other things, inflation and deflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates and currency exchange rates, labor costs and 
unemployment levels, fuel and energy prices, public health crises, inventory levels, buying patterns and disposable income, debt levels, and credit availability. 
When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer 
markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances, which adversely affects our yields and profitability. Certain 
manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent 
macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments. Additionally, consumer spending has shifted from goods to services, and in 2023 we saw a 
customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services. We expect these trends to continue. Further, the scale of our operations and our relatively high 
fixed-cost structure, particularly at FedEx Express, make it difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels, which negatively affected our results of 
operations in 2023. For more information, see “Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.” 
below. 
 
Our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. We are experiencing a decline in demand for our 
transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher 
costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. During 
2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively affect customer demand for our services. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for additional information.
 
Moreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including 
international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets, and geopolitical risks such as the ongoing 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have suspended all services in Ukraine and Belarus. We 
also temporarily idled our operations in Russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active 
transport licenses. While we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material effect on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences of this 
conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic 
decisions to alter certain routes; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against us as a result of our idling of operations in Russia, including 
nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict’s 
effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.
 
To the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or subsequent similar conflicts between or among other nations, adversely affects our business, it 
may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and 
results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-
intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack; adverse changes in international trade policies; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including our fuel 
surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our FedEx Express 
international business; disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital 
resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; our ability to 
maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency 
fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Geopolitical uncertainty negatively affected operations at FedEx Express in recent 
years. 
- 25 -
 
 
Additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our 
business and results of operations. The U.S. government has taken certain actions that have negatively affected U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on 
certain goods imported into the U.S. Additionally, several foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the U.S. These actions 
contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years. Any further changes in U.S. or international 
trade policy, including tariffs, export controls, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions, could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in 
“trade wars” and further increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay 
tariffs or other anti-trade measures increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose such measures. Political uncertainty 
surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. Such conditions could 
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.
 
Additionally, the U.S. government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain 
circumstances, and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions. Furthermore, given the nature of our business and our global 
recognizability, foreign governments may target FedEx by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances, imposing monetary 
or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as 
on the price of our common stock.
 
Our transportation businesses are affected by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel. We must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our 
aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. In addition, our purchased transportation expense is 
affected by fuel costs. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense effect of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel 
surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because 
of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel costs could adversely affect our operating results. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. As of May 31, 2023, we had no derivative financial 
instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
 
Even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express 
services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of 
fuel could have a negative effect on our ability to operate our transportation networks. The following factors may affect fuel supply and could result in shortages 
and price increases in the future: weather-related events; natural disasters; political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries; economic sanctions 
imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants; changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production, transportation, taxes, or 
marketing; changes in refining capacity; environmental concerns; cyberattacks; and public and investor sentiment. Several of these factors combined to 
constrain fuel supply in 2023, and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2024.
Operating Risks
 
The failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and our one FedEx consolidation plan in the expected time 
frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, FedEx announced our DRIVE transformation 
program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and 
delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, 
FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation. See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. These entities currently operate as 
separate and independent businesses and networks. There can be no assurances that these businesses and networks can successfully be consolidated and fully 
integrated as planned. It is possible that the consolidation and integration process could result in higher than currently expected costs, less-than-expected 
savings, the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, union organizing, litigation, the loss of key FedEx employees or service providers, or other 
unexpected issues. It is also possible that the overall process will take longer than currently anticipated. Additionally, the following issues, among others, must 
be addressed in order to realize the anticipated timing and projected benefits of our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan: 
 
•     combining the physical networks and operations of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, including consolidating the companies’ linehaul and pickup-
and-delivery operations, and corporate functions; 
 
•     our ability to maintain coverage of U.S. employees at FedEx Express under the RLA and manage challenges to the employment status of drivers 
employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground, in addition to other labor-related risks;
- 26 -
 
 
•     integrating, consolidating, and implementing new administrative and back-office support functions, information-technology infrastructure, and 
computer systems of the respective companies; 
 
•     integrating and restructuring the corporate entities;
 
•     integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical FedEx Express and FedEx Ground customers;
 
•     harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and other policies, 
procedures, and processes;
 
•     maintaining existing agreements with customers and service providers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective 
customers and service providers; 
 
•     legal challenges by FedEx Ground service providers or government agencies seeking to slow or stop plans related to Network 2.0 or our one FedEx 
consolidation; 
 
•     addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies; 
 
•     addressing employee issues so as to promote retention and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations; 
 
•     maintaining access to ports of call and railroads for intermodal support;
 
•     managing the movement of certain positions to different locations; 
 
•     obtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents; and
 
•     managing unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the consolidation and integration process.
 
We may not be able to achieve the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and 
reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan. The actual amount and timing 
of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from 
our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and 
deferred tax balances. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, our future financial results 
will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals. 
 
All of these factors could adversely affect FedEx’s results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention 
of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan and diverted from day-to-day business 
operations, which may disrupt our business. 
 
A significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical confidential 
information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our 
businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, and compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication, security, and 
reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business 
information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services 
consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive package-level information in advance of physical receipt of 
packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, 
and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, including through 
cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and 
activists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and 
other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions 
from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information 
technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, “Acts of God,” transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our 
FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could 
result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including 
personal information. 
- 27 -
 
 
The technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were 
not able to identify prior to the acquisition. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2021, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and 
their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and 
subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including 
payment information and/or other confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the 
event of a data breach. 
 
We also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties, including our customers and third-party service providers such as cloud service 
providers and delivery services. Such third parties may host, process, or have access to information we maintain about our company, customers, employees, and 
vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services. Like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches, 
cyberattacks, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems. We have security processes, protocols, and 
standards in place, including contractual provisions requiring such security measures, that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect 
information that is held by them, or to which they have access, as a result of their engagements with us. Nevertheless, a cyberattack could defeat one or more of 
such third parties’ security measures, allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or disrupt our 
operations. These third parties may also experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential 
data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.
 
A disruption to our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those affecting our computer systems and websites, could result in the loss of 
confidential business or customer information, require substantial repairs or replacements, resulting in significant costs, and lead to the temporary or permanent 
transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors. The foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operations, customer 
service, and results of operations. Additionally, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created. 
These types of adverse effects could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was 
compromised due to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party. We or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach 
and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. 
 
We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management, business continuity, and disaster recovery 
plans, including investments to retire and replace end-of-life systems. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing 
monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. 
Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions, data loss, and cyber-fraud, which could adversely affect our 
competitiveness and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2021 for information 
regarding the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack at TNT Express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we have experienced 
continual attempts by cyber criminals, some of which have been successful, to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and 
misappropriating items being transported in our network. None of these fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any 
material costs to FedEx. 
 
While we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future. Additionally, 
while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain 
excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers will pay on our insurance claims, or we will not experience a claim for which 
coverage is not provided. See “Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection.” below for 
additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection. A significant number of our employees as well as 
customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely or in hybrid models, which may heighten these risks. These risks may also be 
heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.
- 28 -
 
 
We are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us. We are 
self-insured up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, 
property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on 
estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. Estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of 
claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. However, the 
use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is 
known, which may be several years. Material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance 
retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-
insurance costs and our reserve estimates. As a result, our insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our 
results of operations and financial condition. During 2023, higher self-insurance accruals negatively affected our results of operations. See “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information.
 
As a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we self-insure. 
Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Although we 
believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of 
blockbuster or so-called “nuclear” verdicts, including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents 
and their families. See Note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of our Quarterly Report 
on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2022 for information regarding the 2015 jury award of approximately $160 million in compensatory 
damages in a lawsuit related to a vehicle accident involving a driver employed by a service provider engaged by FedEx Ground, subsequent court affirmation of 
the award in 2018 and 2022, and our pursuit of reimbursement from insurers of our payment of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. 
Given this recent trend, it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If another claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance 
coverage, we would bear the excess in addition to our other self-insured amounts.
 
Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are 
increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses 
may continue to increase, or we could further increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. Our results of operations and financial 
condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess 
insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is 
not provided.
 
The effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis on our business, results of operations, and 
financial condition are highly unpredictable. A widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis, including new 
variants of COVID-19, could have varying effects on the demand for our services, our business operations, and the global economy and supply chains. The 
extent of the effect of such an event on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the global economy, will be dictated by 
developments that cannot be predicted, such as its duration and spread; the success of efforts to contain it and treat its effects, such as travel bans and 
restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions; the possibility of additional subsequent widespread 
outbreaks and variant strains and the effect of actions taken in response; and the resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we 
operate. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19 environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near 
pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023.
 
Our business is labor and capital intensive in nature, which may require us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during such an event. If we are unable 
to remain agile and flex our networks to align with shipping volumes, customer needs, disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies, market 
demands, and operating conditions, or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies, our business operations could be negatively 
affected, which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our 
operations, the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers may be higher than similar expenses incurred by 
companies in other industries.

To the extent a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis adversely affects our business and financial results, 
it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade 
policies and relations; our ability to execute our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, implement our business strategy, and effectively 
respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; our ability to meet our labor and 
purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; changes in the business and financial soundness of the USPS; our ability to achieve our goal of 
carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the effect of litigation or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, or other 
third parties relating to the crisis or our actions in response.
 
See “Description of Business Segments  — Trends Affecting Our Business” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations 
and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition” of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended May 31, 2020, May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2022, for information 
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 
The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities. Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, 
governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow 
service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of 
regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires 
FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. 
Additionally, the ICAO’s standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, 
which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are 
now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security 
requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The effects on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including 
airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack 
directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely affect demand for our services. 
Strategic Risks
 
Failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our 
future financial results to suffer. We are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as those 
related to our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan. See “The failure to successfully execute our DRIVE 
transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future 
results.” above and “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual 
Report for additional information. Such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We 
have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to 
derive the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost 
structure, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions. 
 
Further, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and the mix of 
services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth and inventory restocking, passenger airline cargo capacity, competition, and 
the global economy, and actual market, economic, and other conditions may be different from our assumptions. As technology, customer behavior, and market 
conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to 
successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will 
suffer. For additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Strategy.”

Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels. We make significant investments in aircraft, 
package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. The 
amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or 
modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on 
those projections. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to below-
market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect service levels. Difficulties in 
quickly adjusting our operations and fixed-cost structure to match shifting volume levels, particularly at FedEx Express, negatively affected our results of 
operations in 2023. Additionally, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition — Results of 
Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash 
impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from service.
 
We depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand. The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. FedEx 
is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In 
addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and 
corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales, marketing, and recruitment tools, and we devote 
significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with 
whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us or our 
service providers; low safety or service levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws and allegations or claims that 
result in litigation; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; labor relations and workforce 
reductions; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; our political activities and expenditures; our executive compensation 
practices; or use of artificial intelligence could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such 
as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly 
difficult for us to effectively respond. Certain forms of technology also allow users to alter images, videos, and other information relating to FedEx and present 
the information in a false or misleading manner. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social, political, public policy, or 
other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers, team 
members, governments, and regulatory bodies. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create 
difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as 
require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. 
 
Changes in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of 
FedEx Express, are likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, 
which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS’s First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for 
the USPS’s international delivery service. See “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under “FedEx Express Segment” for more information.
 
Pursuant to previously announced plans to restructure its operations, the USPS continues to implement strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance 
on the air network of FedEx Express, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. FedEx Express expects lower volumes from the USPS in 
2024. Additional changes in the USPS’s business, including further structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service 
commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative effects on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, the USPS’s contract with 
FedEx Express for domestic services expires on September 29, 2024, and there is no assurance that the contract will be renewed on terms that are commercially 
acceptable to FedEx. Additionally, a decision by the USPS to terminate the contract early could negatively affect our profitability.

We face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in 
periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to 
operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital 
more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup 
companies that combine technology with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package 
shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our 
revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its 
internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report for additional information.
 
We believe we compete effectively with these companies – for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, the existence of 
an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel 
costs), but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share. While we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, 
if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or 
offer services at lower prices, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further 
increase competition. Moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide, it may reduce our 
revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These effects could be exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer 
such capabilities to third parties. News regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively affect the price of our common stock. 
 
Additionally, advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; autonomous delivery; third-
party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may 
necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these 
investments.
 
Our inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint 
ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us. Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity, and profitability 
depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the expected benefits 
from these transactions. We regularly acquire businesses, enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories 
in which we provide services.
 
Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology, human 
resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies. Additionally, we may be required to make 
significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially 
expected. For example, existing and future customer data in the systems and business of FedEx and ShopRunner may not be ultimately interoperable, or may 
not be interoperable without significant added expense. 
 
While we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and long-
term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to 
support the value we allocate to acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets. We have previously incurred goodwill impairment 
charges related to certain of our acquisitions, some of which have been material, and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. See “Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition — Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — 
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 
2023 related to the ShopRunner acquisition.

Human Resource Management Risks
 
Our failure to attract and retain employee talent, meet our purchased transportation needs, or maintain our company culture, as well as increases in labor 
and purchased transportation costs, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our 
high-quality employees, many of whom are longstanding FedEx team members. Difficulties in motivating, rewarding, recruiting, and retaining employee talent, 
including successors to members of senior management; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; 
and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and the price of our 
common stock. We also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, and FedEx Ground utilizes contracted service providers to 
conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.
 
Certain positions at FedEx have historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased recruiting, training, and retention costs. Additionally, 
our company culture is important to providing high-quality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing 
operations and other factors. If we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed. 
 
Our business is labor intensive in nature, and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject 
to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified service providers and persons in the markets where we and our contracted service providers 
operate and unemployment levels within these markets, prevailing and competitive wage rates and other benefits, health and other insurance costs, inflation, 
fuel and energy prices and availability, behavioral changes, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased 
minimum wage requirements) or government programs, safety levels of our operations, our reputation within the labor and transportation markets, changes in 
the business or financial soundness of service providers, interest in contracting with FedEx, the effect of a widespread public health crisis, the availability of 
child care, and vaccine mandates that may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses and service providers operate. Additionally, certain service 
providers (acting collectively or in coordination in some instances) may seek to increase financial rates or modify contract terms and may refuse to provide 
service to FedEx in connection with such initiatives.
 
Our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can increase our costs, hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, 
negatively affect service levels, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Certain of these risks may be heightened by our DRIVE 
transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.
 
Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do 
so. If we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our employees and to avoid having labor organizations organize groups of our employees, our 
operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, 
other than the pilots at FedEx Express and drivers at one FedEx Freight facility, our U.S. employees have thus far chosen not to unionize (we acquired FedEx 
Supply Chain in 2015, which already had a small number of employees who are members of unions). Additionally, certain of FedEx Express’s non-U.S. 
employees are unionized. For information regarding the tentative successor agreement FedEx Express reached with the union representing the pilots of FedEx 
Express in May 2023, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment — FedEx Express — Employees.”  
 
Labor unions have recently attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized, and in certain instances 
have been successful. Such attempts could continue in 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that 
would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express 
employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA. Additionally, this jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. For 
additional discussion of the RLA, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” Such legislation or challenge could expose our 
customers to the type of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent — local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of 
shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced 
shipping options and ready access to global markets. 
 
- 33 -
 
There is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx Ground and FedEx 
Freight, whose employees are governed by the NLRA. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the NLRB, have and may 
continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, as well as our vendor and supplier workforces, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. 
Finally, changes to federal or state laws, regulations, rules, judicial or administrative precedent, or guidance governing employee classification could affect the 
status of FedEx Ground’s service providers as independent employers of drivers. If FedEx Ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers 
of these service providers, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially, and we could incur 
significant capital outlays and experience adverse effects to service levels. 
 
FedEx Ground contracts with service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as 
direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged. We are defending joint-employer cases where it is alleged that FedEx 
Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We incur certain costs, 
including legal fees, in defending the status of service providers engaged by FedEx Ground as direct employers of their drivers. We continue to believe that 
FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. However, adverse determinations in these matters or 
regulatory developments could, among other things, entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service providers and 
FedEx Ground, and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground. The status of the drivers employed by these service 
providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. 
 
Proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us. In 2010, the FAA proposed regulations that 
would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to all-cargo air carriers. When the FAA issued final regulations in 2011 (the “2011 regulations”), all-
cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new requirements. Instead, all-cargo carriers were required to continue complying with 
previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique 
to each operation. In 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all-cargo carriers from the 2011 regulations, and litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia affirmed the FAA’s decision. However, this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups, and the U.S. Congress periodically 
considers legislation that, if adopted, would require all-cargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations. Required compliance with the 2011 regulations 
would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability.
 
Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements, and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare 
benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of 
our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans. The costs of providing 
pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, expected long-term investment returns on plan 
assets, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions 
and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a 
decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with 
significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the rules for pension and 
retirement benefit plan accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions, and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition, and 
liquidity. For example, our fourth quarter mark-to-market (“MTM”) retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million 
in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share). For additional 
information on our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial 
Condition—Results of Operations and Outlook—Consolidated Results—Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments” and Note 13 of the consolidated financial 
statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.

Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks
We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change. Concern over climate change, including the effect 
of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle 
engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the 
associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. 
Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx 
Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital and impairment costs associated with updating or 
replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope, and extent of such possible regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on 
our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct 
or indirect effect on our business, if instituted. For additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change, including CORSIA and the Paris climate 
accord, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” We may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and 
international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions.
Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the 
airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services. Finally, given 
the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of 
climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems. 
 
We may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.
In 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. Achievement of this goal depends on our execution of 
operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuels; aircraft fuel conservation and fleet modernization; facilities; and sustainable customer 
solutions. 
 
Execution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of 
which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, 
effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the 
availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-
site renewable energy, and other materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale; unforeseen production, design, 
operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and 
technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, 
global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related 
regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our 
transportation networks; the availability of incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical 
charging infrastructure, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain 
solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures.
 
There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal of carbon 
neutrality for our global operations. Additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable 
investments and/or initiatives (including our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan) over the achievement 
of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. Failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our 
calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, given investors’ and banks’ increased focus related 
to ESG matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of FedEx common stock and limit our access to financing. Such 
conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.
- 35 -
 
Our inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could 
adversely affect our business and results of operations. While we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world, there are 
concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as 
earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or 
threatened. Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather 
conditions. Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Express Memphis World Hub or one of our information-technology 
centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, 
resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on 
our business and results of operations.
Other Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks
Government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety 
of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, 
policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our 
business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan), harming our financial 
results. In particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy 
and sovereignty, the use of new technology, taxes, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the 
movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex economic 
sanctions, import and export controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and 
employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, regulated 
commodities, environmental or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital 
requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. For additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” 
Additionally, the current U.S. presidential administration and various U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies have indicated a desire to reform various aspects 
of existing laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could, among other things, lead to comprehensive tax reform, broadly increase the 
U.S. minimum wage, make it easier for unions to organize our U.S. employees or the employees of our service providers, and alter the employment relationship 
between service providers engaged by FedEx Ground and the drivers employed by those service providers.   
 
We could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and 
numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities 
and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, 
global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2022), digital taxes, 
and transactions between affiliated companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, 
and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.
 
Standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is 
different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Results of 
Operations and Outlook—Consolidated Results—Income Taxes” of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and 
challenges. Additionally, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Estimates
—Income Taxes” of this Annual Report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.

Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. There has recently been heightened 
regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal 
level) and internationally, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection 
Act, and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more 
stringent data localization requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data 
protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could harm our 
reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on 
discretionary factors, and difficult to predict. Consequently, compliance with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may 
present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks; require us to make 
extensive system or operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer. All of these evolving compliance and operational 
requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. 
Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data by FedEx Dataworks and the other 
FedEx operating companies.
The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may affect our operations and increase our operating costs. Our extensive air 
network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the DOT and generally requires a bilateral agreement between 
the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations 
outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal 
regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to 
compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or 
transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to 
operate our networks. Further, our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in 
international trade policies and relations.
We are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time 
issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures in order to comply. High-profile 
accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements. These requirements can be issued 
with little or no notice, or can otherwise affect our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary 
grounding of aircraft types altogether. Further, our business may be adversely affected when government agencies and air traffic control and other systems they 
oversee cease to operate as expected, including due to partial shutdowns, sequestrations, or similar events. Lapses in government operations may result in, 
among other things, disruptions in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals. For additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” 
of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.”  
We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: 
 
•   our ability to mitigate the technological, operational, legal and regulatory, and reputational risks related to autonomous technology and artificial 
intelligence;
 
•     the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state, and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;
 
•     changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian 
dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;
 
•     loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable;
 
•     any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative, and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, 
securities, vehicle accident, and discrimination and retaliation claims, claims related to our reporting and disclosure of climate change and other ESG 
topics, and any other legal or governmental proceedings, including the matters discussed in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report; 
 
- 37 -
 
•     adverse rulings on appeals and in other future judicial decisions, subsequent adverse jury findings, and changes in judicial precedent;
 
•     the sufficiency of insurance coverage we purchase;
 
•     the effect of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate 
unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;
 
•     disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and 
increase our costs;
 
•     difficulties experienced by the companies with which we contract to fly smaller regional “feeder” aircraft in attracting and retaining pilots, which 
could cause a reduction of service offered to certain locations, service disruptions, increased costs of operations, and other difficulties;
 
•     the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”), including the economic, operational, regulatory, and financial effects of any post-Brexit trade 
deal between the United Kingdom and EU;
 
•     governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our service levels due to traffic 
congestion, prolonged closure of key thoroughfares, or sub-optimal routing of our vehicles and aircraft;
 
•     stockholder activism, which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder execution of our business 
strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly; 
 
•     successful completion of our planned stock repurchases; and
 
•     constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, commercial paper ratings, and senior 
unsecured debt and pass-through certificate credit ratings, and our ability to meet credit agreement financial covenants.

FedEx Express leases these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the “Authority”). The lease obligates FedEx Express to maintain and 
insure the leased property and to pay all related taxes, assessments, and other charges. The lease is subordinate to, and FedEx Express’s rights thereunder could 
be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and the U.S. government. 
 
FedEx Express has additional major international sorting-and-handling facilities located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. FedEx

PART II 
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF 
EQUITY SECURITIES 
FedEx’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FDX.” As of July 13, 2023, there were 12,405 holders of record of our 
common stock. 
We expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, though each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of 
Directors. We evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any 
material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
On December 16, 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors, through which we are authorized to purchase, in the 
open market or in privately negotiated transactions, up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As of July 13, 2023, approximately $2.1 billion remains available 
to be used for repurchases under the December 2021 stock repurchase program, which is the only such program that currently exists. The program does not 
have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
We did not repurchase any shares of FedEx common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 
included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our stock repurchases during 
2023 and planned stock repurchases during 2024.
ITEM 6. [RESERVED] 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (“MD&A”) of FedEx Corporation (“FedEx” or the “Company”) 
is composed of three major sections: Results of Operations and Outlook, Financial Condition, and Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the 
following information: 
•Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2023 results compared to 2022 results. This section also includes a discussion of key 
actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2024. Discussion and analysis of 2021 results and year-over-year comparisons 
between 2022 results and 2021 results can be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial 
Condition” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) for the year ended May 31, 2022. 
- 45 -
 
•The overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2024, as well as a financial summary and analysis for 
each of our transportation segments. 
•Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial commitments, and liquidity 
outlook for 2024. 
•Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding the material judgments 
and assumptions incorporated in our financial results. 
The discussion in MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly “Item 1. Business,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” 
and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and 
innovating digitally as one FedEx. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express 
transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery 
services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”), a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation services. 
These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”), constitute our reportable segments. Our 
FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection 
services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. The operating costs of the FedEx Services segment are allocated to the business 
units it serves. See “Reportable Segments” for further discussion and refer to “Item 1. Business” for a more detailed description of each of our operating 
companies and information regarding our “one FedEx” consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx 
operating companies into Federal Express Corporation. 
The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include: 
•the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy; 
•the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size; 
•the mix of services purchased by our customers; 
•the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for LTL 
freight shipments); 
•our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and 
•the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. 
Trends Affecting Our Business
The following trends significantly impact the indicators discussed above, as well as our business and operating results. See the risk factors identified under Part 
I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. Additionally, see “Results of Operations and Outlook – Consolidated Results – Outlook” and “Results of 
Operations and Outlook – Financial Condition – Liquidity Outlook” below for additional information on efforts we are taking to mitigate adverse trends.
Macroeconomic Conditions
While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to 
trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the 
rate of growth of global trade. Our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. 
COVID-19 Pandemic and Supply Chain
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic had varying impacts on the demand for our services and our business operations and has contributed to global supply 
chain disruptions. During the first half of 2023, we continued to be affected by COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, which impacted both manufacturing and supply 
chains. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19 
- 46 -
 
environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023. As global supply chains 
stabilized during 2023, we experienced improvements in the availability of labor and vehicles, trailers, and other package handling equipment.
Inflation and Interest Rates
Global inflation is well above historical levels, impacting all areas of our business. Additionally, global interest rates continue to rise in an effort to curb 
inflation. We are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and 
business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other 
direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. We expect inflation and high interest rates to continue to negatively affect our results in 2024. 
Fuel
We must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly 
volatile. The timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges can significantly 
affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the short-term. Higher fuel prices drove an increase in yields through higher fuel surcharges and an 
increase in fuel expense during 2023 at all of our transportation segments.
Geopolitical Conflicts
Given the nature of our business and our global operations, geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of this Annual Report. The safety of our team members in Ukraine is our top 
priority. As we focus on the safety of our team members, we have suspended all services in Ukraine and Belarus. We also temporarily idled our operations in 
Russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. As a result, we incurred 
an immaterial amount of severance and other related expenses in 2023, which is included in business optimization expenses at FedEx Express. While we do not 
expect this conflict to have a direct material impact on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences are adversely affecting the global 
economy and fuel prices generally and may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” See “Results of 
Operations and Outlook – Consolidated Results – Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” below for additional information.
- 47 -
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK
Many of our operating expenses are directly affected by revenue and volume levels, and we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year 
basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends affecting 
expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and volumes. The line item “Other operating expense” includes costs associated with 
outside service contracts (such as temporary labor, security, and facility services and cargo handling), insurance, professional fees, operational supplies, and bad 
debt. 
Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 or ended May 31 of the year referenced, and comparisons are to 
the corresponding period of the prior year. References to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground 
segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.

Overview 
Our operating results for 2023 were negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation well above historical levels, and elevated global 
interest rates. In response to market conditions, we implemented cost reductions and focused on yield improvement to partially mitigate the effect of volume 
declines. Cost reductions included reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak 
wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations. The impact of cost actions lagged 
volume declines, particularly in the first half of 2023 and at FedEx Express, resulting in elevated operating expenses relative to demand. Additionally, our 
results in the first half of 2023 were negatively impacted by service challenges at FedEx Express.
Operating income in 2023 includes $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to 
permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express, and also includes $47 million ($44 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) of 
goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the ShopRunner, Inc. (“ShopRunner”) acquisition at FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”). 
See the “Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” section of this MD&A for more information.
Operating income in 2023 includes $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) of expenses associated with our DRIVE business 
optimization strategy announced in the first quarter of 2023, and also includes business realignment costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per 
diluted share) associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe announced in 2021. Operating income in 2022 includes $278 million ($214 million, net 
of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) of costs under this program. See the “Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for more 
information.
Operating income includes a $35 million charge ($26 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in 2023 related to a FedEx Ground legal matter and a $210 
million charge ($160 million, net of tax, or $0.60 per diluted share) in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate FedEx 
Ground legal matter. The amounts are included in “Corporate, other, and eliminations.” 
Operating expenses in 2022 include $132 million ($103 million, net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) of TNT Express integration expenses.
Net income includes a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 
($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share) associated with our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments. See the “Retirement Plans MTM 
Adjustments” section of this MD&A and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Net income in 2023 includes a $46 million ($0.18 per diluted share) tax expense from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. In 2022, we recognized a $142 
million ($0.53 per diluted share) tax benefit related to revisions of prior-year tax estimates for actual tax return results. See the “Income Taxes” section of this 
MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As part of the repurchase 
program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a bank in October 2022, which was completed in December 2022, to 
repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. Share repurchases had a benefit of $0.34 per diluted share in 2023. See Note 1 of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the “Financial Condition—Liquidity” section of this MD&A for additional information on our stock 
repurchase program.

Revenue 
Revenue decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines at all of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including 
higher fuel surcharges. 
FedEx Express revenue decreased 7% in 2023 due to lower global volume and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by yield improvement, including 
higher fuel surcharges. Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased due to lower yields and volumes at FedEx Trade Networks Transport & 
Brokerage, Inc. FedEx Ground revenue and FedEx Freight revenue each increased 1% in 2023, primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel 
surcharges, partially offset by lower volume. 
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 
aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft 
fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a 
noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were 
temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the 
goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 
2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of 
acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, 
or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information 
regarding these impairment charges, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements.
Business Optimization and Realignment Costs
In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company’s long-term profitability. This program includes a 
business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and support costs. We plan to consolidate our 
sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to 
an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other 
FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the 
respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal 
Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate 
our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel 
in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers.
We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs 
were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia. These business optimization costs are included in 
Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related expenditures is subject to our 
disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $500 million in 2024 and 
approximately $2.0 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.
In 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 
5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, 
net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business 
realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 
2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023. We expect 
savings from our business realignment activities to be approximately $275 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024.

Includes TNT Express integration expenses of $132 million in 2022.
Includes goodwill and other asset impairment charges in 2023 associated with the FedEx Express and FedEx Dataworks operating segments.
Includes costs associated with our DRIVE program in 2023 and the workforce reduction plan in Europe in 2023 and 2022. 
Includes a $35 million charge in 2023 related to a FedEx Ground legal matter and a $210 million charge in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest 
in connection with a separate FedEx Ground legal matter.
Operating income declined in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes at each of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including 
higher fuel surcharges. Cost reduction efforts such as reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and 
reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations partially 
mitigated the effects of volume declines on our results. 
Global inflation drove higher operating expenses related to salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2023. In addition, higher self-
insurance and bad debt accruals contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2023.
We recognized $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express. 
Our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the ShopRunner 
acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the “Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” and 
“Critical Accounting Estimates” sections of this MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Fuel 
We apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from 
ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. We routinely review our 
fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments. 
While fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of 
our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges 
we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered. 
Fuel expense increased 16% during 2023 due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a decline in fuel usage. In addition to variability in usage and market 
prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various 
indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the 
prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the 
preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily 
spot rates. These contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.

Because of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or 
change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the 
short-term. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Other Income and Expense 
Other retirement plans income (expense) increased primarily due to a noncash MTM gain of $650 million in 2023 compared to a $1.6 billion loss in 2022 
(described below). In addition, interest income increased $145 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in 
other income of $120 million related to changes in the value of equity investments. 
Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments 
In 2023, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM gain of $650 million ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share), related to the year-end actuarial 
adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to higher discount rates, partially offset 
by lower than expected asset returns and demographic experience.
In 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion 
($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and 
liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, 
partially offset by higher discount rates.
Additionally, in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter 
of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension Plan. Effective October 1, 2021, the responsibility of all 
pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multi-employer pension plan. The remaining $36 million net loss was related to the U.S. 
FedEx Freight Pension Plan and consisted of a $75 million MTM loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 
million curtailment gain.

statements. 
Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate was 25.9% for 2023, compared to 21.9% for 2022. The 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related 
to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the 
realizability of the deferred tax asset. The 2023 tax provision was also negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. The 2022 tax provision 
was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service (“IRS”) for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 
months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. However, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including 
interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur. 
During 2021, we filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the one-time 
transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare 
this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of U.S. federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits 
under the regulation. We have recorded a cumulative benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal 
Revenue Code. On March 31, 2023, the District Court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. We continue to work 
towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. Once the District Court enters a final judgment, the 
U.S. government could file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may 
be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.
For more information on income taxes, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements.

Equity Investment
As of May 31, 2023, we do not have any equity investments that are material to our financial position or results of operations. For more information on equity 
investments, see Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Outlook
During 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively impact customer demand for our services. However, we expect operating income 
improvement in 2024 as a result of our DRIVE program initiatives focused on aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent cost structure, and 
increasing the flexibility of our network. We expect international export yield declines and reduced customer demand for our U.S. freight product at FedEx 
Express to negatively impact revenue and operating income in 2024. In addition, we expect expense headwinds in 2024 related to higher global inflation and 
variable incentive compensation.
See the “Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for additional information on our DRIVE program and other cost savings 
initiatives.
Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital 
intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and 
modernize our facilities. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 include our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the FedEx 
Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub.
We will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on 
investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. For additional details on key 2024 capital projects, refer to the “Financial 
Condition – Capital Resources” and “Financial Condition – Liquidity Outlook” sections of this MD&A.
The uncertainty of a slowing global economy, global inflation well above historical levels, geopolitical challenges including the ongoing conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine, and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade, supply chains, fuel prices, and our business in particular, make 
any expectations for 2024 inherently less certain. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.
See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, “Trends Affecting Our Business”, and “Critical Accounting Estimates” for a discussion of these 
and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.
Seasonality of Business 
Our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. Historically, the U.S. express package business 
experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks in October and 
November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, 
have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December, 
June and July are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December through February is the 
slowest period. Shipment levels, operating costs, and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the 
impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our reportable segments. Our 
reportable segments include the following businesses: 
 
FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation, small-package ground delivery, and freight transportation)
 FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (time-critical transportation)
  
FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)
  
FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)
  
FedEx Services Segment FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical 
support, billing and collection services, and back-office functions)
 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other 
FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the 
respected FedEx brand. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. During the implementation 
process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when 
evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In 
the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an 
updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one FedEx.
FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT
The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services 
segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation 
segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on 
the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments. 
Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. 
These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are 
based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. 
Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.
CORPORATE, OTHER, AND ELIMINATIONS
Corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits 
not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our “innovate digitally” strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks 
operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. 
ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx Dataworks during 2023.
Also included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. operating segment, which provides an array of document and business 
services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics, Inc. operating segment, which provides 
integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding. 
The results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
- 56 -
 
In 2023, the decrease in operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to lower operating income at FedEx Logistics due to 
decreased revenue and an increase in bad debt, partially offset by decreased purchased transportation expense. Additionally, operating results in Corporate, 
other, and eliminations were negatively impacted by higher professional fees and outside service contract spend at FedEx Dataworks. The comparison of 
operating loss between 2023 and 2022 at Corporate, other, and eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million 
associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks in 2023.
Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize 
our resources. For example, during 2023 FedEx Ground provided delivery support for certain FedEx Express packages as part of our last-mile optimization 
efforts, and FedEx Freight provided road and intermodal support for both FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. In addition, FedEx Express is working with 
FedEx Logistics to secure air charters and other cargo space for U.S. customers. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe 
approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such 
intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the 
amounts are not material.

FedEx Express Segment Revenue
FedEx Express segment revenue decreased 7% in 2023 primarily due to decreased global volume and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by yield 
improvement.
Total average daily package volume decreased 10% in 2023, and total average daily freight pounds decreased 14% in 2023, due to reduced demand for our 
services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. Volume declines were partially offset by yield improvement, including increases in composite 
package yield of 6% and composite freight yield of 2% in 2023. The 6% increase in composite package yield was primarily due to a U.S. domestic package 
yield increase of 12%, driven by higher base yields and fuel surcharges. Unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted all international package and freight 
product yields in 2023.
FedEx Express Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Express segment operating income decreased 64% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines, partially offset by yield improvement and lower 
operating expenses. During 2023, we implemented cost reductions to mitigate the impact of volume declines, including reducing flight hours, temporarily 
parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, and consolidating routes and closing sorts. The impact of these reductions, while improving throughout the 
year, lagged volume declines, and operating expenses remained high relative to demand. Currency exchange rates had a negative effect on revenue and a 
positive effect on expenses, resulting in a slightly negative effect on operating income in 2023. 
- 59 -(1)

Fuel expense increased 16% in 2023 due to a 27% increase in fuel prices, partially offset by a 9% decline in total fuel gallons. Purchased transportation expense 
decreased 11% in 2023 primarily due to favorable exchange rates and lower utilization, partially offset by higher rates charged by third-party providers. Salaries 
and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume, favorable currency exchange rates, and 
lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by increased wage rates. Rentals and landing fees expense decreased 10% in 2023 primarily due to 
decreased aircraft leases and favorable currency exchange rates. Other operating expense decreased 2% in 2023 primarily due to favorable currency exchange 
rates and lower outside service contract expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Maintenance and repairs expense decreased 6% in 2023 primarily 
due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked.
During 2023, we recorded asset impairment charges of $70 million associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines. See 
“Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” above for more information. Additionally, FedEx Express segment results include business realignment costs 
of $36 million in 2023 associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe. We recognized $278 million of costs in 2022 under this program. FedEx 
Express segment results also include business optimization costs of $11 million in 2023, which includes costs associated with idling our business in Russia. See 
the “Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for more information. 
FedEx Express segments results include $115 million of TNT Express integration expenses in 2022.
FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT 
FedEx Ground service offerings include day-certain delivery to businesses in the U.S. and Canada and to 100% of U.S. residences. The following table

FedEx Ground Segment Revenue
FedEx Ground segment revenue increased 1% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, partially offset by lower volumes.
FedEx Ground yield increased 10% in 2023 primarily due to higher fuel and other surcharges, and a mix shift towards higher-yielding business-to-consumer 
products. Total average daily volume decreased 7% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions.
- 60 -(1)

FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 19% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower 
volume and higher other operating and rentals expense. The 2023 results benefited from certain cost reductions to mitigate the effect of volume declines, 
primarily a delay and reduction in peak wage programs, the consolidation and closing of certain sort and linehaul operations, cancellation of network capacity 
projects, and reduced Sunday delivery coverage. 
Purchased transportation expense decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower productivity and higher fuel prices. Salaries 
and employee benefits decreased 5% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, 
partially offset by higher wage rates. Other operating expense increased 11% in 2023 primarily due to higher self-insurance accruals and higher outside service 
contracts expense. Rentals and depreciation expense increased 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2023 due to the completion of previously committed multi-year 
expansion projects.
FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT 
FedEx Freight LTL service offerings include priority services when speed is critical and economy services when time can be traded for savings. The following

FedEx Freight Segment Revenue 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 1% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, partially offset by lower volumes. 
Revenue per shipment increased 14% in 2023 primarily due to continued focus on revenue quality, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower 
weight per shipment. Average daily shipments decreased 11% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic 
conditions.

FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Freight segment operating income increased 16% in 2023 driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower 
volumes. Additionally, FedEx Freight results were positively affected by initiatives to align costs to volumes and a gain on the sale of a facility during the third 
quarter of 2023.
In 2023, FedEx Freight continued to manage linehaul costs by increasing utilization of company linehaul, resulting in a shift of costs from purchased 
transportation to salaries and employee benefits expense. Purchased transportation expense decreased 25% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes and reduced 
utilization due to the shift to company linehaul. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with 
lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by higher wage rates and increased company linehaul utilization. Fuel expense 
increased 13% in 2023 primarily due to increased fuel prices, partially offset by lower volume. Other operating expense increased 12% in 2023 primarily due to 
higher self-insurance accruals and bad debt expense. Maintenance and repairs expense increased 16% in 2023 primarily due to higher costs associated with 
vehicle parts, outside vendor labor, and facility maintenance.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to lower net income (net of noncash 
items), as well as a decrease in accounts payable and legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities. Capital expenditures were 9% lower in 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on aircraft. See “Capital Resources” below 
for a more detailed discussion of capital expenditures during 2023.
Financing Activities. In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As part of 
the repurchase program, we completed an ASR agreement with a bank in the third quarter of 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common 
stock. A total of 9.2 million shares were repurchased under the agreement. 
- 62 -
 
During 2022, as part of the repurchase program, we completed an ASR agreement with a bank to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock, 
and 6.1 million shares were delivered. We also repurchased an additional 2.8 million shares of our common stock during 2022. 
The following table provides a summary of repurchases of our common stock for the periods ended May 31 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

currently exists. Shares under the program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program does 
not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional 
information.
CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, package handling and sort equipment, vehicles and trailers, technology, 
and facilities. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume 
growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing, 
and actions of regulatory authorities. 
The following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in millions):

Capital expenditures decreased $0.6 billion during 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express.
GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
We are providing the following information in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of 
Guaranteed Securities” with respect to our senior unsecured debt securities and Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2020-1AA (the “Certificates”).
The $19.2 billion principal amount of the senior unsecured notes were issued by FedEx under a shelf registration statement and are guaranteed by certain direct 
and indirect subsidiaries of FedEx (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). FedEx owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of each Guarantor Subsidiary. The guarantees are (1) 
unsecured obligations of the respective Guarantor Subsidiary, (2) rank equally with all of their other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are 
full and unconditional and joint and several. If we sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a 
Guarantor Subsidiary to any person that is not an affiliate of FedEx, the guarantee of that Guarantor Subsidiary will terminate, and holders of debt securities 
will no longer have a direct claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.
- 63 -
 
Additionally, FedEx fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligation of FedEx Express in respect of the $840 million principal amount of the 
Certificates. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Certificates.
The following tables present summarized financial information for FedEx (as Parent) and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after transactions and

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK
In response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the “Outlook” section of this MD&A, we are continuing to actively manage and 
optimize our capital allocation to mitigate the impact of the slowing economy, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical conflicts. We held $6.9 billion in cash at 
May 31, 2023 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion 
three-year credit agreement (the “Three-Year Credit Agreement” and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”), and we believe 
that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include 
operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.
- 64 -
 
As announced on June 20, 2023, we expect to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock in 2024. We executed an ASR agreement with a bank in June 2023 
to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock with a completion date no later than August 2023.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2023 includes $2.6 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment 
strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our 
ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.
Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital 
intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and 
modernize our facilities. Included within our expected 2024 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the 
FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of 
each project. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 also include $1.5 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward 
future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. 
We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, 
lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 6, Note 7, and Note 17 of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 12 of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which 
we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. 
We have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. 
These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant 
long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring 
significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements. 
We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any 
combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future 
offerings, pass-through certificates.
The Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in 
March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements. 
We made a voluntary contribution of $200 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans (“U.S. Pension Plans”) in June 2023 and anticipate making 
$600 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. There are currently no required minimum contributions to our U.S. Pension 
Plans based on current funded status and credit balance due to cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions, which exceeds $3.0 billion. The credit 
balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. Therefore, we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal 
U.S. Pension Plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year. Our U.S. Pension Plans have ample funds to 
meet expected benefit payments.  
On April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 3, 2023 to 
stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2023. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of 
Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there 
any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
Standard & Poor’s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB, a Certificates rating of AA-, a commercial paper rating of A-2, and a ratings 
outlook of “stable.” Moody’s Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2, a Certificates rating of Aa3, a commercial paper rating 
of P-2, and a ratings outlook of “stable.” If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, 
we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing 
may become limited.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make 
significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or 
estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However, even under optimal 
circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information. 
The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative 
accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of these 
critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm. 
RETIREMENT PLANS
The rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Our defined benefit pension and 
postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for expected returns on assets (“EROA”), discount 
rate, and demographic experience such as salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. 
Differences between these assumptions and actual experience are recognized in our earnings through MTM accounting. The components of the MTM 
adjustments for the period ended May 31 are as follows (presented as (gain) loss in millions): 
 
  2023   2022  
Actual versus expected return on assets  $ 2,492  $ 5,109 
Discount rate change   (3,395)  (4,486)
Demographic experience:       
   Current year actuarial loss   142   504 
   Change in future assumptions   110   314 
Termination of TNT Express Netherlands pension plan   —   224 
Pension plan amendments, including curtailment gains   1   (87)
Total MTM (gain) loss  $ (650) $ 1,578 
Our annual MTM adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate and EROA assumptions, which are as follows: 
 
  U.S. Pension Plans   International Pension 
Plans   Postretirement Healthcare 
Plans  
  2023   2022   2023   2022   2023   2022  
Discount rate used to determine benefit
   obligation   5.20%  4.25%  4.21%  3.09%  5.37%  4.35%
Discount rate used to determine net periodic 
   benefit cost   4.25   3.23   3.09   1.83   4.35   2.81 
Expected long-term rate of return on assets   6.50   6.50   2.26   2.39   —   — 
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 50-basis-point change in the EROA and discount rate assumptions for our largest pension plan and the 
resulting increase (decrease) in our projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) as of May 31, 2023 and expense for the year ended May 31, 2023 (in millions):

INCOME TAXES
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income taxes are a function of our income, tax planning opportunities 
available to us, statutory tax rates, and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different 
interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities. As a result, significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in 
evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Also, our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each 
jurisdiction, so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate. Our intercompany transactions are based on 
globally accepted transfer pricing principles, which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international 
business.  
We evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. These evaluations are based on factors including, but not 
limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, audit activity, and changes in our business. In addition, management 
considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences. 
Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Despite our belief that our tax 
return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions 
based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at 
least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest 
benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant 
judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon 
settlement. 
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of 
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We 
evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including 
reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on 
estimates to make this determination, and as a result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we 
do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate sufficient 
future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to 
valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
Our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-
setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. 
For more information, see the “Income Taxes” section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS 
Our self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. Components of our 
self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general 
business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims 
incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, 
seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of 
time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.
We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in  accident frequency and 
severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations. 
Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended May 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 
  2023   2022  
Short-Term  $ 1,730  $ 1,646 
Long-Term   3,339   2,889 
   Total  $ 5,069  $ 4,535 
 
- 67 -
 
A five-percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self-insurance accruals would result in an increase or decrease of 
approximately $250 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended May 31, 2023. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this 
Annual Report.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
USEFUL LIVES AND SALVAGE VALUES. Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 60% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and 
information system infrastructures. 
The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to 
make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated 
over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates 
properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. 
This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. 
For our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected 
salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of 
their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. 
Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a 
material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. 
However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory 
changes, and other factors beyond our control. 
IMPAIRMENT. As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 700 aircraft (including 293 supplemental aircraft) that provide 
delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain 
aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of 
transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our 
global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic 
conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed. 
Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in 
advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly 
those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities 
create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. At May 31, 2023, we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service. 
We evaluate our long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated 
by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the 
asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are 
assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment. Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on 
the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on 
projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for 
disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The 
fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. Such estimates are 
subject to revision from period to period.  
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 
aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft 
fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a 
noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were 
temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 46 MD-11F aircraft and related engines to aid in our 
fleet modernization, improve our global network, and better align air network capacity of FedEx Express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. 
As a result of this decision, we expect a net increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation expense in 2024 with the expense impact in 2025 being 
immaterial. 
- 68 -
 
In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network 
capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record 
depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The 
criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, 
our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping 
seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion 
activities. At May 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to 
revenue service in order to meet expected demand. 
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at FedEx Dataworks for impairment. Based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 
million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the ShopRunner acquisition. For more information, 
see Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
LEASES. We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual 
value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. In accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in 2020, we had $18 billion in 
operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance sheet as of May 31, 2023. The weighted-average remaining lease term of 
all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2023 was 9.5 years. 
Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic 
incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not 
included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to 
extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset 
and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets. 
The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our 
incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency 
environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.
The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair 
value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements 
and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset 
during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party 
appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations. 
GOODWILL. We had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2023 and $6.5 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2022 from our business acquisitions, 
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the 
expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. 
Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires 
management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill 
impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We performed both qualitative and quantitative 
assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. This included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including 
attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within 
the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount 
rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted 
operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. 
As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on 
accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets. 
- 69 -
 
The market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business 
operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the 
estimates of fair value of our reporting units.
In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million ($36 
million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks reporting unit. The key factors contributing to the 
goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of 
operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the 
fourth quarter of 2023.
Our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units 
during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2023 
and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.
LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
We are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to 
multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in 
which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to 
account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make 
determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. Certain pending loss contingencies are described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in 
Note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated 
processes for evaluating these matters. 
Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general 
commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, vehicle accidents, and FedEx Ground’s service providers. Accounting 
guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a non-income tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is 
probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance 
also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management’s judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. 
During the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a 
liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with 
potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
Our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these 
contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes 
regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal 
proceedings and the status of existing matters.
In determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors: 
•the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (e.g., the lengthy and complex nature of class-action 
matters); 
•the procedural status of each matter; 
•any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment); 
•the amount of time remaining before a trial date; 
•the status of discovery; 
•the status of settlement, arbitration, or mediation proceedings; and 
•our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial. 
- 70 -
 
In reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the 
information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may 
impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or 
a meaningful range of possible loss. We update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial 
statements. However, events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our 
previously estimated liability or range of possible loss. 
Despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a 
consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure. 
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
INTEREST RATES. While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we do not have significant exposure to changing interest 
rates on our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt 
(exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $17.5 billion at May 31, 2023 and outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance 
leases) with an estimated fair value of $18.8 billion at May 31, 2022. Market risk for long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting 
from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $743 million as of May 31, 2023 and approximately $518 million as of May 
31, 2022. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar 
terms and maturities. 
We have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these 
retirement plans, as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. Declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded 
status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets would also 
increase net pension expense. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates — Retirement Plans” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information.
FOREIGN CURRENCY. While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, the majority of our transactions during the 
periods presented in this Annual Report are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the 
euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. Historically, our exposure to foreign 
currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, 
such as aircraft and fuel expenses. Foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2023 and a slightly positive impact on 
operating income in 2022. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for 
our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2023, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which 
our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in expected operating income of approximately $236 million for 2024. This theoretical calculation 
assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign 
currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign 
currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. 
We maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in 
currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity which impacts our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. These derivatives are not designated 
as hedges and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income, which was immaterial for 2023 and 2022. 
COMMODITY. While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharges. For 
additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges, see the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL 
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things, defined policies and 
procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information systems for processing transactions, and a properly staffed, professional 
internal audit department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct 
all identified deficiencies. Our procedures for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit and Finance Committee, and 
our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals. 
Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, 
the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). 
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2023. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), the 
independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Ernst & Young LLP’s report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
FedEx Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited FedEx Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, FedEx 
Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on the COSO 
criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance 
sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in 
common stockholders’ investment for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated July 17, 2023 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of 
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the 
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
FedEx Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in common stockholders’ investment for each of the three years in the period ended May 
31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended May 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated July 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated 
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in 
any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing 
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
  
Pension Projected Benefit Obligation
Description of 
the Matter 
At May 31, 2023, the Company’s aggregated projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $26.4 billion 
and exceeded the $24.8 billion fair value of U.S. pension plan assets, resulting in an unfunded U.S. pension 
obligation of $1.6 billion. The net periodic benefit income for the year ended May 31, 2023 for the U.S. pension 
plans was $313 million. As explained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors 
defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain U.S. employees. The Company’s 
projected benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans is measured using actuarial techniques that reflect 
management’s assumptions for discount rate, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement 
ages.
Auditing the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was complex due to the highly judgmental 
nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate is developed 
by utilizing the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds that match cash flows to benefit 
payments, limit the concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to exclude bonds with a call 
feature unless they have a low probability of being called. 
- 74 -
 
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
Audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over 
management’s process for estimating the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, including 
management’s review of the significant assumptions and assessment of the data inputs provided to the actuary. 
To test the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, our audit procedures included, among others, 
evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data 
used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and 
evaluated the change in the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans from the prior year due to the 
change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other 
activities. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for 
determining the discount rate. As part of this assessment, we compared management’s selected discount rate to an 
independently developed range of reasonable discount rates. Additionally, we compared the projected future cash 
flows of the U.S. pension plans to the prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the 
prior year projected cash flows. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including 
the participant data provided to management’s actuarial specialists.
  
Valuation of Self-Insurance Accruals
Description of 
the Matter 
At May 31, 2023, the Company’s self-insurance accruals reflected in the balance sheet were $5.1 billion. As 
explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, self-insurance accruals include costs associated with 
workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits 
paid under employee disability programs. These accrued liabilities are primarily based on the actuarially estimated 
cost of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims.
Auditing the Company’s self-insurance accruals is complex due to the significant measurement uncertainty 
inherent to the estimate, the application of management judgment, and the use of various actuarial methods. In 
addition, the accruals are sensitive due to the volume of claims and the amount of time that can pass before the 
final cost is known.
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
Audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over 
management’s process for estimating self-insurance accruals, including management’s review of the assumptions 
used, results of calculations and assessment of data underlying the accruals.
To evaluate the self-insurance accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and 
accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our 
evaluation of the methodologies applied by management in establishing the actuarially determined accrual and in 
reviewing the Company’s reinsurance contracts by policy year to assess the Company’s self-insured retentions, 
deductibles, and coverage limits. We compared the Company’s accrued amounts to a range developed by our 
actuarial specialists. Furthermore, we compared the Company’s historical estimates of expected incurred losses to 
actual losses experienced during the current year.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services 
through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one FedEx. Our primary operating companies are Federal 
Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a leading 
North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”), a leading North American provider of 
less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. 
(“FedEx Services”), constitute our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, 
customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. 
FISCAL YEARS. Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 or ended May 31 of the year referenced. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are 
wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION. 
Satisfaction of Performance Obligation
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, we evaluate whether two or 
more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than 
one performance obligation. For most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide distinct services within a single contract, primarily 
transportation services. Substantially all of our contracts with customers for transportation services include only one performance obligation, the transportation 
services themselves. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance 
obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. We 
frequently sell standard transportation services with observable standalone sales prices. In these instances, the observable standalone sales are used to determine 
the standalone selling price.
For transportation services, revenue is recognized over time as we perform the services in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the 
customer. Our customers receive the benefit of our services as the goods are transported from one location to another. If we were unable to complete delivery to 
the final location, another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed. As control transfers over time, revenue is recognized 
based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion 
requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery 
contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of 
progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the 
performance obligation. Revenue, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, is recorded proportionally as costs 
are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. For our FedEx Freight and freight forwarding contracts, an 
output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the transfer of control to the customer. 
We also provide customized customer-specific solutions, such as supply chain management solutions and inventory and service parts logistics, through which 
we provide the service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single capability. For these arrangements, the majority of which are 
conducted by our FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. For these 
performance obligations, we typically have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of 
our performance completed to date, and as such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Contract Modification
Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional distinct services. We consider contract 
modifications to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable rights and obligations or alters the existing arrangement. Contract modifications 
that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price 
of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.
Variable Consideration
Certain contracts contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds, and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These 
incentives are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metrics. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we 
expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts of revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, in the transaction price to the 
extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration 
is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an 
assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. 
Principal vs. Agent Considerations
Transportation services are provided with the use of employees and independent businesses that contract with FedEx. GAAP requires us to evaluate whether our 
businesses themselves promise to transfer services to the customer (as the principal) or to arrange for services to be provided by another party (as the agent) 
using a control model. Based on our evaluation of the control model, we determined that FedEx is the principal to the transaction for most of these services and 
revenue is recognized on a gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer. Costs associated with independent businesses providing transportation 
services are recognized as incurred and included in the caption “Purchased transportation” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
Our contract logistics, global trade services, and certain transportation businesses engage in certain transactions wherein they act as agents. Revenue from these 
transactions is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs, fees, 
commissions, and taxes and duties.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets include billed and unbilled amounts resulting from in-transit shipments, as we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance 
obligations have been completed (e.g., packages have been delivered). Contract assets are generally classified as current, and the full balance is converted each 
quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. Our contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue. The full 
balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. 
Gross contract assets related to in-transit shipments totaled $686 million and $861 million at May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, respectively. Contract assets net 
of deferred unearned revenue were $484 million and $623 million at May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, respectively. Contract assets are included within current 
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities related to advance payments from customers were $19 million and $8 million at 
May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, respectively. Contract liabilities are included within current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Payment Terms
Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes and duties, such as sales tax, assessed by governmental authorities. We present these revenues 
net of tax. Under the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, the customer pays at periodic intervals (e.g., every 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, etc.) for 
shipments included on invoices received. It is not customary business practice to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of 
including a significant financing component within our revenue contracts with customers.
Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note 14 for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the periods ended May 31. This presentation is consistent with how we organize our segments 
internally for making operating decisions and measuring performance.

FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CREDIT RISK. We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business services without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade 
receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms, and sales to a large number of customers, as well as the low 
revenue per transaction for most of our services. Allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current 
economic conditions. Historically, credit losses have been within management’s expectations. 
ADVERTISING. Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses 
were $435 million in 2023, $470 million in 2022, and $428 million in 2021. 
CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months 
or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value. 
SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES, AND FUEL. Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances for obsolescence are 
provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete as well as expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These 
allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. The majority of our supplies and fuel are reported at weighted-average 
cost. 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Expenditures for major additions, improvements, and flight equipment modifications are capitalized when such costs are 
determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes 
prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets as they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and 
repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft engine maintenance costs incurred under third-party service agreements. These 
agreements result in costs being expensed based on cycles or hours flown and are subject to annual escalation. These service contracts transfer risk to third-
party service providers and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider as a rate per cycle or flight hour, in exchange for 
maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. We capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated with the development of 
internal-use software, including implementation of cloud computing service arrangements. Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are 
classified within operating expenses and historically have been nominal. 
For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset’s service life or 
related lease term, if shorter. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable. 
The depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions): 
 
    Net Book Value at May 31,  
  Range  2023   2022  
Wide-body aircraft and related equipment  15 to 30 years $ 16,973  $ 15,949 
Narrow-body and feeder aircraft and related equipment  5 to 30 years  2,038   2,163 
Package handling and ground support equipment  3 to 15 years  7,562   6,447 
Information technology  3 to 7 years  1,859   1,907 
Vehicles and trailers  3 to 15 years  3,996   4,004 
Facilities and other  1 to 33 years  8,270   7,621 
 
Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of aircraft costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 30 
years. We periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment.   
Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $4.2 billion in 2023, $4.0 billion 
in 2022, and $3.8 billion in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of assets under finance leases. 
CAPITALIZED INTEREST. Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft, including purchase deposits, construction of certain 
facilities, and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset 
is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $77 million in 2023, $62 million in 2022, and $68 million in 2021.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not 
be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or 
group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the 
difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or internal and external 
appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. 
We operate integrated transportation networks so cash flows for most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a network level, not at an 
individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment. 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 
aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft 
fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a 
noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were 
temporarily idled and not in revenue service. 
In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network 
capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record 
depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The 
criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, 
our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping 
seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion 
activities. At May 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to 
revenue service.
GOODWILL. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses 
acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of 
the acquired business. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to 
determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we 
proceed to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair 
value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions 
on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include both internal and third-
party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter. See Note 4 for additional information.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology assets, and trademarks acquired in business combinations. 
Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or on a basis consistent with the pattern in which the 
economic benefits are realized. See Note 4 for additional information. 
PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial 
techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, 
employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit 
obligation (“PBO”) could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of 
high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. We use the fair value 
of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets (“EROA”) for interim and segment reporting purposes. Our EROA is a judgmental estimate which is 
reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate. 
The accounting guidance related to employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet 
of the funded status of these plans. We use “mark-to-market” (or “MTM”) accounting and immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and 
actuarial gains or losses in our results annually in the fourth quarter each year. The annual MTM adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and does not 
impact segment results. The remaining components of pension and postretirement healthcare expense, primarily service and interest costs and the EROA, are 
recorded on a quarterly basis. Only service cost is recognized in segment level operating results.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
INCOME TAXES. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported 
amounts in the financial statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate 
expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid. 
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of 
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We 
evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including 
reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on 
estimates to make this determination and, thus, there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not 
consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate sufficient future 
taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation 
allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by 
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of 
related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% 
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various 
possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These 
reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, 
and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision. 
We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The 
income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The noncurrent 
portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are recorded in the caption “Other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets. 
SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS. We are self-insured for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, 
general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, 
which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers’ compensation claims, vehicle and general liability, and long-term disability are included in 
accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk. Claims costs are recognized on a gross basis and a 
receivable is recorded for amounts covered by third-party insurance. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based 
on risk tolerance and premium expense.
We are also self-insured for certain short-term employee healthcare claims which are included within other accrued expenses. 
LEASES. We lease certain facilities, aircraft, equipment, and vehicles under operating and finance leases. A determination of whether a contract contains a lease 
is made at the inception of the arrangement. Our leased facilities include national, regional, and metropolitan sorting facilities; retail facilities; and 
administrative buildings. 
Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic 
incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not 
included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to 
extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset 
and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our 
incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency 
environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.

FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. Certain 
real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common 
area maintenance, and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real 
estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and 
lease liability. See Note 7 for additional information.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. Our risk management strategy includes the select use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects of volatility in 
foreign currency exchange exposure on operating results and cash flows. In accordance with our risk management policies, we do not hold or issue derivative 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value, regardless of the purpose or 
intent for holding them. 
When we become a party to a derivative instrument and intend to apply hedge accounting, we formally document the hedge relationship and the risk 
management objective for undertaking the hedge, which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow 
hedge, or a net investment hedge. 
If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
is recorded in other comprehensive income. For net investment hedges, the entire change in the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income. Any 
portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be ineffective, along with the change in fair value of any derivatives not designated in a 
hedging relationship, is immediately recognized in the income statement. We do not have any derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge for any period 
presented. As of May 31, 2023, we designated €151 million of debt as a net investment hedge to reduce the volatility of the U.S. dollar value of a portion of our 
net investment in a euro-denominated consolidated subsidiary. As of May 31, 2023, the hedge remains effective. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local currencies as the functional currency are accumulated 
and reported, net of applicable deferred income taxes, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) within common stockholders’ 
investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are 
included in the caption “Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each period presented. 
EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS. The pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are 
represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 
2, 2015. The agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National 
Mediation Board began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative 
agreement was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express’s pilots for ratification 
during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations. Once ratified, we expect to amend our pension plan offered to 
FedEx Express pilots resulting in a remeasurement of our pension benefit obligation. 
EQUITY INVESTMENT. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at 
cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments 
recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of income. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate 
whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of available recent operating results and trends, recent acquisitions and/or dispositions of 
the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. 
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with 
changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of income.
As of May 31, 2023, such investments were not material to our financial position or results of operations.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The accounting guidance related to share-based payments requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based 
awards using a fair value method. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The value of restricted stock 
awards is based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the “Salaries and employee benefits” caption 
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We issue new shares or treasury shares from stock repurchases to cover employee stock option 
exercises and restricted stock grants.

TREASURY SHARES. In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As part of 
the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a bank in October 2022 to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 
billion of our common stock. 
During 2023, 9.2 million shares were repurchased under the ASR agreement. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR agreement was 
determined based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our stock during the term of the transaction. The repurchased shares were accounted 
for as a reduction to common stockholders’ investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and resulted in a reduction of the outstanding shares 
used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 
In 2023, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $163.39 per share for a total of $1.5 billion. In 2022, we repurchased 
8.9 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $253.85 per share for a total of $2.2 billion. As of May 31, 2023, approximately $2.6 billion 
remained available to use for repurchases under the program. 
Shares under the program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and volume of 
repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on the capital needs of the business, the market price of FedEx common stock, and general market 
conditions. No time limits were set for the completion of the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE. On April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common 
stock. The dividend was paid on July 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2023. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject 
to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our 
ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, 
or advances.
BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION AND REALIGNMENT COSTS. In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the 
company’s long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our 
overhead and support costs. We plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise 
linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced “one FedEx”, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other 
FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the 
respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal 
Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate 
our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx 
picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. 
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground operations and personnel 
in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize both FedEx employees and contracted service 
providers. 
We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs 
were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia. These business optimization costs are included in 
Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express.
In 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 
5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, 
net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business 
realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 
2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023.

FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the 
ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are 
recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. 
Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance 
accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation claims; impairment assessments on long-lived 
assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows; and purchase price allocations.
NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the 
following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.
New Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 
848). In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The standards provide 
optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and 
other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The standards apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank 
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standards were effective upon issuance and can 
generally be applied through December 31, 2024. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from 
reference rate reform as of May 31, 2023, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs. 
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of 
transactions involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those 
transactions on an entity’s financial statements. These changes were effective June 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our 
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale 
Restrictions, which clarifies the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity 
securities. Our historical accounting is consistent with these clarifications. We early adopted this standard effective September 1, 2022. The adoption of this 
standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program 
Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of 
financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The standard does 
not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard 
effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES
We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which 
considers the customer’s established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable 
using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates 
based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss 
reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations. 
Credit losses were $696 million in 2023, $403 million in 2022, and $577 million in 2021. Our allowance for credit losses was $472 million as of May 31, 2023 
and $340 million at May 31, 2022.

Primarily currency translation adjustments and purchase price allocation-related adjustments.  
In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million for all 
of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) reporting unit. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were 
underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and 
revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units 
during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2023 
and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. The summary of our intangible assets and related accumulated amortization at May 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in 
millions):

asset impairment charge related to customer relationships from the ShopRunner acquisition.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $52 million in 2023, $52 million in 2022, and $49 million in 2021.

Interest on our U.S. dollar fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Interest on our euro fixed-rate notes is paid annually. The weighted-average interest rate on 
long-term debt was 3.5% as of May 31, 2023. Long-term debt, including current maturities and exclusive of finance leases, had estimated fair values of $17.5 
billion at May 31, 2023 and $18.8 billion at May 31, 2022. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates 
offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification 
is defined as a fair value determined using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly. 
We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any 
combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future 
offerings, pass-through certificates.
FedEx Express has issued $970 million of Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2020-1AA (the “Certificates”) with a fixed interest rate of 1.875% due in February 
2034 utilizing pass-through trusts. The Certificates are secured by 19 Boeing aircraft with a net book value of $1.7 billion at May 31, 2023. The payment 
obligations of FedEx Express in respect of the Certificates are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FedEx. FedEx Express is using the proceeds from the 
issuance for general corporate purposes.
The following table sets forth the future scheduled principal payments due by fiscal year on our long-term debt (in millions):

We have a $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement”) and a $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the “Three-Year Credit 
Agreement” and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”). The Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes 
a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations 
and other cash flow needs. As of May 31, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreements, no commercial paper was outstanding, and $250 
million of the letter of credit sublimit was unused under the Five-Year Credit Agreement. Outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount available to 
borrow under the Credit Agreements.
Our Credit Agreements contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated earnings (excluding noncash retirement plans MTM 
adjustments, noncash pension service costs, and noncash asset impairment charges) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) 
of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on a rolling four-quarters basis. The ratio of our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 
2.08 to 1.0 at May 31, 2023. 
The financial covenant discussed above is the only significant restrictive covenant in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements contain other customary 
covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the financial covenant and all 
other covenants in the Credit Agreements and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected funding needs. If we 
failed to comply with the financial covenant or any other covenants in the Credit Agreements, our access to financing could become limited.

While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our 
lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx has entered into additional leases which have not yet commenced and are therefore not part of the right-of-use asset and liability. 
These leases are generally for build-to-suit facilities and have undiscounted future payments of approximately $1.8 billion and will commence when FedEx 
gains beneficial access to the leased asset. Commencement dates are expected to be from 2024 to 2026.
FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The 
pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express. 
We are the lessee under certain leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance, and 
lease these aircraft to us. These leasing entities are variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are at 
market at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option, or similar feature that obligates us to absorb 
decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. Therefore, we are not required to consolidate any of these entities as the 
primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary of future minimum lease payments.
NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK 
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The stock is issuable in 
series, which may vary as to certain rights and preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2023, none of these shares had been issued.

NOTE 10: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions): 
 
  2023   2022   2021  
Stock-based compensation expense  $ 182  $ 190  $ 200 
We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock. 
STOCK OPTIONS. Under the provisions of our incentive stock plan, key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of 
our common stock at a price not less than its fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation 
and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to four years, with the majority of our options vesting 
ratably over four years. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. 
RESTRICTED STOCK. Under the terms of our incentive stock plan, restricted shares of our common stock are awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the 
shares expire ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued 
vesting subsequent to the employee’s retirement. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the requisite service period or the stated vesting period. 
ASSUMPTIONS. The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, a risk-free interest 
rate, and dividend yield. The following table includes the weighted-average Black-Scholes value per share of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of 
options exercised (in millions), and the key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for options granted during the years ended May 31, 
followed by a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in the valuation model: 
 
  2023   2022   2021  
Weighted-average Black-Scholes value per share  $ 63.44  $ 80.21  $ 44.11 
Intrinsic value of options exercised  $ 160  $ 150  $ 593 
Black-Scholes assumptions:          
Expected lives  6.4 years  6.4 years  6.4 years 
Expected volatility   34%  32%  30%
Risk-free interest rate   1.68%  0.65%  1.32%
Dividend yield   1.694%  0.983%  1.710%
The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we examine actual stock option exercises to 
determine the expected life of the options. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Expected volatilities are based on the actual changes in the 
market value of our stock and are calculated using daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period equal to the expected life of the options. 
The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend 
yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option.

The 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit 
carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset. The 2023 tax provision was also 
negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. The 2022 tax provision 
was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure. 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act allowed a five-year carryback period for tax losses generated in 2019 through 2021. The 2021 tax 
provision includes a benefit of $279 million from an increase in our 2020 tax loss carried back to 2015, when the U.S. federal income tax rate was 35%. The 
increase in our 2020 tax loss was attributable to accelerated depreciation deductions and voluntary contributions to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension 
plans (“U.S. Pension Plans”). The 2021 tax provision also includes a benefit of $66 million from a tax rate increase in the Netherlands applied to our deferred 
tax asset balances and was negatively impacted by an increase in uncertain tax positions for matters in multiple jurisdictions.
We regularly assess the need for cash in the U.S., as well as in our foreign subsidiaries, and will occasionally repatriate back to the U.S. excess earnings above 
working capital needs that can be repatriated with an immaterial tax cost. We assert all other earnings, both historical and current in our foreign subsidiaries, are 
permanently reinvested and therefore no deferred taxes or withholding taxes have been provided, including deferred taxes on any additional outside basis 
difference (e.g., stock basis differences attributable to acquisition or other permanent differences). Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred 
income tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings and additional outside basis differences is not practicable.

FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows (in millions): 
 
  2023   2022  
Noncurrent deferred tax assets  $ 1,163  $ 1,207 
Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities   (4,489)  (4,093)
  $ (3,326) $ (2,886)
 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets are included in the line item “Other Assets” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
We have approximately $3.4 billion of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions, $1.5 billion of state operating loss carryovers, and $153 
million of U.S. federal operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowances primarily represent amounts reserved for operating loss carryforwards, which expire 
over varying periods starting in 2024. Therefore, we establish valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be 
realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our 
consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the valuation allowance balance during 2023 includes $37 million related to foreign net operating losses and $22 
million for foreign tax credit carryforwards. See Note 1 for more information on our policy for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets and valuation 
allowances. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months 
and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. However, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and 
penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur.
During 2021, we filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the one-time 
transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare 
this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of U.S. federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits 
under the regulation. We have recorded a cumulative benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal 
Revenue Code. On March 31, 2023, the District Court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. We continue to work 
towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. Once the District Court enters a final judgment, the 
U.S. government could file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may 
be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended May 31 is as follows (in millions): 
 
  2023   2022   2021  
Balance at beginning of year  $ 169  $ 192  $ 129

Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions include $211 million at May 31, 2023 and $167 million at May 31, 2022 associated with positions that, if 
favorably resolved, would provide a benefit to our income tax expense. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if 
applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $54 million on May 31, 2023 and 
$55 million on May 31, 2022. Our consolidated statements of income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax 
positions while interest and penalty expense for 2023 and 2022 are immaterial.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals, or 
litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is 
reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. 
However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made. We believe we have 
recorded adequate amounts of tax reserves, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments that may occur. 
NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS 
We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution 
plans, and postretirement healthcare plans.
The accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other 
postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM 
accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. 
The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the PBO of the plan.
A summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

Negative portfolio returns derived due to losses in both equities and our fixed-income assets due to market volatility and rising interest rates. The weighted-
average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 4.21% at May 31, 2022 to 5.17% at May 31, 2023. The 
demographic experience in 2023 reflects an update to our short-term cash balance interest crediting assumption.
2022
Net of all fees and expenses, the actual rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets was -10.8%, which was lower than our expected rate of return of 6.50%. 
Negative portfolio returns derived due to losses in both equities and our fixed-income assets due to market volatility and rising interest rates. The weighted-
average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 3.11% at May 31, 2021 to 4.21% at May 31, 2022. The 
demographic experience in 2022 reflects an update to our mortality assumption and a current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to 
various demographic assumptions.

2021
Net of all fees and expenses, the actual rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets was 12.90%, which was higher than our expected return of 6.75%. 
Positive portfolio returns derived from our return-seeking assets were partially offset by losses from our fixed-income assets due to rising long-term interest 
rates. The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 3.05% at May 31, 2020 to 3.11% at May 31, 
2021. The demographic experience in 2021 reflects an update to our mortality and retirement rate assumptions and a current-year actuarial loss due to 
unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions. 
PENSION PLANS. Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most 
employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account (“PPA”). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a 
dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. 
The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based 
on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). 
Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees. 
We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our 
international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in 
compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands and the United 
Kingdom.  
In 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We 
introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating 
companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for 
pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease 
receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure 
became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.
POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible 
dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, 
if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of 
age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988. Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has 
been reached under most plans, so these benefits are not subject to future inflation.
Effective January 1, 2018, certain of our U.S. postretirement healthcare benefits were converted to a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health 
reimbursement account (HRA) for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the 
company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at January 1, 2018 or upon age at retirement thereafter. In connection 
with this change, retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.
PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; 
expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.

Our U.S. Pension Plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common 
stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status 
volatility, we follow a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities. 
Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter, which we review on an annual basis and revise as 
appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption: 
•the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets; 
•the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect 
those investment classes to earn over time, net of all fees and expenses; and 
•the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if 
investments were made strictly in indexed funds. 
For consolidated pension expense, we assumed a 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets in 2023 and 2022 and 6.75% in 2021. 
The historical annual return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 5.70%, net of all fees and expenses, for the 15-
year period ended May 31, 2023. 
 
The investment strategy for our U.S. Pension Plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of public equities, fixed-income, and alternative investments to earn a 
long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our largest asset classes are Corporate Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed 
Income Securities (which are largely benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays Long Government, Bloomberg Barclays Long Corporate, or the Bloomberg 
Barclays 20+ STRIPS indices), and U.S. and non-U.S. Equities (which are mainly benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index and MSCI indices). Accordingly, we do 
not have any significant concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of 
market indices. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns 
and manage portfolio risk.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value: 
•Cash and cash equivalents. Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents, and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments 
include short-term investment funds, which are collective funds priced at a constant value by the administrator of the funds. 
•Domestic, international, and global equities. Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which 
the individual securities are traded. 
•Fixed income. We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, and other fixed-income securities by 
using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. 
•Alternative Investments. The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent 
lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are 
valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates 
incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables, and performance multiples. 
The fair values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations for our U.S. Pension Plans and our most significant 
international pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table (in millions):

NOTE 14: BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND DISAGGREGATED REVENUE 
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our reportable segments. Our 
reportable segments include the following businesses: 
 
FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation, small-package ground delivery, and freight transportation)
 FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (time-critical transportation)
  
FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)
  
FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)
  
FedEx Services Segment FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical 
support, billing and collection services, and back-office functions)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other 
FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the 
respected FedEx brand. The organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. During the implementation 
process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when 
evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In 
the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an 
updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one FedEx.
Effective June 1, 2020, the results of FedEx Cross Border Holdings, Inc. (“FedEx Cross Border”) are included in the FedEx Express segment prospectively as 
the impact to prior periods was not material. This change was made to reflect our internal management reporting structure. FedEx Cross Border was 
subsequently merged into FedEx Express in 2022. 
References to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.
FedEx Services Segment 
The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative, and information-technology functions in shared services operations for U.S. 
customers of our major business units and certain back-office support to our operating segments which allows us to obtain synergies from the combination of 
these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in 
their natural expense line items.

FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services 
segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation 
segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on 
the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.
Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. 
These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are 
based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. 
Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses. 
 
Other Intersegment Transactions
Corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits 
not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our “innovate digitally” strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks 
operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. 
ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx Dataworks during 2023.
Also included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment, which provides an array of document 
and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics operating segment, which provides 
integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding. 
The results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize 
our resources. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing 
segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated 
results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.

NOTE 16: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS 
In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale, or purchase of real estate, operating assets, or services in the ordinary course of business and 
in connection with business sales and acquisitions, we may provide routine guarantees or indemnifications (e.g., environmental, fuel, tax, and intellectual 
property infringement), the terms of which range in duration, and often they are not limited and have no specified maximum obligation. The overall maximum 
potential amount of the obligation under such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make 
significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification obligations and no material amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the 
underlying fair value of these obligations. As a result of the TNT Express acquisition, we previously assumed a guarantee related to the demerger of TNT 
Express and PostNL N.V., which occurred in 2011, for pension benefits earned prior to the date of the demerger. The guarantee was released in 2023.

The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services. Open purchase orders 
that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the table above.
We have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter (“B777F”) and Boeing 767-300 
Freighter (“B767F”) aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are 
necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is 
limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.

NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES
 
Service Provider Lawsuits. FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as a joint employer of drivers 
employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. These cases are in varying stages of litigation, and we are not currently able to estimate an amount 
or range of potential loss in all of these matters. However, we do not expect to incur, individually or in the aggregate, a material loss in these matters. 
Nevertheless, adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments from the service 
providers and FedEx Ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground 
is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses.
 
FedEx Services Employment Lawsuit. In May 2021, FedEx Services was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Texas related to the termination of a former FedEx Services employee. The complaint alleged race discrimination and retaliation for complaints of 
discrimination under Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After trial, in October 2022, the jury found in 
favor of FedEx Services on the race discrimination claims but awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages of $1.16 million for emotional distress and punitive 
damages of $365 million for the retaliation claims. The court entered final judgment in the amount of the jury verdict. FedEx Services has appealed the verdict 
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. FedEx Services argues on appeal that FedEx Services is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the 
retaliation claims, plaintiff’s claims were not timely filed, punitive damages are not available as a matter of law and, if allowed, must be reduced to no greater 
than a single-digit multiple of the award for compensatory damages based on the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in State Farm v. Campbell, and the 
compensatory damages award must be reduced to conform with the evidence and the Fifth Circuit’s maximum recovery rule. FedEx Services argues in the 
alternative that a new trial should be granted.
 
FedEx believes ultimate compensatory and punitive damages and pre- and post-judgment interest up to $75 million will be covered by insurance, subject to a 
retention of $5 million. An immaterial loss accrual below the retention has been recorded in FedEx’s consolidated financial statements.
 
FedEx Ground Negligence Lawsuit. In December 2022, FedEx Ground was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in Texas state court related to the alleged 
kidnapping and first-degree murder of a minor by a driver employed by a service provider engaged by FedEx Ground. The complaint alleges compensatory and 
punitive damages against FedEx Ground for negligent and gross negligent hiring and retention, as well as negligent entrustment. The service provider and 
driver are also named as defendants in the lawsuit. An immaterial loss accrual has been recorded in FedEx’s consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably 
possible that an additional material loss could be incurred. Given the early stage of the litigation, we cannot estimate the amount or range of such additional 
loss, if any.
 
Other Matters. FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including certain lawsuits 
containing various class-action allegations of wage-and-hour violations in which plaintiffs claim, among other things, that they were forced to work “off the 
clock,” were not paid overtime, or were not provided work breaks or other benefits, as well as other lawsuits containing allegations that FedEx and its 
subsidiaries are responsible for third-party losses related to vehicle accidents that could exceed our insurance coverage for such losses. In the opinion of 
management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of 
operations, or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Environmental Matters. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental 
provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, FedEx 
uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no 
environmental matters required to be disclosed for this period.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
None. 
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The management of FedEx, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 
procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, 
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to FedEx management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal 
executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2023 (the end of the period covered 
by this Annual Report). 
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of Ernst & Young LLP with respect to our internal control over financial 
reporting are presented in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
During the third quarter of 2023, we successfully completed a significant migration to an enterprise resource planning, cloud-based financial system for a 
number of our domestic operating companies, building on the phased migration plan which began with our international operating companies in prior years. We 
implemented new internal controls in conjunction with the migration. During our fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2023, no change occurred in our internal control 
over financial reporting, including the new controls described above, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting. We continue to monitor and assess the effects of remote work on our internal controls to minimize the impact on the design and 
operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Additional migrations to the cloud-based financial system will occur through 2024 and will result in further changes to our internal controls over financial 
reporting. As changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): our Common Stock; our 0.450% Notes due 2025; our 1.625% Notes due 2027; our 0.450% 
Notes due 2029; our 1.300% Notes due 2031; and our 0.950% Notes due 2033.
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
The following description of our Common Stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to 
our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), each 
of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read our 
Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) for additional 
information.
Authorized Shares of Capital Stock
Our authorized capital stock consists of 800,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, and 4,000,000 shares of series preferred stock, without 
par value. On July 13, 2023, there were outstanding (a) 251,187,242 shares of common stock and (b) stock options to purchase an aggregate of 15,900,189 
shares of common stock, of which options to purchase an aggregate of 10,839,182 shares of common stock were exercisable. As of July 13, 2023, no shares of 
our preferred stock were issued or outstanding.
Voting Rights
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters voted on generally by the stockholders, including the election of directors, and 
possess all voting power (except as may, in the future, be provided by Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, or a resolution of our board of directors 
authorizing a series of our preferred stock). Our common stock does not have cumulative voting rights.
Dividends
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for payment of 
dividends, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. The holders of common stock will share equally, share for share, in 
such dividends, whether payable in cash, in property, or in shares of our stock.
Liquidation Rights
Subject to any preferential rights of outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of common stock will share ratably in our assets legally available for 
distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.
Absence of Other Rights

Listing

Transfer Agent and Registrar
The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43006, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3006.
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects
General. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and the DGCL may have the effect of impeding the acquisition of control of us. 
These provisions are designed to reduce, or have the effect of reducing, our vulnerability to unsolicited takeover attempts.
Delaware Takeover Statute. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from 
engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an 
interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales, and other 
transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to specified exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together 
with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock.
Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws require that all stockholder action be taken at a duly called meeting of the 
stockholders and prohibit taking action by written consent of stockholders.
Additional Authorized Shares of Capital Stock. The additional shares of authorized common stock and preferred stock available for issuance under our 
Certificate of Incorporation could be issued at such times, under such circumstances, and with such terms and conditions as to impede a change in control.

Notes, the 2029 Notes, and the 2031 Notes, the “Notes”) is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by 
reference to the indenture, dated as of October 23, 2015, among FedEx, the subsidiary guarantors named below, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National 
Association, as successor trustee (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented, in the case of the 2025 Notes and the 2031 Notes, by supplemental indenture no. 10, 
dated as of August 5, 2019, among FedEx, the subsidiary guarantors named below, the trustee, and the paying agent named below; in the case of the 2027 
Notes, by supplemental indenture no. 3, dated as of April 11, 2016, among FedEx, the subsidiary guarantors named below, the trustee, and the paying agent 
named below; and in the case of the 2029 Notes and the 2033 Notes, by supplemental indenture no. 13, dated as of May 4, 2021, among FedEx, the subsidiary 
guarantors named below, the trustee, and the paying agent named below (collectively, the “Indenture”), which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the 
Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read the Indenture for additional information. References in this section 
to the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” are solely to FedEx and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
The Base Indenture
Merger, Consolidation, and Sale of Assets
The Base Indenture provides that we may not consolidate with or merge into any other person, or convey, transfer, or lease our properties and assets as, or 
substantially as, an entirety to any person, unless:
• our successor is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
• our successor shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and 
interest on the Notes and the performance of every covenant in the Base Indenture that we would otherwise have to perform;
 
 
• immediately after giving effect to such transaction, there will not be any defaults under the Base Indenture; and
• we shall have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that the transaction and the supplemental 
indenture comply with the Base Indenture.
We have agreed that we will not sell or dispose of any subsidiary guarantor whose assets exceed 10% of our consolidated total assets (determined as of the date 
of our most recent interim or fiscal year-end balance sheet filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) prior to the date such guarantee is 
released) (each, a “10% subsidiary guarantor”) unless at least 75% of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition will consist of any combination of:
• cash (including assumption by the acquiror of any indebtedness of FedEx or its subsidiaries) or readily marketable securities;
• property or assets (other than current assets) of a nature or type similar or related to the nature or type of the property or assets of FedEx and its 
subsidiaries existing on the date of such sale or disposition; or
• interests in companies or businesses having property or assets or engaged in businesses similar or related to the nature or type of the property or 
assets or businesses of FedEx and its subsidiaries on the date of such sale or disposition.
Application of Proceeds Upon Release of a 10% Subsidiary Guarantor
In the event that the net proceeds from the sale or disposition of a 10% subsidiary guarantor consist of cash or readily marketable securities, we will apply, 
within 12 months of such sale or disposition, an amount equal to 100% of the fair market value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, of such 
net proceeds to:
• repay unsubordinated indebtedness of FedEx or any subsidiary guarantor, in each case owing to a person other than an affiliate of FedEx (such 
repayment is not required to be made pro rata among all our unsubordinated indebtedness);
• invest in property or assets (other than current assets) of a nature or type similar or related to the nature or type of the property or assets of FedEx 
and its subsidiaries existing on the date of such investment; or
• invest in a company or business having property or assets or engaged in a business similar or related to the nature or type of the property or assets 
or businesses of FedEx and its subsidiaries on the date of such investment.
Modification, Amendment, and Waiver
We and the trustee may modify and amend the Base Indenture with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of each series of Notes to be 
affected (voting as a single class). However, no modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of such Notes affected thereby:
• change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any premium or installment of interest on, such Notes;
• reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or premium payable upon the redemption of, such Notes;
• change any place of payment where, or the currency in which, any principal of, or interest or premium on, such Notes is payable;
• impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on such Notes on or after the stated maturity, or, in the case of redemption, on 
or after the redemption date; 
• reduce the percentage in principal amount of such Notes the consent of whose holders is required for modification or amendment of the Base 
Indenture, for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Base Indenture, or for waiver of certain defaults; or
• if such Notes are convertible or exchangeable into or for other securities or property, make any change that adversely affects the right to convert 
or exchange such Notes or decrease the conversion or 
 
 
exchange rate or increase the conversion price of such Notes, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of such Notes.
The holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of any series may on behalf of the holders of Notes of that series waive any past default under the 
Base Indenture and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on such Notes or in respect of a covenant or 
provision that under the Base Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of such Notes affected.
In addition, we and the trustee can modify and amend the Base Indenture without the consent of any holders in order to, among other things:
• allow a successor to FedEx or a subsidiary guarantor to assume our or its obligations under the Base Indenture;
• add to the covenants of FedEx or a subsidiary guarantor for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of Notes, or surrender any right or power 
conferred upon FedEx or a subsidiary guarantor by the Base Indenture;
• add any additional events of default of FedEx or a subsidiary guarantor for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of Notes;
• establish the form or terms of any series of Notes;
• secure the Notes of any series;
• correct any ambiguity, defect, or inconsistency under the Base Indenture, or to make other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising 
under the Base Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any debt securities in any material 
respect;
• add to, change, or eliminate any provision of the Base Indenture applying to one or more series of Notes, provided that if such action adversely 
affects in any material respect the interests of holders such series of Notes, such addition, change, or elimination will become effective with 
respect to such series only when no such Notes of that series remain outstanding;
• add additional subsidiary guarantors of the Notes;
• provide for the release of subsidiary guarantors as permitted under the Base Indenture;
• evidence and provide for the appointment of a successor trustee or to add to or change any provisions to the extent necessary to appoint a 
separate trustee for a specific series of Notes; 
• supplement any of the provisions of the Base Indenture to the extent necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series 
of Notes, provided that no such supplement shall materially adversely affect the interests of any holders of the Notes;
• make provisions with respect to conversion or exchange rights of holders of Notes;
• comply with the requirements of the SEC to effect or maintain the qualification of the Base Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or
• make any other amendment or supplement to the Base Indenture as long as that amendment or supplement does not materially adversely affect 
the interests of any holders of Notes.
Events of Default
Unless otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture with respect to a series of Notes, an event of default with respect to a series of Notes will occur if:
• we fail to pay interest when due on any Notes of that series for 30 days;
• we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on any Notes of that series when due;
 
 
• we fail to perform any covenant in the Base Indenture and this failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice as provided in the 
Base Indenture;
• we fail to deposit any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of the Notes of that series;
• we or a court takes certain actions relating to our bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization for the benefit of our creditors; or
• any subsidiary guarantor whose consolidated total assets constitute 60% or more of our consolidated total assets (determined as of the date of our 
most recent interim or fiscal year-end balance sheet filed with the SEC prior to such determination date) or a court takes certain actions relating 
to the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of such subsidiary guarantor for the benefit of its creditors.
If an event of default with respect to the Notes of any series occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 
Notes of that series may require us to repay immediately the principal amount of the Notes of that series. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the 
outstanding Notes of that series may rescind and annul such acceleration if all events of default with respect to Notes of that series, other than the nonpayment 
of accelerated principal, have been cured or waived as provided in the Base Indenture. For information as to waiver of defaults, see “—Modification, 
Amendment, and Waiver” above.
Other than its duties in case of a default, the trustee will not be obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Base Indenture at the request or 
direction of any of the holders, unless the holders offer to the trustee reasonable indemnity. If the holders provide this reasonable indemnity, the holders of a 
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method, and place of 
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to any series of Notes.
No holder of any Notes of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Base Indenture or for any remedy under the Base 
Indenture unless:
• the holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default;
• the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series have made a written request, and offered reasonable 
indemnity, to the trustee to institute a proceeding as trustee; and
• the trustee has not received from the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series a direction inconsistent with 
the request, and the trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days.
However, the holder of any Notes will have an absolute right to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Notes as expressed in 
the Notes, or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date, and to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment.
We will be required to furnish to the trustee annually a statement as to the absence of certain defaults under the Base Indenture. The trustee may withhold notice 
to the holders of Notes of any default, except as to payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest with respect to the Notes, if the trustee considers 
such withholding to be in the interest of the holders of the Notes.
Discharge and Defeasance
We may satisfy and discharge obligations with respect to the Notes of a particular series by either delivering to the trustee for cancellation all outstanding Notes 
of that series, or depositing with the trustee, after the outstanding Notes of that series have become due and payable, or will become due and payable within one 
year, at maturity or by redemption, sufficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium, and any other sums due to the stated 
maturity date or redemption date of the Notes of that series.
In addition, the Base Indenture provides that at our option we may:
 
 
• be discharged from our obligations with respect to Notes of a particular series (“defeasance and discharge”), or
• cease to comply with certain restrictive covenants under the Base Indenture, including those described under “—Merger, Consolidation, and Sale 
of Assets,” and certain events of default will no longer apply to us (“covenant defeasance”),
if we deposit with the trustee sufficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium, and any other sums due to the stated maturity 
date or redemption date of the Notes of that series. Upon defeasance and discharge, the holders of the Notes of the affected series will not be entitled to the 
benefits of the Base Indenture, except for registration of transfer and exchange of Notes and replacement of lost, stolen, or mutilated Notes. Such holders may 
look only to such deposited funds or obligations for payment.
The defeasance and discharge and covenant defeasance described above are effective only if, among other things, we deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel 
to the effect that (i) the holders of such Notes will not recognize income, gain, or loss for federal income tax purposes as result of such defeasance and discharge 
or covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner, and at the same time as would have been the case if 
such defeasance and discharge or covenant defeasance had not occurred, and (ii) in the case of defeasance and discharge, the opinion as to tax consequences is 
based upon an Internal Revenue Service ruling or a change in applicable federal income tax law.
With respect to the Notes, “government securities” shall include (1) securities that are direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for the payment of 
which its full faith and credit is pledged or (2) obligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the Federal 
Republic of Germany, the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the Federal Republic of Germany, which, in 
either case under clauses (1) or (2) are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof.
General
We issued €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes on August 5, 2019, €1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes on 
April 11, 2016, €600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes on May 4, 2021, €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes on 
August 5, 2019, and €650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2033 Notes on May 4, 2021. The 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes, the 2031 
Notes, and the 2033 Notes will mature on August 5, 2025, January 11, 2027, May 4, 2029, August 5, 2031, and May 4, 2033, respectively.
The Notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by Federal Express Corporation, FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., FedEx Freight Corporation, FedEx Freight, Inc., FedEx 
Office and Print Services, Inc., FedEx Corporate Services, Inc., Federal Express Europe, Inc., Federal Express Holdings S.A., LLC, and Federal Express 
International, Inc. These subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under our outstanding unsecured debt securities and revolving credit facilities. If we sell, 
transfer, or dispose (by merger or otherwise), other than a lease, of a subsidiary guarantor or all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a 
subsidiary guarantor to any person that is not an affiliate of FedEx, the guarantee of that subsidiary will automatically terminate and holders of the Notes will no 
longer have a claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.
We may redeem a series of the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price described under “—Optional Redemption” below. In 
addition, we may redeem any series of the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, if certain events occur involving changes in United States taxation, at the 
applicable redemption price described under “—Redemption for Tax Reasons” below. We may issue additional notes of any series from time to time at any 
time. The Notes of a series and any additional new notes of such series subsequently issued under the Indenture would be treated as a single series for all 
purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, and redemptions. If the additional notes of a series, if any, are not fungible 
with the notes of that series previously offered for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the additional notes will have separate CUSIP, Common Code, and ISIN 
numbers. The Notes do not have the benefit of a sinking fund. If a 
 
 
Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined below) occurs with respect to a series of the Notes, except to the extent we have exercised our right to redeem 
such Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes of such series, as described under “—Change of Control Repurchase Event” below.
The Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of debt securities which may be issued under the Indenture. Other than the provisions relating to a Change of 
Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture does not contain any debt covenants or provisions which would afford the holders of the Notes protection in the event 
of a highly leveraged or similar transaction. The trustee will not be liable for special, indirect, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or consequential or other similar 
loss or damage of any kind under the Indenture. We and the trustee, and each holder of a note by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the notes, or any transaction 
contemplated thereby.
The Notes were issued in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess of €100,000. The 
Notes of each series are represented by one or more permanent global notes that have been deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of 
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear.
Interest
The 2025 Notes bear interest at the rate of 0.450% per year. The 2027 Notes bear interest at the rate of 1.625% per year. The 2029 Notes bear interest at the rate 
of 0.450% per year. The 2031 Notes bear interest at the rate of 1.300% per year. The 2033 Notes bear interest at the rate of 0.950% per year. Interest on the 
2025 Notes accrued from August 5, 2019, or from the most recent date to which interest on the 2025 Notes has been paid. Interest on the 2027 Notes accrued 
from April 11, 2016, or from the most recent date to which interest on the 2027 Notes has been paid. Interest on the 2029 Notes accrued from May 4, 2021, or 
from the most recent date to which interest on the 2029 Notes has been paid. Interest on the 2031 Notes accrued from August 5, 2019, or from the most recent 
date to which interest on the 2031 Notes has been paid. Interest on the 2033 Notes accrued from May 4, 2021, or from the most recent date to which interest on 
the 2033 Notes has been paid.
Interest is payable annually in arrears on August 5 of each year, commencing on August 5, 2020, in the case of the 2025 Notes, on January 11 of each year, 
commencing on January 11, 2017, in the case of the 2027 Notes, on May 4 of each year, commencing on May 4, 2022, in the case of the 2029 Notes, on August 
5 of each year, commencing on August 5, 2020, in the case of the 2031 Notes, and on May 4 of each year, commencing on May 4, 2022, in the case of the 2033 
Notes, to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding July 21 in the case of the 2025 Notes, December 25 in 
the case of the 2027 Notes, April 19 in the case of the 2029 Notes, July 21 in the case of the 2031 Notes, and April 19 in the case of the 2033 Notes, or, if the 
Notes of the series are represented by one or more global notes, the close of business on the business day (for this purpose a day on which Clearstream and 
Euroclear are open for business) immediately preceding July 21 in the case of the 2025 Notes, December 25 in the case of the 2027 Notes, April 19 in the case 
of the 2029 Notes, July 21 in the case of the 2031 Notes, and April 19 in the case of the 2033 Notes. Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual 
number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on 
the Notes (or August 5, 2019 if no interest has been paid on the 2025 Notes in the case of the 2025 Notes, January 11, 2016 if no interest has been paid on the 
2027 Notes in the case of the 2027 Notes, May 4, 2021 if no interest has been paid on the 2029 Notes in the case of the 2029 Notes, August 5, 2019 if no 
interest has been paid on the 2031 Notes in the case of the 2031 Notes, and May 4, 2021 if no interest has been paid on the 2033 Notes in the case of the 2033 
Notes) to, but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the 
rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.
If the maturity date or any redemption date of a series of the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the related payment of principal, premium, and 
additional amounts, if any, and interest will be made on the next business day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue 
on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next business day. If any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a 
business day, that interest payment date will be postponed to the next date that is a business day.
 
 
Optional Redemption
At our option, we may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable Par Call Date (as defined below), on at least 10 days’ but 
no more than 60 days’, prior written notice mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures) to the registered

no more than 60 days’, prior written notice mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures) to the registered

no more than 60 days’, prior written notice mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures) to the registered 
holders of the 2031 Notes to be redeemed.
At our option, we may redeem the 2033 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable Par Call Date (as defined below), on at least 10 days’ but 
no more than 60 days’, prior written notice mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures) to the registered 
holders of the 2033 Notes to be redeemed.
Upon redemption of the Notes, we will pay a redemption price equal to the greater of:
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and
(2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be 
due if such Notes matured on the applicable Par Call Date (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date), 
discounted to the redemption date on an ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) day count basis, at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) 
plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2025 Notes, 25 basis points in the case of the 2027 Notes, 15 basis points in the case of the 2029 Notes, 25 basis points in 
the case of the 2031 Notes, and 20 basis points in the case of the 2033 Notes,
in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed.
At any time on or after the applicable Par Call Date, we may redeem a series of the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the 
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, with respect to the series of the Notes to be redeemed prior to the applicable Par Call Date, in relation to any 
Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a bond that is a direct obligation of the 
Federal Republic of Germany (“German government bond”), whose maturity is closest to the Par Call Date of such Notes to be redeemed (in the case of the 
2025 Notes, the 2029 Notes, the 2031 Notes, and 2033 Notes) or whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes to be redeemed (in the case of the 2027 
Notes), or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such 
independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be 
appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
 
 
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded 
upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined above) on the basis of the middle 
market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment 
bank selected by us.
“Par Call Date” means May 5, 2025 in the case of the 2025 Notes, October 11, 2026 in the case of the 2027 Notes, February 4, 2029 in the case of the 2029 
Notes, May 5, 2031 in the case of the 2031 Notes, and February 4, 2033 in the case of the 2033 Notes.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest 
thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment 
date with respect to such Notes, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced (solely for the purposes of 
this calculation) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date 
of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption.
If less than all of a series of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the trustee by such method as the trustee deems to be 
fair and appropriate in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any taxing 
authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations, or 
rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the date of the initial sale of the applicable series of the Notes, we become 
or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under the heading 
“—Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to that series of the Notes, then we may at any time at our option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the 
outstanding Notes of such series on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together 
with accrued and unpaid interest on those Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.
Redemption for Reason of Minimal Outstanding Amount
In the case of the 2029 Notes and the 2033 Notes, in the event that we have purchased the Notes of a series equal to or greater than 80% of the aggregate 
principal amount of the Notes of such series initially issued, we may redeem, in whole, but not in part, the remaining Notes of such series on not less than 30 
nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid 
interest on those Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.
Payment of Additional Amounts
We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional amounts as are necessary in order that 
the net payment by us of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or 
deduction for any present or future tax, assessment, or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a taxing authority in the United States 
(including any withholding or deduction with respect to the payment of such additional amounts), will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be 
then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:
(1) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such holder holds 
such note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, or shareholder of the holder or beneficial owner if the holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, 
partnership, corporation, or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as:
 
 
(a) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States;
(b) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of the Notes, the receipt of 
any payment thereon or the enforcement of any rights thereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States;
(c) being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation for United States federal 
income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;
(d) being or having been a “10-percent shareholder” of FedEx as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the “Code”), or any successor provision; or
(e) being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
(2) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary, partnership, or limited liability company, but 
only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the holder, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the 
partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of such additional amounts had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner, 
or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the holder or any other person to comply with 
certification, identification, or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity, or connection with the United States of such 
holder or other person, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by an applicable income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in, such tax, assessment, or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or a paying agent from payments on the Notes;
(5) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial 
interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(6) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains, or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment, or other governmental charge;
(7) in the case of the 2027 Notes, to any withholding or deduction that is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the 
taxation of savings income or any Directive amending, supplementing, or replacing such Directive, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced 
in order to conform to, such Directive or Directives;
(8) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, 
if such payment can be made without such withholding by presenting such note (where presentation is required) to at least one other paying agent;
(9) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of any note, where 
presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment 
thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(10) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner being a bank (i) purchasing the 
Notes in the ordinary course of its lending business or (ii) that is neither (A) buying the Notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Notes for resale 
to a third-party that either is not a bank or holding the Notes for investment purposes only;
(11) to any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor provisions), 
any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof; any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code; or any fiscal or 
regulatory legislation, rules, or 
 
 
practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code; or
(12) in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11).
The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal, or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Notes. Except as 
specifically provided under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts,” we will not be required to make any payment for any tax, assessment, or other 
governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
As used under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “—Redemption for Tax Reasons,” the term “United States” means the 
United States of America (including the states of the United States and the District of Columbia and any political subdivision thereof) and the term “United 
States person” means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; a corporation, partnership, or other 
entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States, or the District of Columbia (other than a partnership that is 
not treated as a United States person under any applicable Treasury regulations); or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal 
income taxation regardless of its source.
Any reference to amounts payable in respect of the Notes herein or in the Indenture shall be deemed to include any additional amounts which may be payable as 
described above.
Change of Control Repurchase Event
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to a series of the Notes, except to the extent we have exercised our right to redeem such Notes as 
described above, we will make an offer to each holder of the Notes of such series to repurchase all or any part (in minimum denominations of €100,000 and 
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes at a repurchase price (the “repurchase price”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate 
principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes repurchased to, but not including, the repurchase date. Within 
30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at our option, prior to a Change of Control, but after the public announcement of such Change of 
Control, we will mail, or cause to be mailed, or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures, a notice to each holder of the 
Notes of such series, with a copy to the trustee and the paying agent, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of 
Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes of such series on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer, the “repurchase offer” and 
such date the “repurchase date”), which repurchase date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant 
to the procedures described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed or delivered prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the 
repurchase offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date.
We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and 
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of a series of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the 
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, we will comply with the 
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of 
the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, we will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the repurchase offer;
(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price for all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the trustee the Notes properly accepted for payment by us, together with an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate 
principal amount of Notes being repurchased by us pursuant to the 
 
 
repurchase offer and, to the extent applicable, an executed new note or notes evidencing any unrepurchased portion of any note or notes surrendered for which 
the trustee shall be required to authenticate and deliver a new note or notes as provided below.
The trustee will promptly mail, or cause the paying agent to promptly mail, or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable clearing system’s procedures, 
to each holder of such Notes, or portions of such Notes, properly tendered and accepted for payment by us the repurchase price for such Notes, or portions of 
such Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note duly executed by us equal 
in principal amount to any unrepurchased portion of any notes surrendered, as applicable; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount equal to 
€100,000 or any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.
We will not be required to make a repurchase offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times 
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by FedEx and such third party purchases all Notes or portions of Notes properly 
tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of holders, the following definitions are applicable:
“Below Investment Grade Ratings Event” means, with respect to a series of the Notes, on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so 
long as the rating of such series of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any Rating Agency) after the earlier of (1) 
the occurrence of a Change of Control, or (2) the public announcement of the occurrence of a Change of Control or our intention to effect a Change of Control, 
the Notes of such series are rated below Investment Grade by each and every Rating Agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade 
Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control 
(and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the 
Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not publicly announce or publicly confirm or inform the 
trustee in writing at our request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in 
respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade 
Ratings Event).
“Change of Control” means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any 
“person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than (1) FedEx or any of its subsidiaries, (2) any employee benefit 
plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by FedEx or any of its subsidiaries, or (3) any underwriter temporarily holding Voting Stock of FedEx 
pursuant to an offering of such Voting Stock, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or 
indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of FedEx’s Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which FedEx’s Voting Stock is reclassified, 
consolidated, exchanged, or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.
“Change of Control Repurchase Event” means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to a series 
of the Notes.
“Investment Grade” means, with respect to Moody’s, a rating of Baa3 or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody’s); with 
respect to S&P, a rating of BBB– or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and, with respect to any additional Rating Agency 
or Rating Agencies selected by FedEx, the equivalent investment grade credit rating.
“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation, and its successors.
“Rating Agency” means (1) each of Moody’s and S&P, and (2) if either of Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes 
publicly available for reasons outside of FedEx’s control, a “nationally 
 
 
recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, selected by FedEx (as certified by a board resolution) as 
a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and its successors.
“Voting Stock” of any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person 
that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of FedEx 
and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, or other 
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Repurchase Event under the Notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness 
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings on the Notes.
If we experience a Change of Control Repurchase Event, we may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase all 
Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered. Furthermore, debt agreements to which we may become a party in the future may contain restrictions and 
provisions limiting our ability to repurchase the Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the Indenture would result in a default under the 
Indenture, which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the Notes.
Issuance in Euro
If we are unable to obtain euro in amounts sufficient to make a required payment under the Notes due to the imposition of exchange controls or other 
circumstances beyond our control (including the dissolution of the European Monetary Union) or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states 
of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the 
international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such 
circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the 
close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of 
conversion, on the basis of the then most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment 
date as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the 
Notes or the Base Indenture governing the Notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in 
connection with the foregoing.
Investors are subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of principal and interest that may have important economic and tax consequences to them. 
Global Clearance and Settlement
The Notes are issued in the form of one or more global notes (the “Euro Global Notes”) in fully registered form, without coupons, and are deposited with, or on 
behalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear 
and Clearstream. Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Euro Global Notes.
Except as set forth below, the Euro Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees.
Beneficial interests in the Euro Global Notes are represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests are effected, through accounts of financial institutions 
acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests will be in denominations of 
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such 
systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. It is possible 
 
 
that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive 
Notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Euro Global Notes, a holder who does not have the 
minimum denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive all of its 
entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.
So long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their nominee or their common depositary is the registered holder of the Euro Global Notes, Euroclear, Clearstream, or 
such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Euro Global Notes for all purposes under the 
Indenture and the Notes. Payments of principal, interest, and premium and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the Euro Global Notes will be made to 
Euroclear, Clearstream, or such nominee, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof.
Certificated Notes
Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the Euro Global Notes are exchangeable for certificated Notes in definitive form of like tenor in 
minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:
(1) the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unable, or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for the Euro Global Notes and a 
successor is not appointed within 90 days;
(2) we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all of the Notes represented by the Euro Global Notes; or
(3) default entitling the holders of the applicable Notes to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and is continuing.
Any note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the 
common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a Euro Global Note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination 
to be registered in the name of the common depositary (or its nominee).
Same-day Payment
Payments (including principal, premium, and additional amounts, if any, and interest) and transfers with respect to Notes in certificated form may be executed 
at the office or agency maintained for such purpose in London (initially the corporate trust office of the paying agent) or, at our option, by check mailed to the 
holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the Notes (maintained by the registrar), provided that all payments (including 
principal, premium, and additional amounts, if any, and interest) on Notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer 
instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will 
be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration 
may be required.
Paying Agent
The paying agent for the Notes is Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch.

component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an insolvency official with

(or such component thereof); or

administrative or operational matters) that the Liquidity Provider, in consultation with the Borrower and FedEx (the period for such consultation not to

with market practice (or, if the Liquidity Provider decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the
Liquidity Provider determines that no market practice for the administration of any such rate exists, in such other manner of administration as the

necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement).

connection between the Liquidity Provider and the United States or such political subdivision or taxing authority, other than a connection arising solely
from the Liquidity Provider’s having executed, delivered, performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, any Operative Agreement,
any such Tax attributable to the inaccuracy in or breach by the Liquidity Provider of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in any
Operative Agreement to which it is a party or the inaccuracy of any form, certificate or document furnished pursuant thereto, (iv) any such withholding
Taxes imposed by the United States except to the extent such withholding Taxes would not have been required to be deducted or withheld from

provided that if the Liquidity Provider decides that any such convention is not administratively feasible for the Liquidity Provider, then the Liquidity

specified in Section 2.02(e), the Liquidity Provider shall have fully discharged its obligations hereunder with respect to such Advance and an
event of default shall not have occurred hereunder. Following the making of any Advance pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.02(c) or 2.02(d) to fund
the Class AA Cash Collateral Account, the Liquidity Provider shall have no interest in or rights to the Class AA Cash Collateral Account, such
Advance or any other amounts from time to time on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account; provided that the foregoing shall not affect
or impair the obligations of the Subordination Agent to make the distributions contemplated by Section 3.05(c)(v), 3.05(e) or 3.05(f) of the
Intercreditor Agreement and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not affect or impair the rights of the Liquidity Provider to provide written
instructions with respect to the investment and reinvestment of amounts in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account to the extent the Liquidity
Provider is entitled to do so pursuant to Section 2.02(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement. By paying to the Borrower proceeds of Advances
requested by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider makes no representation as to, and assumes
no responsibility for, the correctness or sufficiency for any purpose of the amount of the Advances so made and requested.
Section 2.03 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider the fees set forth in the Fee Letter.
Section 2.04 Reduction or Termination of the Maximum Commitment. (a) Automatic Reduction. Promptly following each date on which the
Required Amount is reduced as a result of a reduction in the Pool Balance of the Class AA Certificates, the Maximum Commitment shall automatically
be reduced to an amount equal to such reduced Required Amount (as calculated by the Borrower). The Borrower shall give notice of any such automatic
reduction of the Maximum Commitment to the Liquidity Provider and FedEx within two Business Days thereof. The failure by the Borrower to furnish
any such notice shall not affect any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment.

                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
(b) Termination. Upon the making of any Provider Advance or Special Termination Advance or the making of or conversion to a
Final Advance hereunder or the occurrence of the Termination Date, the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make further Advances hereunder
shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any further Borrowing hereunder, except in the
case of a Downgrade Advance, as provided in Section 2.06(d).
Section 2.05 Repayments of Interest Advances, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance. Subject to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.09
hereof, the Borrower hereby agrees, without notice of an Advance or demand for repayment from the Liquidity Provider (which notice and demand are
hereby waived by the Borrower), to pay, or to cause to be paid, to the Liquidity Provider (a) on each date on which the Liquidity Provider shall make an
Interest Advance, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance, an amount equal to the amount of such Advance (any such Advance, until
repaid, is referred to herein as an “Unpaid Advance”) (if multiple Interest Advances are outstanding any such repayment to be applied in the order in
which such Interest Advances have been made, starting with the earliest), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts
and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the Liquidity Provider shall make a Provider Advance at any time after
making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become
a Downgraded Facility or Non- Extended Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment
to zero, then such Interest Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade
Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the purpose of
determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with Section 2.06 and for the purposes of
Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account for
the purpose of paying interest on the Class AA Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the portion of the
outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination
Advance, being an “Applied Special Termination Advance”) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this
Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a
Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special
Termination Advance (including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance
under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and, provided, further, that if, after making
a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider
Advance shall be converted to and treated as a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity
Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity Provider
agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such
 
19
 
 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity Provider. For the avoidance of
doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest
is not paid when due under Section 3.07.
Section 2.06 Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider Advance shall be deposited in the Class
AA Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e)
and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular
Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider Advance, interest on the principal amount of any
such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance
withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class AA Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f)
of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an “Applied Downgrade Advance”
and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an “Applied Non-Extension Advance” and together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an “Applied
Provider Advance”) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the
Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the dates on which interest is payable; provided, further, however, that if, following the
making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance
shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable
thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account on account of
a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal
to such reduction, plus interest on the principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07.
(b) At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion thereof) is outstanding,
upon the deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause “fourth” of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor
Agreement (any such amount being a “Replenishment Amount”) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the
Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and Applied Special Termination
Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable
Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such Replenishment Amount (if multiple Applied
Provider Advances are outstanding any such repayment to be applied in the order in which such Applied Provider Advances have been made,
starting with the earliest), and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances or of the Unapplied Special
Termination Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount.

(c) Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of
the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class AA Cash
Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance on the date of such replacement
shall be reimbursed to the replaced Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the replaced Liquidity
Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder.
(d) If, at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers written
notice to that effect to the Borrower and FedEx, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) this Liquidity Facility shall
cease to be a Downgraded Facility, (ii) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account and
reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, (iii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, (iv) the Maximum
Available Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to
exceed the Maximum Commitment, and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, (v) the
Borrower shall be entitled to request Borrowings and (vi) the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment and clause (y) of the
proviso in the final sentence of Section 2.02(a) shall, in each case, no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
Section 2.07 Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to provide for payment or repayment to the Liquidity
Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation,
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity
Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement and shall discharge in full the
corresponding obligations of the Borrower hereunder.
Section 2.08 Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid
from time to time in respect thereof; provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect
the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances.
Section 2.09 Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the
amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including
 
21
 
 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
payment under Section 4.02 of the Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower
shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof after giving effect to
the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the
extent available for distribution to it as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is
not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make
payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Section 2.10 Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower and FedEx in writing before
the 60th day prior to any anniversary date of the Closing Date that occurs prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class AA
Certificates (such notice, a “Non-Extension Notice”) that its obligations to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately
following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the
Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the 25th day prior to such anniversary date (but prior to such anniversary date and
in any event prior to the then applicable Expiry Date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and
Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
ARTICLE III
OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER
Section 3.01 Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03, if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any
increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or
maintaining any Advances or its obligation to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the
Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect
thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity
Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its
failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an “Increased Cost”), then, subject to
Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business
Days after delivery to the Borrower and FedEx of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail the event by reason
of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower shall be
obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the
 
22
 
 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence
of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the
effect of any Regulatory Change on the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or attributable to Excluded
Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and FedEx as promptly as practicable upon its knowledge of any event occurring after the date of
this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all
commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the
greatest extent possible, any claim in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such
designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the
Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially
consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to
incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or FedEx agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor in a manner reasonably
acceptable to the Liquidity Provider. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in
respect of Increased Costs, FedEx may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01: (a) in respect of
any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), court, central bank or comparable
agency of the United States or the Liquidity Provider’s jurisdiction of organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date
of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) the frameworks published by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision entitled “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” dated December 2010 (revised June
2011), “Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools,” dated January 2013, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to
have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises through circumstances
peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in
compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity
Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar increased
costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.
Section 3.02 Reserved.

 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
Section 3.03 Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding
for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from
any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant
authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld and, without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.01, if such Taxes are
Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the
Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the
Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required. The Liquidity Provider agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent
with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be
otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider.
If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise available to it as a result of, any Taxes for which
additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the
Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon received from the taxing authority) or net Tax benefit.
The Liquidity Provider will (i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the
Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI
(whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S. taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or
documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from
withholding of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the
Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider
shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish
that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes.
(b) All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be made free
and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts
payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the
appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts
payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the
 
24
 
 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient
to yield to the Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days
after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified copy of (or other
documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.
On or before the Closing Date, the Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9,
evidencing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax and backup withholding, and shall provide an updated Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 upon the Liquidity Provider’s reasonable written request. If any exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne
by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or
beneficial owners of the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of
the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in
the rate of, such Taxes.
(c) If a payment made hereunder to the Liquidity Provider would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
the Liquidity Provider were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirement of FATCA (including without limitation those contained in
Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), the Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower as may be necessary for the
Borrower to comply with the Borrower’s obligations under FATCA and to determine whether the Liquidity Provider has complied with the
Liquidity Provider’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
paragraph, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Section 3.04 Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall make or cause to be made each payment to the Liquidity Provider
under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when
due. The Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account of
BNP Paribas, New York, NY, Swift/Routing No. BNPAUS3N, ABA Number: 026-007-689, Account Name: BNP Paribas, Loan Servicing Clearing
Account, Account #: 103-130-00103; or to such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the Subordination
Agent.

Section 3.05 Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR RateAdjusted Term SOFR shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each
case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.
Section 3.06 Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall
be deemed to have been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such
deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBORSOFR Advance) or reduce the
number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance.
Section 3.07 Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, without duplication, interest on
(i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or
Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral
Account to pay interest on the Class AA Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied
Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class AA Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of
such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or
installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from
and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that
such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may be, as in effect
for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable
law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the
rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued
equals the absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth
in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect.
(b) Each Advance (other than a Provider Advance or a Special Termination Advance) will be a Base Rate Advance for the period
from the date of its Borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Provider’s receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for
such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall be a LIBORSOFR Advance, and an Applied Provider Advance and an Applied Special Termination
Advance shall be a LIBORSOFR Advance from the date of its withdrawal

from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account unless the Borrower otherwise elects in writing that such Applied Provider Advance or Applied
Special Termination Advance, as applicable, shall be a Base Rate Advance.
(c) Each LIBORSOFR Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR RateAdjusted
Term SOFR for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBORSOFR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest
Period and, in the event of the payment of principal of such LIBORSOFR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment
(to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).
(d) Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for such Base
Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a
day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).
(e) Each outstanding Unapplied Non-Extension Advance, Unapplied Downgrade Advance or Unapplied Special Termination
Advance (each, an “Unapplied Advance”), as the case may be, shall bear interest, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date, in an
amount equal to (i) the Investment Earnings on the amounts on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account on account of such Unapplied
Advance during the period beginning on the later of the date of deposit of such Unapplied Advance and the preceding Regular Distribution Date
and ending on the last day prior to such Regular Distribution Date, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest at the Applicable Margin on the amount of
such Unapplied Advance during such period.
(f) Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on
Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus
2.0% per annum until paid.
(g) If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally (other than a
Benchmark ReplacementTransition Event), the LIBOR RateBenchmark determined or to be determined for the current or next succeeding Interest
Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest
error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a “Rate Determination
Notice”) to the Borrower and FedEx. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBORSOFR Advances shall be
converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect
of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination

                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the circumstances giving rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer
apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBORSOFR Advances effective as of the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal.
(h) Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect
to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to as the “Applicable Liquidity Rate”.
(i) Without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, each party hereto acknowledges for the benefit of the other party:
(i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (A) may be subject to methodological or other changes which could affect its value and/or (B) may be
permanently discontinued; and (ii) the occurrence of either of the aforementioned events and/or a Benchmark Replacement Event may have
adverse consequences which may materially impact the economics of the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements.
(i) In connection with the use or administration of Adjusted Term SOFR, the Liquidity Provider, in consultation with the Borrower
and FedEx (the period for such consultation not to exceed thirty (30) days), will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without
any further action or consent of any other party hereto. The Liquidity Provider will promptly notify the Borrower and FedEx of the effectiveness
of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Adjusted Term SOFR.
Section 3.08 Replacement of Borrower. Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrower’s meeting the eligibility
requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective date and time specified in
a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a “Notice of Replacement Subordination
Agent”) delivered to the Liquidity Provider by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes
hereunder.
Section 3.09 Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, such
amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBORSOFR Advance
(but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of:
(1) Any repayment of a LIBORSOFR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance; or

 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
(2) Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBORSOFR Advance on the date for borrowing specified in the relevant notice under
Section 2.02.
Section 3.10 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or
binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, court central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider (or its Head Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or
impossible for the Liquidity Provider (or its Head Office) to maintain or fund its LIBORSOFR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and FedEx
by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBORSOFR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately
upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires
immediate conversion; or (b) at the expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity
Provider will notify the Borrower and FedEx as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is reasonably likely to lead to the
conversion of LIBORSOFR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the
Borrower or FedEx of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to
such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all
commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion, including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if
such designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBORSOFR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall
not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or
cost, unless the Borrower or FedEx agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected,
or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBORSOFR Advances to Base Rate Advances, FedEx may arrange for a Replacement
Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Section 3.11 Benchmark Replacement.
(a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related
Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined
in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings
without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement and the definition of “Adjusted Term SOFR” shall be
deemed modified to delete the addition of the Term SOFR Adjustment to Term SOFR for any calculation and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is
determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of “Benchmark

Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder in
respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such
Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Liquidity Provider without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this
Agreement. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.
(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a
Benchmark Replacement, the Liquidity Provider, in consultation with the Borrower and FedEx (the period for such consultation not to exceed
thirty (30) days), will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this
Agreement.
(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Liquidity Provider will promptly notify the Borrower and FedEx of
(i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use,
administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and FedEx of (x) the
removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 3.11(d) hereto and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark
Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Liquidity Provider pursuant to this Section 3.11, including
any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any
decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its
sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this
Section 3.11.
(d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection with
the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR Reference Rate) and
either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as
selected by the Liquidity Provider in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has
provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then
the Liquidity Provider may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or
after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either
(A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no
longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or

will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Liquidity Provider may modify the definition of
“Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed
tenor.
(e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s and FedEx’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark
Unavailability Period, (i) the Borrower or FedEx may revoke any Notice of Borrowing for a SOFR Advance during any Benchmark Unavailability
Period and, failing that, the Borrower and FedEx will be deemed to have converted any request for an Advance in a Notice of Borrowing into a
request for a Base Rate Advance and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Advances will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Advances
at the end of the applicable Interest Period.

limited to, the Liquidity Provider’s failure to make lawful payment hereunder after the delivery to it by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing
complying with the terms and conditions hereof. In no event, however,

                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Provider’s right to
grant Participations pursuant to Section 7.08(b).
(b) The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without limitation, a “risk participation”) (any
such participation, a “Participation”) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements,
unless all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) such Participation is to a Permitted Transferee, (ii) such Participation is made in accordance
with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, any
laws or regulations imposing U.S. economic sanctions measures or any orders or licenses issued thereunder and any other applicable laws relating
to the transfer of similar interests and (iii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that require registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Notwithstanding any such
Participation, the Liquidity Provider agrees that (1) the Liquidity Provider’s obligations under the Operative Agreements shall remain unchanged,
and such participant shall have no rights or benefits as against FedEx or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity
Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such obligations, (3) the Liquidity
Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with
the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the Liquidity Provider’s rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements,
(4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such
Participation and shall hold the Borrower and FedEx and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless
against the same and (5) neither FedEx nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount under Section 3.01 or
Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The
Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant
or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider
thereunder or in connection therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such
disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and FedEx to preserve the
confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions).
The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Provider’s source of funds may derive in part from its participants. Accordingly, in
determining amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this
Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and capital adequacy requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to
Section 3.03

 Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA)                
                         (2020-1 EETC)                                
as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are commercial banking institutions and of
whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the
Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and
in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither FedEx nor the Borrower
shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a
Participation by the Liquidity Provider.
The Liquidity Provider shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the
name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest under this Agreement (the “Participant
Register”); provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the
identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations) to any Person except
to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Liquidity Provider
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such Participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.08, the Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the
Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemBoard and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in
respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy
the Borrower’s obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the
Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder.
Section 7.09 Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.
Section 7.10 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL
MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to each party hereto at

nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of the Liquidity Provider to
sue in any other jurisdiction.
(b) THE BORROWER AND THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS

claims. The Borrower and the Liquidity Provider each warrant and represent that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and that it
knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation with such legal counsel. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, AND CANNOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THIS
WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT.
(c) To the extent that the Liquidity Provider or any of its properties has or may hereafter acquire any right of immunity, whether
characterized as sovereign immunity or otherwise, and whether under the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (or any
successor legislation) or otherwise, from any legal proceedings, whether in the United States or elsewhere, to enforce or collect upon this
Agreement, including, without limitation, immunity from suit or service of process, immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any court or

such right or claim in any such proceeding, whether in the United States or elsewhere.
