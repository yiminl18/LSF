Item 1.     Business
Oracle Corporation 
provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform andinfrastructure. Our produc
ts are delivered to over 400,000 worldwide customers through a variety of flexible and interope rable IT deployment models, includingon-premise, cloud-based or hyb
rid, that enable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs.Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide 
a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all threeprimary layers of the 
cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise IT offerings include:Oracle Applications, Oracl
e Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software, among others; hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-speci
fic products, among others; and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings worldwide to businesses ofmany sizes, government agen
cies, educational institutions and resellers with a sal es force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs.Our comprehensive and fully in
tegrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS of ferings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalfin IT environments that we dep
loy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployab le to enablecustomers to have shorter 
time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enableinterchangeability 
and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environmentsand the Oracle Cloud; cost-e
ffective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud
 IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scalesystems management and r
elated infrastructure. Our products and services are the build ing blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services andour customers’ cloud IT envi
ronments.In addition to providing a broad sp
ectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and infrastructure products and services to our customers worldwide for use in th
eir global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue ourinvestments in, and innovation wi
th respect to, our products and services tha t we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and servicesbusinesses. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we inves
ted $6.2 billion, $5.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existingportfolio of offerings and p
roducts and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructuretechnologies interac
t and function with one another within IT environmen ts. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operationand integration of these
 differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve th eircomputing performance 
relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from ourresearch and developmen
t efforts and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle suppo rt offerings for their on-premise deployments, which may includeproduct enhancements tha
t we periodically deliver to our products, and/or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.As customers deploy with the Oracl
e Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instan
ces are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, and both are design ed with capabilities to be manageable as one. Our Oracle Cloud atCustomer program provides anoth
er deployment option that uti lizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain OracleCloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a custo
mer’s on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data r esidency, data protection and regulatory business policyrequirements, among othe
rs, while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service.A selective and active acq
uisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products andservices that we can off
er to customers, expand our customer base,

e to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollarsto acquire a number of 
companies, products, servic es and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. OnNovember 7, 2016, we acquired NetSuite In
c. (NetSuite). Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included els ewhere in this Annual Report,provides additional infor
mation related to our acquisition of NetSuite. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to furtherour corporate strategy.
We have three businesses:
 
 
• our cloud and on-premise software business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, on- premise new software lic
enses offerings, and software license updates and product support offerings, represented 80%, 78% and 77% of our totalrevenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, r
espectively; 
 
• our hardware business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our on-premise hardware products and related hardware supportservices offerings, rep
resented 11%, 13% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively; and 
 
•  our services business, which is comprised of a single operating segment, represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.In recent periods, custom
er demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. Our chiefoperating decision make
rs (CODMs), which consist of our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view the operating results of our threebusinesses and allocate r
esources in a manner that is consistent with the changing m arket dynamics that we have experienced. As a result, during fiscal 2017, weupdated our operating segmen
ts. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both 
included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments, includingthe recasting of our se
gment’s financial information from prior periods to conform with the current year’s presentation.Oracle Corporation was incorpor
ated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operat ions originally begun in June 1977.Applications, Platform and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s comprehensive po
rtfolio of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is designed to address an organization’s IT environment needs including business process, infrastruc
ture and development requirements, among others. Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies are based upon industrystandards and are designed to b
e enterprise-grade, reliable, scalabl e and secure. We offer our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through ourcloud and on-premise softwar
e, hardware and services businesses and deliver them through flexible and interoperable cloud-based, on-premise and hybrid deployment models that e
nable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs.In recent periods, custom
er demand has increased at a grea ter rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. To addressthis demand, we have increas
ed our investment in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platfor m and infrastructuretechnologies resulting in h
igher growth of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deploymentsand as customers migrat
e to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their exis ting on-premise workloads. We expect these trends to continue.We believe that off
ering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible an d interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructuretechnologies is importan
t to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models.

tions to help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investment s in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructuretechnologies. We believe t
hat our services are differentiated 
17

Table of Contentsbased on our focus on Oracle techno
logies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services business offers thefollowing:
 
 
• consulting services, which are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our cloud and on-premise offerings inclu
ding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration,application developmen
t and integration services, security assessments and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. W e utilize a global, blendeddelivery model to optim
ize value for our customers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists andconsultants from our global d
elivery and solution centers;  
 
• advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higheravailability 
of their Oracle cloud and on -premise products and services and also include certain other services; and 
 
• education services for Oracle’s cloud and on-premise offerings, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and employees through a varie
ty of formats including instructor-led classes, live virtual training, video-based training on demand, online learningsubscriptions, private even
ts and custom training.Oracle Cloud Operations
Oracle Cloud 
Operations delivers our SaaS, PaaS and I aaS offerings to customers through the Oracle Cloud, which is a secure, reliable, scalable, enterprise gradeplatform that is deploy
ed upon Oracle’s applications, platform and infrastructure products and is managed by Oracle employ ees within a global network of datacenters. The Oracle Cloud enab
les secure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaSofferings via a broad 
spectrum of devices and  leverages automated software lifecycle management to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technologycapabilities as they b
ecome available.Manufacturing
To produce our hardware products th
at we market and sell to third-party customers and that we util ize internally to deliver as a part of our Oracle Cloud operations,we rely on both our internal m
anufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procure
ment, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storageproducts. For all other manuf
acturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partne rs to produce our hardware-related components and hardware productsand we may involve our interna
l manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. Wedistribute most of our hardwa
re products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization ofcomponents across product types, 
centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a “build-to-order” methodology in which products generally are built onlyafter customers have p
laced firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and fullassemblies from a numbe
r of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available.However, we do rely on sole sources for c
ertain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate pot ential risks of disruption to our supply chainoperations. Refer to “Risk Facto
rs” included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to thesources and availabili
ty of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.Sales and Marketing
We directly marke
t and sell our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educationa
l institutions. We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our totalrevenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 
18

Table of ContentsIn the United States, our sales 
and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the Uni ted States, ourinternational subsidia
ries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through adirect sales subsidiary. 
Our geographic coverage al lows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operationsand revenue streams to of
fset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets fo r our offerings. Ourinternational opera
tions subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary of ourdomestic and 
international revenu es and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this AnnualReport.
We also market our produc
t offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the OraclePartner Network. The Oracle Partn
er Network is a global program that m anages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies,including independent softwar
e and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our product offerings. By offering our par
tners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle PartnerNetwork program extends our mark
et reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be suc cessful in delivering solutions to customers globally.The majority of our hardwar
e products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers.Research and Development
We develop the 
substantial majority o f our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property throughacquisitions of businesses and t
echnologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal de velopment allows us tomaintain technica
l control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications thatrelate to various aspe
cts of our products and technology. While we b elieve that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principalbusinesses. Research and developm
ent expenditures were $6.2 billion, $5.8 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or 16%, 16% and14% of total revenues in f
iscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards incomputer hardware and softwa
re technology, changing customer needs and f requent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the cloudand on-premise software and h
ardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to 
maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.Employees
As of May 31, 2017, we employed approximate
ly 138,000 full-time employees, including approximately 39,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 8,000 in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, approx
imately 9,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 5,000 in hardware, approximately24,000 in services, approximat
ely 40,000 in research and development and approximately 13,000 in gener al and administrative positions. Of these employees,approximately 51,000 were emp
loyed in the United States and approximately 87,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States isrepresented by a labor union
; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees.Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our 
quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,which are common in the te
chnology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter andlowest in our first fisca
l quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and on-premise software business and hardware business) aregenerally 
affected by seasonal factors  in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See“Selected Quarterly Finan
cial Data”

Table of Contentsin Item 7 of this Annual Report fo
r a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.Competition
We face intense competition 
in all aspects of our business. Th e nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firmsemerge, expand or are a
cquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change. Our customers are demanding 
less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware. Our ente
rprise cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest andmost competitive comp
anies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation (Mic rosoft), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM),Intel and SAP SE and as well as other compan
ies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers toentry in many of our marke
t segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors rangefrom companies offer
ing broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offe rings focused on a specificfunctionality, product a
rea or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existingcompetitors, as well as f
irms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or ourcompetitors may take 
certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lin es—which invite even greatercompetition in one or mor
e product offering categories.Key competitive factors 
in each of the segments in whi ch we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalability, reli
ability, security, functionality, efficiency, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and the relativestrength of our products and serv
ices versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 
 
•  the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; 
 
•  ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
 
• compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premise IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our OracleCloud environments;
 
 
•  the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
 
•  the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 
 
• operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
 
•  the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
 
•  products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
 
•  products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 
 
•  attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about 
the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.Available Information

We operate in rapidly 
changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot controlor predict. The following discuss
ion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Pol icies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations (I
tem 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefu lly consider theserisks and uncertainties b
efore investing in our securities.Our Oracle Cloud 
strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Pla tform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data as aService (DaaS) offerings, may adverse
ly affect our revenues and profitability.     We provide our cloud and on-pre mise offerings to customers worldwide viadeployment models that bes
t suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT 
model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instances are deployedusing Oracle on-premise of
ferings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues ormaintain the profit
ability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the p
ricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise software product 
and service offerings, which has reduced and could continue to reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near term. If we donot successfully execute ou
r cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and p
rofitability could decline.As customer demand for our cloud o
fferings increases, we experience volatility in our repor ted revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue recognition betwe
en our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscript
ion basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions. The deferred revenuethat results from sal
es of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediatelyobservable in our consolidat
ed statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby newsoftware licenses 
revenues are general ly recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with theinfrastructures and m
arketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with th ese offerings.We have also acquired a nu
mber of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient orscalable as anticipated, w
hich could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, 
integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products andservices.     
Rapid technological advanc es, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communicationsinfrastructure, chang
ing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product in troductions and enhancements characterize the industries inwhich we compete. If we are unab
le to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely 
manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware orcloud offerings or renew softwa
re support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewa ls of these contracts are important to the growth of ourbusiness. In addition, we cannot provid
e any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively forbusiness opportunities in eme
rging areas. 
22

Table of ContentsWe have continued to ref
resh and release new offerings of our cloud and on-premise software and hardware products and services, includ ing our DatabaseMultitenant, Database In
-Memory, SaaS, PaaS, Generation 2 IaaS, Version 12.2 DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adverselyaffected if:
 
 
•  we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; 
 
•  there is a delay in market acceptance of new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services; 
 
•  there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; 
 
•  we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or 
 
•  we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.If our security measures for our products and services are 
compromised and as a result, our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improp
erly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged,the IT services we provide to our customers 
could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulator
y actions.     We are in the IT business, and ou r products and services, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, stor
e, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have areputation for secure 
and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity andsecurity of our products, serv
ices and the internal and external data that we manage.At times, we encounter att
empts by third parties (which may include nation states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and servicevulnerabilities, pene
trate or bypass our security measures, and ga in unauthorized access to our or our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, hardware andcloud offerings, networks and syste
ms, any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential inform ation or data of Oracle or ourcustomers. Computer hackers 
and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack ournetworks, systems, products and 
services, exploit potent ial security vulnerabilities of our networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions andcause shutdowns or denials of servi
ce. This is also true for third-party data, products or services incorporated into our own. Data may also be accessed o r modifiedimproperly as a result of
 customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners,employees or suppliers into d
isclosing sensitive information su ch as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’,suppliers’ or partners’ d
ata or the IT systems of Oracle, its customers, suppliers or partners.High-profile security br
eaches at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-
attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companiesgenerally, it affects Oracle in
 particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the mos t prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oraclebecause of our reputation 
for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow ourcloud 
offerings and store and proc ess increasingly large amounts of data, including personal information and our customers’ confidential information and data andother external data, 
and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularlysensitive data such as hea
lth sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number ofcompanies, 
products, services and techno logies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquiredcompanies, we may still inh
erit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.We could suffer signifi
cant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ or suppliers
’ data, other external data, or our 
23

Table of Contentsown data or our IT systems or if th
e services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or services are perceived as having securityvulnerabilities. Custome
rs could lose confidence in the secur ity and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to benot secure. This could lead to 
fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to add ress andfix these security inc
idents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims andincreased legal li
ability, including in some cases contractu al costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.Our business practices with respect to the 
collection, use and management of personal informa tion could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities orreputational harm as a result of governmental regulat
ion, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy 
issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and becomemore complex, potentia
l risks related to data collection and use wi thin our business will intensify. For example, the European Union (EU) and the United States(U.S.) formally entered in
to a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the Pr
ivacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EU-U.S. Safe HarborFramework, which the Court of Justice 
invalidated in October 2015. The Privacy Shield and other dat a transfer mechanisms are likely to be reviewed by theEuropean courts, which may lead 
to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a p
articular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate, this could give rise to operational interruption in theperformance of servi
ces for customers and internal processing of employee information, regulatory liabilitie s or reputational harm.In addition, U.S. and foreign governmen
ts have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations , or may in the near future interpret existing legislationor regulations, in a manne
r that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other in
formation that is integral to certain services Oracle provides. This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws orregulators take a broad
er view of how personal information is defined, therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may beobstructive to the opera
tions of Oracle and its customers and data providers. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passinglegislation that requ
ires data to remain localized “in country,” as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictionsnot of its choosing and nonstandard ope
rational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes.Regulators globally are a
lso imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in 2016, the EU adopted a new l aw governing data practices andprivacy called the Gene
ral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes effective in May 2018. The law establishes new requirements regarding thehandling of personal 
data. Non-compliance with th e GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other changes inlaws or regulations associa
ted with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal in formation, could greatlyincrease our cost of provid
ing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we operate. Additionally, publicperception and standards r
elated to the privacy of personal  information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect Oracle’s reputation or influence regulators to enactregulations and laws that m
ay limit Oracle’s ability to provide certain products. Any failure, or perceived failure, by Oracle to co mply with U.S. federal, state, orforeign laws and regulations, 
including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception,standards, self-regulatory 
requirements or lega l obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied bygovernmental entiti
es or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.We might experience significant 
coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, software and hardware offerings.     Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the 
lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, software and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that canimpact their 
function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, software orhardware offerings can be 
time consuming and costly. Errors in our 
24

Table of Contentscloud, software or hardware of
ferings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud, software or hardware offerings, could delay thedevelopment or releas
e of new products or services or new vers ions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, andcould adversely affec
t market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If weexperience errors or d
elays in releasing our cloud, software or hardware offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline.In addition, we run Oracle’s busin
ess operations as well as cloud and o ther services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, anyflaws could affect our ab
ility to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, software and hardware offerings and serv
ices to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, software or hardware offerings could expose us to product liability, performanceand warranty claims as wel
l as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.We may fail to achieve our financia
l forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.     Our revenues, particular ly our cloud revenues, new softwarelicenses revenues and hardwa
re revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a “pipeline” syst
em, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor th e status of all proposals andestimate when a customer 
will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline.Our pipeline estimates 
can prove to be unreliabl e both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the “conversion rate” or “closurerate” of the pipeline into c
ontracts can be very difficult to estimate. We may use conversion or renewal rat es in our forecasts for our cloud business that differmaterially from ou
r actual conversion or renewal rates because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable. A reduction in theconversion 
rate, or in the pipelin e itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, aslowdown in IT spending or economic condit
ions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in part icular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed,reduced in amount or canc
elled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in thehope of 
obtaining more favorabl e terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition,for newly acquired compani
es, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or rev enues for a number of quarters following theacquisition. Conversion rates pos
t-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies’ historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates canalso be 
affected by changes in busin ess practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior.A substantial portion of our new softwa
re licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are largerorders. Because a signific
ant portion of our cost structur e is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negativeimpact on our profitabi
lity. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transac tions increases the risk offluctuations in our quart
erly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fallsignificantly short of our 
predictions. We may experience foreign currency ga
ins and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability. 
    We conduct a significan t number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies, particularly the 
Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, rela tive to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results andcash flows, which are reported 
in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other deb t obligations may cause thevalue of the Euro to fluctu
ate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro andmost other major 
international curr encies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreigncurrency results into U.S. Dollars 
and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these produc ts may become relatively more expensivefor foreign currency-b
ased enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency 
25

Table of Contentsvariations can adverse
ly affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affectedwhen the dollar strengthens 
relative to other cu rrencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adverselyaffected when the dolla
r strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreigncurrencies. The U.S. Dollar continu
ed to strengthen relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our results.In addition, we incur foreign 
currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and oursubsidiaries that we expec
t to cash settle in the near term, which ar e charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign currency forward 
contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we ent
er into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in partby gains or losses on the foreign cu
rrency forward contracts in an e ffort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains orlosses. A large portion of our consol
idated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to ou r foreigncurrency exposures, net of ga
ins or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses incertain instances i
f it is not possible or cost-effective to h edge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend ourforeign currency forward 
contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the siz e and type ofcross-currency exposures th
at we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered intoforeign currency forward 
contracts to offset these exposures and other fa ctors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financialposition and cash flows.
Certain of our internat
ional subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary. We have incurred foreign currency losses associatedwith the devaluation of cur
rencies in these highly inflationa ry economies relative to the U.S. Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries orother emerging marke
t countries where we do business.Economic, political and market condit
ions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitability, which in turn could 
adversely affect our stock pri ce.     Our business is influenced by a rang e of factors that are beyond our control and that we haveno comparative advantag
e in forecasting. These include: 
 
•  general economic and business conditions; 
 
•  overall demand for enterprise cloud, software and hardware products and services; 
 
•  governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
 
•  general political developments.Macroeconomic developm
ents like the developments associated with the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union or the occurrence of similar events inother countries that l
ead to uncertainty or instability in econom ic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financialcondition and outlook, which, in turn, cou
ld adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate con fidence in, the globaleconomy or the curtail
ment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending,which could cause customers to d
elay, decrease or cancel pu rchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us forpreviously purchased products and s
ervices.In addition, political un
rest in places like Syria, Ukraine, Iraq, Venezuela and Turkey and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and thepotential for other host
ilities in various parts of the world, poten tial public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic andpolitical uncerta
inty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitabi lity. These factorsgenerally have the strong
est effect on our sales of new software licenses, 
26

Table of Contentshardware and related se
rvices and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscription-basedcloud offerings.
If we are unable to compete effe
ctively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.     We face intense competition in all aspects ofour business. The nature of the IT 
industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves and as delivery mode
ls change. Many vendors develop and market da tabases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications,collaboration products and bus
iness intelligence products, among others, that compete with our cloud and on-premise software offerings. These vendors include on- premise software compan
ies and companies that offer cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitivealternatives to buying sof
tware and hardware. Our competitors that offer business applicat ions and middleware products may influence a customer’s purchasingdecision for the underlying d
atabase in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive product
s, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or formstrategic alliances with other
 companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software in itiatives in which competitors may providesoftware and intellec
tual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.Our hardware business competes with, 
among others, (1) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our c
ompetitors, (2) microprocessor/chip manufacturers, (3) providers of storage products, (4) certain industry-specific hardware manufacturersincluding those serving commun
ications, hospitality and retail industries and (5) cert ain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures. Our hardwarebusiness causes us to compete with 
certain companies that historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business. A signi
ficant portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating systemplatform, which has a
 smaller installed base than certain of our competitors’ platforms and which may mak e it difficult for us to win new customers that havealready made signifi
cant investments in our competitors’ platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitiveposition could result in lower 
revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardwarebusiness.
We may need to change our pricing models to comp
ete successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and generaleconomic and 
business conditions can put pressur e on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or developproducts that the marke
tplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in ord er to compete successfully. Any suchchanges may reduce marg
ins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and ourcompetitors may unfavor
ably impact the pricing of ou r on-premise software, hardware and services offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.Our software license updates 
and product support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licens es fees and netnew hardware products fees, resp
ectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discountour offerings or support pric
ing.Any broad-based change to our pric
es and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing poli
cies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guaranteesof prices and product impl
ementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constra in the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we donot adapt our pricing models 
to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribut
ion may also cause us to change our pricing models.Our international sales and operations subject us to 
additional risks that can adversely aff ect our operating results.     We derive a substantia l portion of ourrevenues from, and have signi
ficant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include cloud operations, cloud, software and h ardwaredevelopment,

Table of Contentsmanufacturing, assembly, s
ales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.Compliance with internat
ional and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.These laws and regulations 
include U.S. laws and local laws which inc lude data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations,prohibitions on payments to govern
mental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Violations of these laws and regu lations could result infines, criminal sanc
tions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitionson our ability to offer 
our products and services in one o r more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage ourreputation, our brand, our int
ernational expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating resul ts. Compliance with theselaws requires a signific
ant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and couldharm our ability to grow our 
business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.Our success depends, in part, on our abi
lity to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investiga te allegations ofimproprieties rel
ating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report ourfindings to government author
ities, but no assurance can be given tha t action will not be taken by such authorities.We are also subject to 
a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization op erating in various countries, including those related to: 
 
•  general economic conditions in each country or region; 
 
•  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; 
 
• difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our cash ass
ets, in that country’s currency; 
 
• regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly impair bank d
eposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay inthese countries;
 
 
•  political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Syria, Ukraine, Iraq, Venezuela and Turkey; 
 
•  common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
 
•  natural disasters; 
 
•  the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
 
•  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
 
•  overlapping tax regimes; 
 
•  our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. at favorable tax rates; 
 
•  public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and 
 
•  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.The variety of risks and cha
llenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and thesales of our products and servi
ces in affected countries o r regions.

ed with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that wewould otherwise have if these 
entities were wholly-owned subsidi aries.Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the 
financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the tim e of a transaction.     We continue to invest billions of dollars 
to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in th
e future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with ouracquisition program inc
lude: 
 
•  our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
 
• we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experi

• an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as weexpected, we may impose our busin
ess practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adve rsely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, orotherwise not realize 
the expected return on, our investments, which could advers ely affect our business or operating results and potentially causeimpairment to assets 
that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; 
 
• our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company ortechnology or that are oth
erwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current orformer customers, for
mer stockholders or other third parties; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships of an acqui red company that we would not haveotherwise entered into, th
e termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (3) unfavorable revenue recognition or otheraccounting treatment as a 
result of an acquired co mpany’s practices; and (4) intellectual property claims or disputes; 
 
• we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,which could result in unexpect
ed litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss ofanticipated tax bene
fits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition;  
 
• we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number ofcustomers decline to r
enew cloud-based subscription contracts or software or hardware support contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products orservice offerings to our 
customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenu es on a timely basis; 
 
• we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines ofbusiness and supply chain infrast
ructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; 
 
• we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and d
elays; 
 
• we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrativefunctions that support new business mod
els, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated; 
 
• we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or simila
r bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans incertain jurisdict
ions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;

 expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse eff ects on our current business and operations; 
 
• our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement ofoutstanding indebtedness;
 
 
• we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and wemay have to delay or not proc

• we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles, in
cluding arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.The occurrence of any of th
ese risks could have a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in thecase of a larger acqu
isition or several concurrent acquisitions.Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could cont
inue to decline.     Our hardware business may adverse ly affect our overall profitability ifwe change 
our business strategies, do not ad apt to changes in market offerings or manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit orother financial proj
ections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including: 
 
• our changes in hardware strategies, offerings and technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services, including our own Oracle Cloud offerings, which could adverse
ly affect demand for our on-premise hardware products; 
 
• our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and on-premise softwarebusiness;
 
 
• our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle SuperCluster products and OracleCloud 
at Customer portfolio, and th e de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our hardwarerevenues because the lower p
rofit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues;  
 
• changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products, including the pace at which weoffer new versions or next gene
rations of our hardware products, and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases of existinghardware products and wait for 
these new releases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues in the short ter m; 
 
• a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and impairments of our inventories;higher warranty expenses than wha
t we experience in our cloud and on-premise software and services businesses; and amortization and potentialimpairment of intang
ible assets associated with our hardware business; 
 
• the close connection between hardware products (which have a finite life) and customer demand for related hardware support in which hardware productsthat approach the end of th
eir useful lives are less likely to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers; and

• we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operatingmargins than our own; (2) have di
fferent legacy business practices and go-to-market strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integrationefforts, which may signifi
cantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) l everage different platforms or competingtechnologies that we ma
y encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquiredproducts within 
our own manufacturing operat ions.Our hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully 
manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will suf fer.    Designing, developing, manufactu
ring and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes. The development process for our hardware products is uncertain and requires 
a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardwareproducts in sufficient volu
mes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our “build-to-order” manu facturing model, in which our hardwareproducts generally are no
t built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in atimely manner. 
These delays could cause our cus tomers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardwareproduct introductions and tr
ansitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation o f new hardware productreleases. It is also possib
le that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws, which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which wehave previously committ
ed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardwareproducts to be returned, re
called or rejected resulting in lost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation effor ts, damage to our reputation,penalties and litigation.
We depend on suppliers to design, dev
elop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the nec essary technologies and components for our hardware products, andthere are some techno
logies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other businessconstraints. As a result, our supply 
chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation, natural disasters, political unrest, portstoppages or other transport
ation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countr ies or regions where these single source component vendors arelocated or where the produc
ts are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or mayexperience 
significant delays or qua lity issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a newsupplier for these techno
logies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect ou r hardware revenues. Wecould also experience f
luctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure. Additionally, wecould experience changes 
in shipping and logistics of our hardwa re products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardwaremargins. These factors m
ay make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to mee t customer demand forour hardware products. Therefo
re, we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchasefewer hardware products fro
m us or hardware products from our competitors. W e negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing processto ensure we have sufficien
t technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventori
es used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary towrite-down the inventory, which would adve
rsely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks desc ribed above occurs, our hardware business and relatedoperating results could be 
materially and adversely affected.We are susceptible to third-party 
manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.     We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly 
and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Our reliance onthese third parties 
reduces our control over th e manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, productcosts, product supply and delivery d
elays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of th e international locations where certain ofthese third-party manufacturers
 
31

Table of Contentshave facilities and operation
s. Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture orsourcing. Any manufacturing disrup
tion or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extendedperiods of time. If we ar
e unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third parties experience d elays, disruptions, capacityconstraints, regulatory 
issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship anddeliver certain of ou
r hardware products to our customers could b e impaired and our hardware business could be harmed.We have simplified our supp
ly chain processes by reducing the number of thi rd-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-partymanufacturers build our h
ardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience p
roduction problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timelyor cost-effective 
manner, if at all. If we are required to change third-party manufac turers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to ourcustomers could be adverse
ly affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, al
l of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business.These challenges and 
risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may bedependent, at least ini
tially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react tothese challenges and risks.
Our cloud, software and hardware indirect sales channel 
could affect our future operating results.     Our cloud, software and hardware ind irect channel networkis comprised primarily of re
sellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network in tegrators andindependent software vendors. Our r
elationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and salesefforts. Our financial 
results could be adversely affected if our co ntracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participantswere to deteriorate, 
if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition oroperations of our channel pa
rticipants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants’ products and services were to decrease. There can beno assurance that we will be 
successful in maintain ing, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may losesales opportunities, custom
ers and revenues.We may not be able to protect our inte
llectual property rights.     We rely on copyright, trad emark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls and 
contractual commitments to protect  our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third partiesmay try to copy or reverse 
engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual prope rty. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated,circumvented or chal
lenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of theclaims we seek, if at 
all. In addition, the laws of so me countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws andcourts of the U.S. If we cannot prote
ct our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropria tion, we may not remaincompetitive.
Third parties have claimed, and in the future may 
claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual propert y rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.    We periodically re
ceive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agre
ements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products orservices or that acquire intellect
ual property like patents for the sole purpose o f monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims ofinfringement and misuse. 
We expect to continue to receive such claims as: 
 
•  we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; 
 
•  the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
32

Table of Contents 
•  the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
 
•  the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
 
•  non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.Responding to any such claim, rega
rdless of its validity, could: 
 
•  be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
 
•  divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
 
•  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 
 
•  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
 
•  require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
 
•  require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
 
•  otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales for
ce, can be disruptive.     We have in the past restructured o r made otheradjustments to our workforce, 
including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues,change in strategies, a
cquisitions and other internal and externa l considerations. In the past, these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increasedrestructuring costs, inc
reased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibi lities. Inaddition, we may not achieve o
r sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effectscould recur in connection wi
th future acquisitions and other res tructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.We may lose key 
employees or may be unable to hire enough qualifi ed employees.     We rely on hiring qualif ied employees and the continued service of oursenior management, inc
luding our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder, ou r Chief Executive Officers, other members of ourexecutive team and oth
er key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, productdevelopment, 
technical and other pe rsonnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or highersales. We may not be success
ful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare ex ceptions, we do not have long-termemployment or non-competiti
on agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons,and we cannot assure you that 
there will not be addition al departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.We continually focus on imp
roving our cost structure by hiring personnel in c ountries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lowercosts. When we make adjustmen
ts to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We 
may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affectour employee retention effort
s and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compens ation program.Our general compensation prog
ram includes restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock options, which are important tools in attracting and retainingemployees in our ind
ustry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate ourcompensation practices and 
consider changes from ti me to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awardsgranted per employee and g
ranting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain e mployees and the amount ofstock-based compensation exp
ense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain andmotivate existing personn
el and recruit new personnel.

Table of ContentsOur sales to government clients expose us to business vola
tility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early ter mination, audits,investigations, sanctions and penalties. 
    We derive revenues fro m contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and their respective ag
encies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies,both domestically and int
ernationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government con tracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by theU.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under th
ese contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, foreign governments and theiragencies are genera
lly subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations whichcould result in various civ
il and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination o f contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeitureof profits, suspension of payments, 
fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.We may not receive signifi
cant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.     Developing cloud, software andhardware offerings is expens
ive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element ofour corporate 
strategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both throughinternal investments and t
he acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and s ervice introductions and shortsoftware and hardware lif
e cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset byrevenue increases. We 
believe that we must cont inue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain ourcompetitive position. However, we do no
t expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. Business disruptions could adversely affect our operat
ing results.     A significant portion of our critica l business operations are concentrated in a few geographicareas. We are a highly 
automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including someof 
our cloud offerings. A major earthquake, fire, other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics)that results in the dest
ruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely af fect our ability to conduct normal business operations and,as a result, our future ope
rating results could be materially and adversely affected.Adverse litigation results could aff
ect our business.     We are subject to var ious legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations, and can divert ou
r management’s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty.An adverse decision could resul
t in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, ope rating results or financial condition. Additionalinformation regarding 
certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere inthis 
Annual Report.We may have exposure to additional tax liab
ilities.     As a multinational corporation, we are subjec t to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in boththe U.S. and various foreign jurisdi
ctions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Weare regularly under aud
it by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns.Changes 
in tax laws or tax rulings may h ave a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, the U.S., many countries in the EU, and othercountries where we do business, are 
actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regu lations and interpretations,including changes to tax laws app
licable to corporate multinationals. In particular, reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for U.S.politicians, and key 
members of the legisl ative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes, any of which could have a significantadverse impact on our ef
fective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions a nd calculations where theultimate tax dete
rmination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) andby foreign tax jurisdict
ions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreementswith the IRS and certain sele
cted bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of 
34

Table of Contentsour intercompany transf
er pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements,these agreements do not cov
er substantial elements of o ur transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have becomeincreasingly contentious. Si
milarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters. In addit ion, our provision forincome taxes could be adve
rsely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.that have lower statutory 
tax rates and earnings being higher than an ticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates.We are also subject to non
-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, valu e-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. andvarious foreign jurisdic
tions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liab
ilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our entry into the hardwarebusiness, which increased the volu
me and complexity of laws and regulations that we are sub ject to and with which we must comply.Although we believe that our inco
me and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assu rance that the final determination of tax audits or taxdisputes will not be differ
ent from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adverse
ly affect our operating results.     Under business combination accoun ting standards pursuant to ASC805, 
Business
Combinations
, we recognize the ide ntifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in acquired companiesgenerally at their 
acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition da te is measured as the excess amount ofconsideration transfe
rred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and theliabilities 
assumed. Our estimates of f air value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete anacquisition, the follo
wing factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: 
 
• costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment orrelocation expenses;
 
 
• impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets, both asset types of which have increased due to our recent acquisitions and may continue toincrease in the future;
 
 
•  amortization of intangible assets acquired; 
 
•  a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; 
 
• identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies o
r the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; 
 
• charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is lo
nger than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure ouroperations or to reduce our 
cost structure; 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.Substantially all of thes
e costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. For example, we re
cognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit. Charges to ouroperating results in any giv
en period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and s ize of our future acquisitions and the extent ofintegration activi
ties. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of M
anagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7).

Table of ContentsThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future 
indebtedness.     As of May 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $57.9 bil lion of outstandingindebtedness that will ma
ture between calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur addit ional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to payinterest and repay the p
rincipal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service suchdebt and the other facto
rs discussed in this section. There can b e no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.We may also need to 
refinance a portion of ou r outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms ofany refinancing may not be 
as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors  at the time of refinancing result inhigher interest rat
es upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interestexpense, our 
ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provisionfor income taxes and ef
fective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debtand equity securities and 
increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition andresults 
of operations. Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could r
esult in significant liabilities and costs.     Some of our cloud and hardware operations ar
e subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials usedfor these 
products, human health and saf ety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labellingrequirements. We ende
avor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with these environmental and o ther laws could increase our productdesign, development, procure
ment, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, chang
e our sales activities, or o therwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws cansubject us to significant 
liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or mor e states or countries andresult in a materi
al adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission h
as adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and go
ld) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end products, we areseveral steps removed f
rom the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certaintythe origin and chain of custody o
f conflict minerals is limited. Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflict-free.” We may also face
 increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.A 
significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of HazardousSubstances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electr
ical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regu lation on Management Methods forControlling Pollution Caused by Elect
ronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues fromthe EU, China and other 
countries with similar en vironmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impactof international envi
ronmental legislation could be significant.Our stock price could become more vola
tile and your investment could lose value.     All of the factors discussed in this section could affect ou r stock price. Thetiming of announcements in 
the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and anyannouncements by us of acquisit
ions, major transactions, or management changes cou ld also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of sharerepurchases or dividends could 
adversely affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or ea
rnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and markettrends unrelated to our pe
rformance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to th e risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result insubstantial costs and diver
t management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.

Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our fiscal 2016 total revenues by 5 percentage points and total operat
ing income by 7 percentage points in comparison to the corresponding prior year period. 
 
Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from ou r net income generated during allperiods presented and the issuances of 
long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017, $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013. Our total assets were also favorably impacted by 
the issuance of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions,repurchases of our 
common stock and dividend payments made in al l periods presented, repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2013, and the repayment of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017. In

Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the date
s listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2017 primarily due to the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 bi
llion, the fiscal 2016 issuance of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings, and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 billionin fiscal 2014, and $5.0

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discuss

f our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgmentsincorporated 
in our reported financi al results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.Business 
Overview Oracle Corporation provides produ
cts and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applicat ions, platform andinfrastructure. Our produc
ts are delivered to over 400,000 worldwide customers through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models including on-premise, cloud-based or hybr
id that enable customer choic e and best meet customer IT needs.Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide 
a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of applications, platfor m, compute, storage and networking services in all threeprimary layers of the 
cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise IT offerings includeOracle 
Applications, Oracle Databas e and Oracle Fusion Middleware software, among others; hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers,storage and industry-speci
fic products, among others; and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offe rings to businesses of many sizes,government agencies, educ
ational institutions and resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs.Our comprehensive and fully in
tegrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we dep
loy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enablecustomers shorter tim
e to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work ; connectable among differing deployment models to enableinterchangeability 
and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environmentsand the 
Oracle Cloud; cost-effe ctive by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the coretechnologies of cloud IT envi
ronments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virt ualization, clustering, large-scalesystems management and r
elated infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services andour customers’ 
cloud IT environments. In addition to providing a broad sp
ectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and infrastructure produc ts and services to ourcustomers worldwide for use in th
eir global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue ourinvestments in, and innovation wi
th respect to, our products and services tha t we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and servicesbusinesses. We have a deep unders
tanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another within IT environments. We focus our dev
elopment efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make themmore cost-effective and easier to
 deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their com puting performance relative to our competitors. After theinitial purchase of Ora
cle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise bypurchasing 
and renewing Oracle support off erings for their on-premise deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to ourproducts, and/or by renewing thei
r SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.As customers deploy with the Oracl
e Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instan
ces are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, and both instances are designed with capabilities to be manageable as one. Our OracleCloud at Customer program provides 
another deployment option th at utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bringcertain Oracle Cloud PaaS and I
aaS offerings to a customer’s on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data residency, data protection and regu latorybusiness policy requiremen
ts, among others, while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service.

Table of ContentsA selective and active acq
uisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquis itions enhance the products andservices that we can off
er to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increasestockholder value. In rec
ent years, we have invested bill ions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, arecomplementary to, or hav
e otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. On November 7, 2016, we acquired NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite). Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial State
ments, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our acquisition of NetSuite. We expect tocontinue to acquire comp
anies, products, services and technologies to furthe r our corporate strategy.In recent periods, custom
er demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models rela tive to on-premise IT deployment models. To addressthis demand, we have increas
ed our investment in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platform and infrastructuretechnologies 
resulting in higher growth of our Sa aS, PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and ascustomers migrate to 
and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads. We expect these trends to con tinue. We believe that offeringcustomers broad, comprehens
ive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is important to ourgrowth strategy and better 
addresses customer needs r elative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models.We enable customers to 
evolve and transform to substantially any IT deployment model at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. We have three businesses: 
cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services, each of which comprises a single operating segment. Our chie f operatingdecision makers (CODMs), which include ou
r Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view the operating results of our three businesses andallocate resources 
in a manner that is consistent with the changing market dynam ics that we have experienced in recent periods. As a result, during fiscal 2017, weupdated our operating segmen
ts. The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below provides the current view that is utilized by our CODMs to evaluate pe
rformance and determine resource allocations. In addition to the discussion below, Note 16 of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements, in
cluded elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional informat ion related to our businesses and operating segments, including therecasting of our segments
’ financial information from prior periods to conform to the current year’s presentation.Cloud and On-Premise Software Business
Our cloud and on-premise softwar
e line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies throughour cloud and on-premise softwa
re offerings. Our cloud and on-premise software revenues repres ented 80%, 78% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017,2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings d
eliver applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we host,manage and support and that cus
tomers access by entering into a subscript ion agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include OracleManaged Cloud Services, which are des
igned to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid IT infr
astructure for a stated period. Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive torenew these contracts when th
ey are eligible for renewal.We offer customers th
e ability to license our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others, for on-premise and other 
IT environments. Our new software license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and the timing of a few large software licensetransactions can substant
ially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues, which is differen t than the typical revenue recognition for our cloud-basedofferings for which revenues 
are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. New software license customers have the option to purchasesoftware license updates 
and product support contracts, which grant rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released duringthe term of the support pe
riod, as well as technical support assistance. Our software 
42

Table of Contentslicense updates and product suppo
rt contracts are generally one year in duration and are generally billed in advance of the service being performed.Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and new softwa
re licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions,governmental budgetary cons
traints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud contractswith our existing customers and 
foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed signif icant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS,PaaS and IaaS revenues, which repres
ented 12%, 8% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This emphasis hasaffected the 
growth of our new software licenses revenues, and to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product supportrevenues. We expect thes
e trends will continue with the mix of revenues continuing to shift toward cloud-based services for this business.Our software license updates 
and product support revenues growth is primarily influenced by four factors: (1) the per centage of our software support contractcustomer base that ren
ews its software support contracts; (2) the pricing of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new softwarelicenses; 
(3) the pricing of new softwar e licenses sold; and (4) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Substantiallyall of our customers purch
ase software license updates and product support contracts when they acquire on-premis e new software licenses and renew their softwarelicense updates and product suppo
rt contracts annually in order to benefit from Oracle’s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of periodicsoftware updates that ar
e released and that customers with current software support contracts are entitled to.On a constant currency basis, 
we expect that our total cloud and on-premise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to: 
 
•  expected growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; 
 
• continued demand for our on-premise software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage ofcustomers that renew the
ir software license updates and product support contracts; and 
 
•  contributions from our acquisitions.We believe all of th
ese factors should contribute to growing our cloud and on-premise software revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investmentsin research and developm
ent.Our cloud and on-premise softwar
e business’ segment margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward t
rend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business aregenerally fixed in the sho
rt term.Hardware Business
Our 
hardware business represented 11%, 13% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our hardware business provides a broadselection of hardware produ
cts and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, sto rage, industry-specific hardware,virtualization softwa
re, operating systems, management software and related hardware services including hardware support. We expect to make investments inresearch and developmen
t to improve existing hardware p roducts and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardwareproducts are sold through indir
ect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide custo mers withsoftware updates for softwar
e components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other softwareproducts, and can include produc
t repairs, maintenance servic es and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage ofthe net hardware products f
ees.We generally expect ou
r hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due tothe incremental cos
ts we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. 
43

Table of ContentsOur quarterly hardware rev
enues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating marg ins that we report are affected by:our ability to timely 
manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products; the strengthof general economic and 
business conditions; government al budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in closeproximity to the time o
f hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contr acts and the closeassociation between hardwar
e products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisionsto either maintain o
r upgrade their existing hardware infras tructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreigncurrency rate fluctuations.
Services Business
Our services business helps custom
ers and partners maximize the performance of their i nvestments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.We believe that our se
rvices are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual prope rty and bestpractices. Our services o
fferings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 9% of our total revenues in each offiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our services busin
ess has lower segment margins than ou r cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our servicesrevenues are impact
ed by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personn
el reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis on growing ourcloud revenues, and customer d
emand for our cloud and on-premise software and hardware offe rings.Acquisitions
Our selective and activ
e acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquirea number of complement
ary companies, products, services and techno logies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 and MICROS in fiscal 2015.We expect to continue to 
acquire companies, products, services and techno logies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in
cluded elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions.We believe that we can 
fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from 
the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operatingmargin, cash flow and return on 
invested capital targets before deciding to move fo rward with an acquisition.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financia
l statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the FinancialAccounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codi
fication (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicableguidance issued by the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make cert ain estimates, judgments andassumptions. We believe th
at the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time thatthese estimates, judgments 
and assumptions are made. Thes e estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as ofthe date of the financ
ial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the exte nt that there are differencesbetween these estimates, j
udgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our moresignificant estima
tes, judgments and assumptions and which we believe a re the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financialresults include:
 
 
•  Revenue Recognition; 
 
•  Business Combinations; 
44

Table of Contents 
•  Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; 
 
•  Accounting for Income Taxes; and 
 
•  Legal and Other Contingencies.In many cases, the account
ing treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application.There are also areas 
in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our seniormanagement has reviewed ou
r critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
 
• cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, which generally grant customers access to abroad range of our applica
tions, platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure,standards-based cloud comput
ing environment; new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database,middleware, applicat
ions and industry-specific software products; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); 
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, and storage products, andindustry-specific hardwa
re; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud, software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support andeducation services.
Revenues generally are r
ecognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Off
erings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elem ents)Our revenue recognition poli
cy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, h ardware support and relatedservices is based upon the ac

rally provide customers access to certain of our software and/or infrastructure within a cloud-based IT environmentthat we manage, host and support and o

and hardware related IT infrastructure. Revenues for our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract termcommencing with the date 
the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criter ia have been satisfied.Revenues from the sale of ha

Arrangements)
We enter into arrangements 
with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of oneanother (referred to as no
n-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as aseparate unit 
of accounting provided the fo llowing criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for anarrangement that in
cludes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or pe rformance of the undelivered product or service isconsidered probable and is subst
antially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us oranother 
vendor or could be resold by the cus tomer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the deliveredproducts. Where the aforeme
ntioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combin ed with the undelivered element(s) and treatedas a single unit of account
ing for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that includemore than one 
deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in thecase of our cloud offerings, we g
enerally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purpos es of revenue classificationof the elements that 
are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements ofoperations based 
on a rational and consisten t methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.For our non-software 
multiple-element arrangements, we  allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. Theselling price for ea
ch element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, orestimated selling pr
ice (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangiblehardware product includes sof
tware, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essentialfunctionality and, if so, th
e entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each sep arate unit ofaccounting for each of th
e non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit theamount of revenue recogni
zed for delivered elements to an amount th at is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of anyspecified performan
ce conditions.When possible, we establish VSOE of selling p
rice for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for adeliverable when sold separ
ately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPEis established by evaluat
ing similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we areunable to determine th
e selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewinghistorical transac
tions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a s tandalone basis and considering several other external and internal factorsincluding, but not limited 
to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the 
type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of theproduct lifecycle. The d
etermination of ESP is made through consultation with and approv al by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model andgo-to-market strat
egy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future,

Revenue Recognition for Software Produc
ts and Software Related Services (Software Elements)New software licenses revenues p
rimarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, applications and industry- specific software produc
ts and exclude cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in softwarelicense updates and product suppo
rt revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recogn ition is substantially governed by the accounting guidancecontained in ASC 985-605, 
Software-Revenue
Recognition.
 We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount ofsoftware 
and software related se rvices revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.For software license arr
angements that do not require significant modific ation or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licensesrevenues when: (1) we enter in
to a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale pr ice is fixed ordeterminable and free of conti
ngencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not 
met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.Substantially all of our sof
tware license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (forexample, in agreemen
ts with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that arereferenced in the current agreement
 and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctoryand all other revenue r
ecognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for examp le, acceptance provisions that are long-term innature or are not include
d as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration ofthe acceptance 
period. The vast majority of our sof
tware license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related f
ees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights tounspecified software produc
t upgrades, maintenance rele ases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access totechnical content, as we
ll as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts a re generallypriced as a percentag
e of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of ourcustomers renew their sof
tware license updates and product support contracts annu ally.Revenue

the sale of our software produ cts, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software licensedelivery is followed by the subsequ
ent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we haveapplied the residual m
ethod to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, iffair value exists for 
undelivered elements in a m ultiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion ofthe arrangement consideration
 generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a  software related multiple-element arrangem

ElementsMany of our software arrange
ments include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting rev
enues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because thearrangements qualify 
as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant f actors considered in determining whether the revenues should beaccounted for separat
ely include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of 
services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software licensefee. Revenues for consulting se
rvices are generally recognized as the services are perfor med. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion orreceipt of payment for the c
onsulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “no
t to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. Ifwe do not have a sufficient bas
is to measure progress towards completion, re venues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that theservices have been complete
d. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened d
aily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relatingto the assumptions, risks and unce
rtainties inherent with the application of the propor tional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues andrelated expenses repor
ted in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variance
s and specification and testing requirement changes.Our advanced customer support se
rvices are offered as standa lone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-softwareproducts and services. We of
fer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performan ce and higheravailability of the
ir products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services areperformed or ratably ov
er the term of the service period, which is generally one year o r less.Education revenues are a
lso a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based tra ining in the use of our cloud, software andhardware products. Education r
evenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.If an arrangement con
tains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licensesrevenues and/or hardware produ
cts revenues, including the costs of hardwar e products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contractaccounting using either
 the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. 
48

Table of ContentsWe also evaluate ar
rangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for conv enience” provisions, when such provisions arerequired by law, to determ
ine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions,the 
“essential use” of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If wedetermine upon execution o
f these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize  revenues once all of the criteria described abovehave been met. If such a de
termination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision bythe 
governmental entity.We assess whether fees
 are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirem ents are met. Our standardpayment terms are ne
t 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard paymentterms based on whether we have suc
cessful collection history on comp arable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics)and, if so, generally
 conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrang
ements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term finan cing tocreditworthy customers pr
imarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history ofcollection, without concess
ions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally e xtend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenuerecognition criter
ia have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from fin
ancing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-partyfinancing institutions with
in 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in ourconsolidated statemen
ts of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers
and
Servicing
 , as we are considered to have surrende
red control of these financing receivables.Our customers include sever
al of our suppliers and, occasiona lly, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the sametime that we have sold our produ
cts to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales o f services thatoccur within a three-mon
th time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accountingtreatment and disclosu
re. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms weconsider to be at arm’s 
length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acqui
red are necessary for our current operations.Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, 
Business
Combinations
 , in accounting for our acquis itions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired and the liabi
lities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferredover the net of the acquis
ition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinem
ent. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assetsacquired and liabili
ties assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon th e conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values ofassets acquired or liab
ilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinat
ions requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the a cquisition date, including ourestimates for intang
ible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although webelieve that the assump
tions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part 
49

Table of Contentson historical experience an
d information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.Examples of critical estimates in
 valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: 
 
• future expected cash flows from assumed cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, software support contracts and hardware support contracts for which ourfuture expected cash f
low estimates include estimated cash flow amounts and time periods over which such cash flows are expected to be received,estimated retent
ion and renewal rates of existing customer contracts assumed as a part of the acquisition, and estima ted costs to sell, market, deliver andsupport such assumed contracts, 
among other estimates; 
 
• future expected cash flows from acquired developed technology including estimated amounts to be received for such developed technology and the timeperiod over which such cash flows ar
e expected to be received, among other estimates; and 
 
•  discount rates.Unanticipated events and c
ircumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We estimate the f
air values of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed as part of an acquisition. The estim
ated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determinesfair value by estima
ting the costs related to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal pro fit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligationsare based on the historic
al direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approxi
mates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include anycosts associated with sell
ing efforts or research and development or the related fulfill ment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts isexcluded because the acqu
ired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do notinclude the estimated research a
nd development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time ofacquisition. As a result of our 
fair value estimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certa in cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates andproduct support and hardware support 
revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon deliveryof the 
contractual obligat ions (refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of ourcustomers, including custom
ers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product suppo rt contracts when the contracts are eligible forrenewal, and we strive to ren
ew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts when they are eligible for renewal. To the extent customers towhich 
these contractual obl igations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respectivecontracts’ renewal periods.
In connection with a business comb
ination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management.Restructuring costs are typ
ically comprised of employee se verance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuringexpenses are based upon plans tha
t have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to ex it orrestructure cert
ain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit
or
Disposal
Cost
Obligations.
 A liability for costs associated with an 
exit or disposal activity is recogniz ed and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in whichthe liability is incurred. W
hen estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub -lease payments to bereceived, which can differ
 materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operationsand financial position in 
the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may id
entify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingenci
es throughout the measurement period in

Table of Contentsorder to obtain suffici
ent information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumedand, if so, to determine 
their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably det
ermine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement pe riod, which isgenerally the case giv
en the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted or a liabili
ty had been incurred at the acquis ition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to themeasurement period, ch
anges in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of op erations and financialposition.
In addition, uncertain t
ax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business comb ination are initially estimated as of theacquisition date. We r
eevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourpreliminary 
estimates being reco rded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination ofthe tax allowance’s or con
tingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax posi tions and tax related valuation allowances willaffect our provision for 
income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments
We review goodwill for impa
irment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordancewith ASC 350, 
Intangibles—Goodwill
and
 Other
 . According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qua litative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill forimpairment or we can di
rectly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value o f a reporting unit ismore likely than not (i.
e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will beperformed. In the firs
t step, we compare the fair value of each r eporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value ofthe net assets assigned to th
at unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carry ing value of the net assetsassigned to the reporting uni
t exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine theimplied fair value o
f the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the car rying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record animpairment loss equal 
to the difference.Determining the fair v
alue of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growthrates and operating ma
rgins used to calculate projected future cash fl ows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determinationof appropriate marke
t comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently un certain. Actualfuture results may dif
fer from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine thecarrying values for ea
ch of our reporting units. We completed the requ
ired annual testing of goodwill for impairment as of March 1, 2017 prior to our operating segment changes. We also subsequently performed a goodwill impairment t
est after such changes had been effected. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any goodwill impairmentcharges, nor did we recognize 
any impairment charges in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million related to our hardwarebusiness. All of our reporting units h
ad fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review. We make judgments about th
e recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment  mayexist. Each period we evalua
te the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant arevision to the remaining
 periods of amortization. Recoverability of fini te lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset tothe future undiscounted cash 
flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carryin
g value and the fair value of the impaired asset. 
51

Table of ContentsAssumptions and estimates about 
future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety offactors, including exte
rnal factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Although we believe that 
the historical assumpt ions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates couldmaterially impact our reported fina
ncial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant judgment is r
equired in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions andcalculations where the u
ltimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these un certainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursementarrangements among re
lated entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and exp
enses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters couldbe different from th
at which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and ac cruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income taxprovision and net income in th
e period in which such determination is made.Our effective tax ra
te includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are plannedto be indefinitely re
invested outside the United States. Remittances o f foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, workingcapital and investmen
t needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal t
axes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the UnitedStates or tax legislation
 that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed for eign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States couldmaterially impact our income tax 
provision and effective tax rate.We record a valuation 
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred taxassets, we must be able to gene
rate sufficient taxable income in t hose jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecastedearnings, future taxabl
e income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prio r years, if carryback ispermitted under the l
aw and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine thatwe would not be able to realiz
e all or part of our net deferr ed tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be chargedto earnings in the period in whi
ch we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuatio n allowance related to anacquisition within the me
asurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reversethe applicable portion of 
the previously provided valua tion allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.We record deferred 
tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that r esult in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recogni
zed and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in 
the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. Beginning in fiscal 2017 (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual Report for additional inform ation regarding our fiscal 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation

), the impacts of the a ctual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these ju
risdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stockoption is exercised with any shor
tfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset establishe d recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxesin this period. S
uch detriment/benefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and prospective periods.We calculate our cu
rrent and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustm
ents based on filed 
52

Table of Contentsreturns are general
ly recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective taxrate.
The amount of income tax we pay 
is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcom
e for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingenciesassumed as a part of a business 
combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax r elated contingencies that are not a part of a businesscombination, we account for 
these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income
Taxes
 , which contains a two-step approa ch to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions t
aken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likelythan not that the tax posit
ion will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any r elated appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the taxbenefit as the larges
t amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved fo r ouruncertain tax positions, no assu
rance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due tochanging facts and circu
mstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial ruling s, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differfrom our estimates. To t
he extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impac t our provisionfor income taxes in the p
eriod in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes toreserves that are considered
 appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.In addition, as a part of our 
accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair v alues and goodwill is measured as the excess ofconsideration transferred o
ver the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible andwill result in an 
increased effective income tax rate i n the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assetsare generally not tax d
eductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deduc tible amortization expenses as apart of the accounting fo
r business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions,including those with 
nominal or zero percent tax  rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.Legal and Other Contingencies
We are currently invo
lved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential finan cialexposure. A description of our ac
counting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “BusinessCombinations” above. For legal and o
ther contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential lossfrom any claim or leg
al proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the det
ermination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals arebased only on the best informa
tion available at the time the accruals are made. As  additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liabilityrelated to our pending cl
aims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and 
financial position.Results of Operations
Impacts of Acquisitions
The 
comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was impacted by our recentacquisitions. In our discussion of 
changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 co mpared to fiscal 2015, we mayqualitatively disclos
e the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of ourbusinesses’ 
revenues where such qualita tive discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results ofoperations. When mater

separately identif iable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results ofoperations during the periods p
resented.We caution readers th
at, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, anyacquisition informat
ion that we provide has inherent limita tions for the following reasons: 
 
• any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force 
integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not beenintegrated, the rel
ative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and 
 
• although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software licenseupdates and product support contr
acts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts andhardware support contracts, 
the amounts shown as cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and product suppo rt deferredrevenues, and hardware support de
ferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarilyindicative of revenue 
improvements we will achieve upon contract r enewals to the extent customers do not renew.Presentation of Operating Segments and Other

Table of ContentsConstant Currency Presentation
Our international opera
tions have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As aresult, each businesses’ r
evenues and expenses and our total rev enues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against majorinternational curr
encies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of fore ign currency ratefluctuations, we compare 
the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To presentthis information, current a
nd comparative prior period results for enti ties reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constantexchange rates (i.e., th
e rates in effect on May 31, 2016, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rat es in effect during therespective periods. For exa
mple, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2017 and 2016, our financialstatements would refle
ct reported revenues of $1.11 million in f iscal 2017 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.12 million infiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month
-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the f iscal 2017 resultsusing the fiscal 2016 exchange 
rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percentchange based on actual, unrounded 
results in reported cur rency and in constant currency.Total Revenues and Operating Expenses

r services revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. The constant currency decrease in our hardwarerevenues during fiscal 2017 was 
primarily due to a redu ction in our hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our hardware support revenues.In constant currency, the Am
ericas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22% to th e growth in ourtotal revenues during fis
cal 2017.Excluding the effects of 
foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to highersales and marketing and r
esearch and development expenses, which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expenses; and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and I
aaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in ourcloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues. These cons
tant currency expense increases in fiscal 2017 we re partially offset by lower hardware expenses in fiscal 2017 dueto a decline in hardware p
roducts revenues and lower hardware support costs due primarily to lower headcount; lower software support costs in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower headco
unt; and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.In constant currency, our to
tal operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage ofrevenues was flat.
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:     
Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impac ted by movements ininternational curr
encies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points andtotal operating marg
in by 7 percentage points. Excluding the effects of un
favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and on- premise software business r
evenues and services business revenues due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2017 increases above. These constant currencyincreases in our revenues du
ring fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decr eases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, theEMEA region and the Asia Pacific r
egion contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas region was flat.Excluding the effects of 
favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and marketing and resear
ch and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting fromincreased headcount and in
frastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, highe r restructuring expenses that wererecorded pursuant to the Fisc
al 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in 
this Annual Report), and higher gene ral and administrative expenses due primarily to higher professional services fees, primarily legal related fees.These constant currency exp
ense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with ce rtain of our intangible assets that becamefully amortized during 
fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which decreased relative to fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairmentloss of $186 
million that was record ed in fiscal 2015.Excluding the effects of
 unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and total operating ma rgin as a percentage of revenues decreasedin fiscal 2016 as our total 
expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges

In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS subscriptions, software support and hardware support obligations assumed. Due to our app lication ofbusiness combination accounting rule
s, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired bu
sinesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers to which these contractual obligationspertain renew these contracts with 
us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full con tracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 
 
Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business comb ination accounting rulesgenerally require us to elimina
te these capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these deferred 
sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companiesoperated independently in the periods 
presented.

The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal2017, 2016 and 2015 were calculated based on the applicable jurisd
ictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 22.8%, 23.2% and 23.6%, respectively, instead of 18.9%, 22.2% and 22.6%, respectively, which 
represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations. The difference between our fiscal 2017 tax rate derivedfrom the table above 
and the tax rate derived from our consol idated statement of operations was primarily due to the net tax effects for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items,including the tax effects of amor
tization of intangible assets. The difference between our fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax rate s derived from the table above and the tax rates derived from our consolidatedstatements of operations were pr
imarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets.Cloud and On-Premise Software Business
Our cloud and on-premise softwar
e business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings and the licensing of oursoftware for on-premise 
and other IT environments with the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts. Our cloud SaaS, PaaS andIaaS offerings are gene
rally subscription based and generally recognized as revenues over the subscription period. New softwar e licenses revenues represent feesearned from granting cus
tomers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within on-premise and other 
IT environments and are gen erally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognitioncriteria are m
et. Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated through the sale of software suppo rt contracts related to on-premisenew software licenses purchas
ed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. We continue to placesignificant 
emphasis, both domestical ly and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirectchannels. Costs associated with our 
cloud and on-premise software business are included in cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses, software li cense updates andproduct support expenses, and sales 
and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloudSaaS, PaaS, IaaS and 
software support offerings, sa laries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and software offerings, and marketingprogram costs.

    Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total r evenues from our cloud and on-premise software businessincreased in fiscal 2017 du
e to growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues andrevenue 
contributions from our re cent acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite. These fiscal 2017 increases were partially offset by decreases in our newsoftware licenses revenu
es. The increases in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and decreases in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2017 wereprimarily due to the con
tinued strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue.The increase in 
our fiscal 2017 software li cense updates and product support revenues was a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase softwaresupport contracts in conjunc
tion with their new software licenses purchased, and due to the renewal of substantially all of th e software support customer baseeligible for renewal du
ring the fiscal 2017 and 2016 periods. During fiscal 2017, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currencyregional growth of 63%, 20% and 17%, 
respectively. In constant currency, tot
al cloud and on-premise software expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses resul ting fromincreased headcount, and high
er cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses thatwere incurred to support the 
related cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues increases. Th ese fiscal 2017 expense increases were partially offset by lower softwarelicense updates and product suppo
rt expenses in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower employee related expenses resulting from lower headcount.Excluding the effects of 
currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software business’ total margin increased due to the increase in revenues and totalmargin as a percentag

    Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency r ate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total revenues from our cloud andon-premise software business 
increased by 3 percentage points during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 due to similar reasons as noted above for the increase in fiscal 2017 revenues rel

Our hardware business revenues ar
e generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products for on-premise IT enviro
nments that are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardwarebusiness also earns revenues f
rom the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenuesratably over the contr
actual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-addedresellers and we also ma
rket and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include thecost of hardware products, which cons
ists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our int ernal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, wa
rranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess andobsolete; the 
cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses,which are largely personne
l related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardwar e offerings.

million in fiscal 2016, which d ecreased acquisition related and other expenses during this period.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 
2015:     Acquisition related and oth er expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a $186 million goodwill impairment lossrecorded during fiscal 2015.

    Interest expense incr eased in fiscal 2017 primarily du e to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $14.0billion of senior notes in July 2016. Th
is increase in interest expense during fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repaymen
t of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016. See Recent Financing Activities below and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our borrowings. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:     
Interest expense incr eased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0billion of senior notes in May 2015. 
We also issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014, which also contributed to additional interest expense during fiscal2016 
relative to fiscal 2015. These increases in interest expense during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by reductions in interest expense that primarily resultedfrom the maturity and 
repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016 and $1.5 billion of senior note s and the related fixed to variable interest rate swapagreements in July 2014.
Non-Operating Income,

     Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:     
On a constant currency basis, our non -operating income, net for fisca l 2017 increased primarily due to higher interestincome resulting from h
igher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and higher interest rates. In addition, we incurred higher other income, netduring fiscal 
2017 related to investmen t gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to net losses forsuch investments during fisc
al 2016. The aforementioned favorable movements in non-operating income, net during fisca l 2017 were partially offset by higherforeign currency losses, ne
t during fiscal 2017.Fiscal 2016 Compared to 
Fiscal 2015:     On a constant currency basis, our non -operating income, net in fiscal 2016 increased primarily due to higher interestincome resulting from h
igher interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investmen t balances and due to lower net foreign currency losses.Provision for Income 
Taxes:     Our effective tax ra te in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range ofincome tax rates. The prov
ision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal s tatutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earningsconsidered as indefinit
ely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production act
ivity deduction. In addition, beginning in fiscal 2017, the provision for income taxes also differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federalstatutory tax rate due to
 tax effects of stock-based compensation (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financia l Statements included elsewhere in this AnnualReport for additional discuss
ion). Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable chang
es in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, among others.

Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 20 16 primarily due to the favorable impact of excesstax benefits recogniz
ed in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based compensation, which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, incomparison to fiscal 2016 when such b
enefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion). To a lesser extent, the provision for in come taxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited froma favorable jurisdictional mix
 of earnings, as well as net favorable changes relating to unrecognized tax benefits from audit settlements, statute of limitationreleases, and 
other events. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:     
Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 decreased, relative to the provis ion for income taxes in fiscal 2015, due insubstantial part to lower n
et income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016, settlements with certain tax authorities, and the retroactive extension ofthe U.S. research 
and development tax cred it, which collectively were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during fiscal2016.

    The increase in working capi tal as of May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primar ily due to our issuance of $14.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2016, th
e favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2017 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorab
le working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0 billion of net cash used for our acquisitionof NetSuite in the second quart
er of fiscal 2017, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay d ividends to our stockholders and cash used forcapital expenditures.
Working capital as of May 31, 
2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was substanti ally flat as favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our netincome during fiscal 2016 and 
cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises were substantially offset by $10.4 billion of cash used for repu rchases of ourcommon stock in fiscal 2016, $2.5 bi
llion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders in fiscal 2016, and $1.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures infiscal 2016.
Our working capital may be imp
acted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: 
    Cash and cash equivalents prim arily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper andother securities with ori
ginal maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities andcertain other securities. The 
increase in cash, cash equ ivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to cashinflows generated by our opera
tions during fiscal 2017, $13.6 billion of cash inflows, net of repayments, from fiscal 2017 debt issuan ces, and cash inflows fromstock option exercises. These 
fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition ofNetSuite, repurchases of 
our common stock, payments of c ash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. Cash, cash equivalents andmarketable securi
ties included $54.4 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2017. We consider $47.5 billion

Table of Contentsof our undistributed earnings 
as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S.income tax if repatriated to 
the United States. Assuming a full u tilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with theseundistributed earnings would be app
roximately $15.1 billion as of May 31, 2017 should the amounts be repatriated to the Uni ted States. The amount of cash, cashequivalents and market
able securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances heldby our foreign 
subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reportingperiod (the offset to which 
is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance she ets and is also presented as a line itemin our consolidated state
ments of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certainmajor international 
currencies during fisc al 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for thesesubsidiaries decreased on 
a net basis as of May 31, 2017 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rat es from our May 31, 2016 balancesheet date.
The increase in cash, cash 
equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was prim arily due to cash inflows generated byour operations during fisca
l 2016, $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. These fis
cal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows, primarily $10.4 billion for repurchases of our commonstock, payments of cash dividends 
to our stockholders, and cash used for capital expenditu res. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketablesecurities balances 
as of May 31, 2016 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31, 2015 as the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies d
uring fiscal 2016.Days sales outstanding, which we calcu
late by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 44 days at May 31, 2017compared with 46 days at May 31, 2016. The days s

Table of ContentsRecent Financing Activities:
Cash Dividends 
:    In fiscal 2017, we declar ed and paid cash dividends of $0.64 per share that totaled $2.6 billion. In June 2017, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.19 p
er share of our outstanding common stock payable on August 2, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business onJuly 19, 2017. Future declarations of d
ividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.
Revolving Credit 
Agreements :    In May 2017, we entered into four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender andadministrative agen
t (the 2017 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2017 Cred it Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capi
tal and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formulaor (2) a 
base rate formula, e ach as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 29, 2017, which is the termination date ofthe 2017 Credit Agreements. Addition
al details regarding the 2017 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidat ed Financial Statementsincluded elsewhere in this Annua
l Report.In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8 
billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent(the 2016 Credit Agreements). 
In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms. Senior Notes 
:    In July 2016, we issued $14.0 billion of senio r notes comprised of the following: 
 
•  $4.25 billion of 1.90% senior notes due September 2021; 
 
•  $2.5 billion of 2.40% senior notes due September 2023; 
 
•  $3.0 billion of 2.65% senior notes due July 2026; 
 
•  $1.25 billion of 3.85% senior notes due July 2036; and 
 
•  $3.0 billion of 4.00% senior notes due July 2046.We issued the senior notes fo
r general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment ofindebtedness and future acqu
isitions. Additional details regarding the s enior notes are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in this Annual Report.
Other Fiscal 2017 Borrowings Activities 
:    In connection with our acquis ition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed $310 million par valueof legacy 
NetSuite convertible notes (NetSuite Debt), which had a fair value of $342 million as of the acquisition date. In December 2016, we repurchased andsettled for cash substant
ially all of the NetSuite Debt (refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial State ments included in this Annual Report for additionaldiscussion).
In the second quarter of f
iscal 2017, we assumed $113 million of debt due August 1, 2025 in conne ction with the acquisition of certain land and buildings.Common Stock 
Repurchases :    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2017,approximately $5.3 billion 
remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 85.6 million shares for $3.5 billion,271.9 million shares for $10.4 bil
lion, and 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration dat
e and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitionsand dividend payments, our debt r
epayment obligations (described further below) or repurchases of our debt, our s tock price, and economic and market conditions.Our stock repurchases may be e
ffected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may beaccelerated, suspended, d
elayed or discontinued at any time.Contractual Obligations:

Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2017 after considering:  
 
• certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectivelybecame variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interes

ieve it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2018. We are involved in claimsand legal proceedings. All such

Selected Quarterly Financial 
Data Quarterly revenues, expenses 
and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales for ce incentivecompensation plans. In addit
ion, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity inEurope during the summer. These s
easonal factors are common in the technology indust ry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarterrevenues as compared to r
evenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the ope
rating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud and on-premisesoftware business and hardware busin
ess) as certain expenses within our cost str ucture are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue infiscal 2018.
The following tables set 
forth selected unaudit ed quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consistedonly of normal recurring 
adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with theconsolidated financia

Our stock-based compensation prog
ram is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees andalign their interes
ts with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that r
estricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock -based awardsgranted while providing compe
titive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2014 has been aweighted-average annual
ized rate of 1.2% per year. The potentia l dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards orstock options granted and assumed, n
et of restricted stock-based

Table of Contentsawards and stock options forfei
ted by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. Thismaximum potential di
lution will only result if all rest ricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31,2017, which generally have a ten
-year exercise period, less than 1% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recentyears, our stock repurchase p
rogram has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we have recently reduced thelevel of our stock repurch
ases and we may further reduce repurchases in th e future in order to use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay orrepurchase indebtedness or 
for other purposes. At May 31, 2017, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, reg
ardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higherthan the market pric
e as of such date, was 9.5%.During fiscal 2017, the Compensation Com
mittee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the organization-wide stock-based award grants to selectedemployees, all stock-bas
ed award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. Aseparate Plan Committe

tem 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk
Our bank deposits and time deposits 
are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that mee
t investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2017, substantiallyall of our marketable securities
 are high quality with approximately 32% having m aturity dates within one year and 68% having maturity dates within one to fiveyears (a description of ou
r marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capit
al Resources” above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debtsecurities are impacted by intere
st rate movements and if interest rat es would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2017, we estimate the changewould have decreased the fa
ir values of our marketable securities holdings by $348 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio as
sociated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generallydo not use our investments for t
rading purposes.Changes in the o
verall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2017, total interest inco
me was $802 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.47% on a worldwide basis. Thetable below presents the app
roximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents  and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for ourinvestment portfolio a

Interest Expense Risk
Interest Expense Risk 
— Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOur total borrowings were $57.9 billion 
as of May 31, 2017, consisting of $51.9 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of 
other borrowings, primarily und er revolving credit agreements.We have entered into certain i
nterest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billionof 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (J
anuary 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5billion of 2.80% senior notes due Ju
ly 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. Thecritical terms of the interest rate s
wap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, and July 2021 Notes th at the interest rateswap agreements pertain 
to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowingsfor 
trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives
and
Hedging
 (ASC 815). The total fair value g
ain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2017 was $40 million. If LIBOR-based inte rest rates would havebeen higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2017, 
the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $153 million.Additional 
details regarding our sen ior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual Report.

Table of ContentsBy issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by en
tering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associat ed with variableinterest rates based upon L
IBOR. As of May 31, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes and January 2019 Notes, October2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes 
after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 1.68%. Changes in the overall level ofinterest rates af
fect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk s ensitivity analysis is used to measureinterest rate risk by 
computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2017, if LIBOR-basedinterest rates 
would have been higher by 100 basis points, th e change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $73 million as it relatesto our fixed to variable 
interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings.Currency Risk
Foreign Currency 
Transaction Risk — Foreign Currency Forward ContractsWe transact business in va
rious foreign currencies and have established a program that  primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated with the eff
ects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreas
es in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolatility associat
ed with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany sublicense 
fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term induration.
Neither do we use these foreign 
currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair va
lues of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues recorded to our consol
idated statement of operations. Given the short dura tion of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. Thebalance sheet classi
fication for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unreal ized gainposition and other current 
liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values ofthese forward contracts 
is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.We expect that we will con
tinue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of ga ins or losses from our foreign currency forwardcontracts. Our ultimat
e realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactionsthat we 
enter into, the curren cy exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currencyforward contracts and othe
r factors. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we he ld to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange forother major interna
tional currencies were $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of forward contracts weheld to sell 
U.S. Dollars in exchange for other m ajor international currencies were $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstandingforeign currency forward 
contracts were nominal at May 31, 2017 and 2016. Net foreign exchange transaction loss es included in non-operating income, net in theaccompanying consolidated s
tatements of operations were $152 million, $110 million and $157 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a largeportion of our 
consolidated operations a re international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of whichare unknown.
Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Fluctuations in foreign cur
rencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amountsinto U.S. Dollars. In particular, 
the amount of cash, cash equival ents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cashheld by these subsidiaries is sub
ject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of 
73

Table of Contentsthe end of each respect
ive reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balancesheets and is also presented 
as a line item in our consolid ated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated 
against certain international curre ncies as of the end of fiscal 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat we reported in U.S. Dollars for 
foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2017 decreased relativ e to what we would have reportedusing a constant currency r
ate from May 31, 2016. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on ourreported cash and cash 
equivalents balances in U.S. Dolla rs for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were decreases of $86 million, $115 million and $1.2 billion,respectively. The following 
table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated  in certain majorforeign currencies th

   If overall foreign cu

ties we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $518 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cashequivalents and marketable 
securities balances.Foreign Currency Translation Risk 
— Net Investment HedgeIn July 2013, we issued €750 million of 3.125% sen
ior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certa
in of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity causedby the changes in foreign cur
rency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to th e U.S. Dollar. As a result, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge,the change in the carry
ing value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumula
ted other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income in
cluded elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $1 million of ne t other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2017. Any remaining change inthe carrying value of th
e July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income, net. We did not record any ineffect
iveness during fiscal 2017.Fluctuations in the exchange 
rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes atmaturity. If the U.S. Dollar would hav
e been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2017, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have 
increased by approximately $83 million.Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period cover
ed by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of ourDisclosure Committee and our 
management, including our Principal Execu tive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of thedesign and operation of our disc
losure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls are pro cedures thatare designed to ensure tha
t information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Disclosure controls are a
lso designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Princ
ipal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation ofdisclosure controls includ
es an evaluation of some components of our internal control ove r financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation ofinternal control over 
financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below.The evaluation of our disclosu
re controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generat
ed for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the course of the contro ls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identifiedand sought to confirm 
that appropriate cor rective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on aquarterly basis so that th
e conclusions of management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Off icer), concerning theeffectiveness of the d
isclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controlsare also evaluated on an ongo
ing basis by both our internal audit and finance organizations. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitorour disclosure controls and to 
modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust ascircumstances merit.
Based on our management’s eva
luation (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end ofthe period covered by this r
eport, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under th
e supervision and with the parti cipation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is ourPrincipal Financial Officer)
, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 based on the guidelines established in 
Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013framework. Our internal con
trol over financial reporting includes  policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Based on the results of our evalu
ation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2017. We reviewed the results of managem
ent’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.The effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as sta
ted in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.

Table of ContentsChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15
 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control overfinancial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Pr
incipal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and proceduresand internal control ove
r financial reporting are designed t o provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurancelevel. However, our managemen
t does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errorsand all fraud. A control syste
m, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controlsystem are met. Further, 
the design of a control system mu st reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be consideredrelative to their 
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues andinstances of fraud, if any, h
ave been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdownscan occur because of a si
mple error or mistake. Additionally, con trols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management ove
rride of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likel ihood offuture events and there 
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls maybecome inadequate bec
ause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitationsin a cost-effective control s
ystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B.     Other Information

The Board of Directors and Stockholde
rs of Oracle CorporationWe have audited Oracle Corpo
ration’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—IntegratedFramework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organiza tions of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation’smanagement is responsible
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial reporting 
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinionon the company’s internal 
control over financial repor ting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those s tandards require that we planand perform the audit to
 obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Ouraudit included 
obtaining an understanding of in ternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating thedesign and operating effe
ctiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we consid ered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those pol
icies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit pr eparation of financialstatements in accord
ance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of manag
ement and directors of the company; and (3) provid e reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, Oracle Corporation 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated b alance sheets ofOracle Corporation as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, 
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each ofthe three years in the p
eriod ended May 31, 2017 of Oracle Corporation and our report dated June 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOracle Corporation develops, m
anufactures, markets, sells, hosts and supports applications, platform and infrastructure technologies for information technology(IT) environments includ
ing applications software, database and midd leware software, hardware—including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storageand industry-specific ha
rdware products—and related services that are engineered to work together in cloud-based and on-premise IT environmen ts. We offer ourcustomers the option to deploy ou
r comprehensive set of cloud offerings including Oracle Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) andInfrastructure as a Service (Iaa
S) or to purchase our software and hardware produc ts and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise ITenvironments. Customers that pu
rchase our software products may elect to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspec
ified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance.Customers that purchase our ha
rdware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, whi ch provide customers with software updates and can includeproduct repairs, maint
enance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improvecustomer utilization of their i
nvestments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.Oracle Corporation conducts 
business globally and was incorpora ted in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June1977.
Basis of Financial Statements
The 
consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions ofcertain of our consolida
ted entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attri butable to Oracle’s stockholders for all periodspresented. The noncontrolling 
interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been includedas a component of non-operat
ing income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certainother prior year balances 
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclass ifications did not affect total revenues, operating income ornet income.
Included in acquisition r
elated and other expenses as presented in our conso lidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition relatedbenefit of $19 million and 
a litigation related benefit of $53 million, respectively. Further, acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 inc luded $186million related to 
a goodwill impairment loss.In fiscal 2017, we adopted Accounting St

Accounting
(ASU 2016-09). As required by ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are reflected in the consolidated statemen
ts of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis. As required by ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefitsrecognized on stock-based co
mpensation expense are classified as an operating activity in ou r consolidated statements of cash flows and we have applied thisprovision on a retrospectiv
e basis. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $124 million and $244 million, respectively, with a corresponding offset to n
et cash used for financing activities. Finally, ASU 2016-09 allows for the option to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather thanestimating expected 
forfeitures over the course of a vesting period. We have elected to  account for forfeitures as they occur and the net cumulative effect of thischange was recognized as a $9 m
illion increase to additional paid in capital, a $3 million increase to deferred tax assets and a $6 million reduction to retained earnings as of June 1, 2016.
In addition, in fiscal 2017, we a
lso adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates, none of which had a mater ial impact to our reported financial position orresults of operations and c

. Use of Estimates
Our consolidated 
financial statem ents are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the FinancialAccounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codi
fication (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulle tins and other applicableguidance issued by the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions.We believe that the 
estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are r easonable based upon information available to us at the time that theseestimates, judgments and 
assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial sta
tements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences betweenthese estimates, judgm
ents or assumptions and actual results, our consoli dated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of aparticular transa
ction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting amo
ng available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of 
revenues include:  
 
• cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, which generally grant customers access to abroad range of our applica
tions, platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure,standards-based cloud comput
ing environment; new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database,middleware, applicat
ions and industry-specific software products; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); 
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of: hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, and storage products, andindustry-specific hardwa
re; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud, software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support andeducation services.
Revenues generally are r
ecognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related 
Services (Non-software Elements) Our revenue recognition poli
cy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, h ardware support and relatedservices is based upon the ac
counting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue
Recognition
 , Multiple-Element
Arrangements,
and we exercise judgment and use estimates in 
connection with the deter mination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, hardware support andrelated services r
evenues to be recognized in each accounting period.

Revenues from the sales of our non
-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exis ts; (2) we deliver the products andpassage of the title to 
the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at thetime of 
sale because the forego ing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS 
offerings generally prov ide customers access to certain of our software and/or infrastructure within a cloud-based IT environmentthat we manage, host and support and o
ffer to customers on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include deployment and managemen t services forsoftware and hardware and re
lated IT infrastructure. Revenues for our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract termcommencing with the date 
the service is made available to customers and  all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.Revenues from the sale of ha
rdware products represent amounts earned primar ily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, andindustry-specific hardwa
re and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Our hardware support offerings gen
erally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of ourhardware products and can also 
include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as apercentage of the net h
ardware products fees. Hardware support contra cts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractualterm of the arrange
ments, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements)
We enter into arrangements 
with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of oneanother (referred to as no
n-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as aseparate unit 
of accounting provided the fo llowing criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for anarrangement that in
cludes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or pe rformance of the undelivered product or service isconsidered probable and is subst
antially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us oranother 
vendor or could be resold by the cus tomer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the deliveredproducts. Where the aforeme
ntioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combin ed with the undelivered element(s) and treatedas a single unit of account
ing for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that includemore than one 
deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in thecase of our cloud offerings, we g
enerally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purpos es of revenue classificationof the elements that 
are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements ofoperations based 
on a rational and consisten t methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.For our non-software 
multiple-element arrangements, we  allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. Theselling price for ea
ch element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, orestimated selling pr
ice (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangiblehardware product includes sof
tware, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essentialfunctionality and, if so, the
 
88

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2017
 
entire product is treated as
 a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables us
ing the relative selling prices of each  unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognizedfor delivered elem
ents to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specifi ed performanceconditions.
When possible, we establish VSOE of selling p
rice for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arra ngements using the price charged for adeliverable when sold separ
ately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPEis established 
by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we areunable to determine th
e selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewinghistorical transac
tions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factorsincluding, but not limited 
to, pricing practices in cluding discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offerour products and services, the 
type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among othe rs) and the stage of theproduct lifecycle. The d
etermination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model andgo-to-market strat
egy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which couldresult in changes to our det
ermination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could  differmaterially from ou
r results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in ourselling prices.
Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Servic
es (Software Elements)New software licenses revenues p
rimarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, applications and industry- specific software produc
ts and exclude cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in softwarelicense updates and product suppo
rt revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recogn ition is substantially governed by the accounting guidancecontained in ASC 985-605, 
Software
 — Revenue
Recognition.
We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount ofsoftware and software rel
ated services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.For software license arr
angements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licensesrevenues when: (1) we enter in
to a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale pr ice is fixed ordeterminable and free of conti
ngencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not 
met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.Substantially all of our sof
tware license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (forexample, in agreemen
ts with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that arereferenced in the current agreement
 and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctoryand all other revenue r
ecognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for examp le, acceptance provisions that are long-term innature or are not include
d as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration ofthe acceptance 
period. The vast majority of our sof
tware license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related f
ees are recognized ratably over the

term of the arrange
ment, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releasesand patches released dur
ing the term of the support period. Produ ct support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access totechnical support personne
l. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net n ew software licenses fees andare generally invoic
ed in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product supportcontracts annually.
Revenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Software Products, Software Support and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)We often enter into a
rrangements with customers that purchase both software related products, software support and software related services from us at the s ametime, or within close 
proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-elementarrangements include 
the sale of our software products, software license updates and product suppo rt contracts and other software related services wherebysoftware license deliv
ery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-elementarrangements, we have appl
ied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Underthe residual method, if fair
 value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value  of the undelivered elements is deferred with theremaining portion of the
 arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of asoftware 
related multiple -element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE—described furtherabove), with any remaining a
mount allocated to the software license.Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable 
to both Software and Non-software ElementsRevenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Non-software ElementsWe also enter into multiple-element
 arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and servicesofferings including new softwar
e licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardwaresupport, consulting, advanced custo
mer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling pr
ices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the softwaregroup to the respective e
lements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate theconsideration within the non-so
ftware group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception as described above. After the 
arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements, we account foreach respective el
ement in the arrangement as described above and below.Other Revenue Recognition Policies Appl
icable to Software and Non-software ElementsMany of our software arrange
ments include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting rev
enues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because thearrangements qualify 
as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should beaccounted for separat
ely include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degreeof 
risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance 
90

criteria on the realizability of the
 software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there issignificant uncerta
inty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficientlyresolved. We estimate the pr
oportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as apercentage of total 
estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognizedwhen we receive final ac
ceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimatedlosses immediately using 
cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization de livering the services.The complexity of the est
imation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportionalperformance method of 
accounting affects the amounts of revenues and rel ated expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internaland external factors can affect 
our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our advanced customer support se
rvices are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-softwa reproducts and services. We of
fer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higheravailability of the
ir products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arr angement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services areperformed or ratably ov
er the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.Education revenues are a
lso a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud, software and hardware products. Education r
evenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.If an arrangement 
contains multiple el ements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licensesrevenues and/or hardware produ
cts revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contractaccounting using either
 the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.We 
also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions arerequired by law, to determ
ine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple fa ctors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions,the “essential use” of 
the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution
 of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described abovehave been met. If such
 a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision bythe governmental entity.
We assess whether fees ar
e fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standardpayment terms are ne
t 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard pay mentterms based on whether we have suc
cessful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics)and, if so, generally conclud
e such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereb y satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.While most of our arrang
ements for sales within our businesses include short-te rm payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing tocreditworthy customers pr
imarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concess
ions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenuerecognition criter
ia have been met, we recognize new software licenses

revenues and hardware products 
revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally soldreceivables financ
ed through our financing division on a non-re course basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of executionand we classify the proceeds 
from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. W e account for the sales of thesereceivables as “tru
e sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers
and
Servicing
 , as we are considered to have su rrendered control of these financing receivables. Wesold $1.6 
billion of our financing r eceivables to financial institutions during fiscal 2017 and $1.8 billion during each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.Our customers include sever
al of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the sametime that we have sold our produ
cts to these same companies (Concu rrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services thatoccur within a three-mon
th time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosu
re. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms weconsider to be at arm’s 
length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are metand the goods and services acqui
red are necessary for our current operations.Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, 
Business
Combinations
 , in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired and the liabi
lities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquis
ition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent conside ration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertainand subject to refinem
ent. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabili
ties assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values ofassets acquired or liab
ilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reco rded to our consolidated statements of operations.Costs to exit or restructur
e certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operat ions are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420,Exit
or
Disposal
Cost
Obligations
, and are accounted for sep arately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measur
ed at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fairvalue of facility restructuring
 activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actualresults. This may require us 
to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.
For a given acquisition, we may id
entify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evalua tion of these pre-acquisition contingenci
es throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part ofthe fair value esti
mates of assets acquired and liabilities ass umed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If we cannot reasonabl
y determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition conting ency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which isgenerally the case giv
en the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liabili
ty had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to themeasurement period, ch
anges in our estimates of such contingencies will aff ect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financialposition.

In addition, uncertain t
ax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination  are initially estimated as of theacquisition date. We r
eevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourpreliminary estim
ates being recorded to goodwill if identified wi thin the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination ofthe tax allowance’s or con
tingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related v aluation allowances willaffect our provision for 
income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
In accordance with ASC 320, 
Investments
 — Debt
and
Equity
Securities,
and based on our intentions rega rding these instruments, we classify substantially all ofour marketable debt and e
quity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, withall unrealized gains (losse
s) reflected net of tax in stockholders’ equity on our conso lidated balance sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income. I
f we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-opera tingincome, net in the accompa
nying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required.Substantially all of our m
arketable debt and equity investments are class ified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use incurrent operations.
We 
hold investments in certain non-marketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities arerecorded at cost and inc
luded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the ter ms of our ownership of these non-marketablesecurities, we determ
ine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323,Investments

including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments. The additional disclosures 
regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We 
record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,provisions are provided at di
ffering rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history assoc iated with the geographic region that the receivable wasrecorded in and current ec

 are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivativesand trade receivabl
es. Our cash and cash equivalents are gen erally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to anysingle financial institution
. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investm ent-grade securities. Ourderivative contrac

largely mitigated with collateral 
security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates fromcontractually established 
thresholds. We generally do no t require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated bycredit evaluations we pe
rform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our custome r contracts and by thediversification of our 
customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.We outsource the design, manu
facturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outsidethe United States. Further, we have 
simplified our supply chain p rocesses by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number oflocations where these thi
rd-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver th e contractedservices for our hardware p
roducts could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business.Inventories
Inventories are stated at 
the lower of cost or net re alizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis.We evaluate our ending inv
entories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections offuture demand within speci
fic time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardwareexpenses. In addition, we 
assess the impact of chang ing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point ofloss recognition, a new, lower-cos
t basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not resu lt in the restoration orincrease in that newly es
tablished cost basis.Other Receivables
Other receivables rep
resent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses 
and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $794 million and $816 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We defer sales comm
ission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recogn ize the related expenses over the non-cancelable term ofthe related contra
cts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated st
atements of operations.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment 
are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated us
eful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimateduseful lives of the improv
ements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances i
ndicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment chargesin fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered 
to have an indefinite useful life are 
94

Table of ContentsORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2017
 
amortized over thei
r useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangibleassets and whether events or 
changes in circumstanc es warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.The carrying amounts of our goodwil
l and intangible assets are periodically revie wed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets) and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Pursuant to ASC 350, Intangibles —Goodwill
and
Other
, we can opt to perform a qual itative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-stepimpairment test. Based on ou
r qualitative assessment, if we determ ine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50percent) to be less than 
its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each  reporting unit to itscarrying value. If the 
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and weare not required to perform 
further testing. If th e carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then wemust perform the second
 step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reportingunit’s goodwill exceeds its i
mplied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We did not recognize any goodwill impairmentcharges in fiscal 
2017 or 2016. During fiscal 2015, we recogniz ed a $186 million goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware business.Recoverability of 
finite lived intangib le assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset isexpected to generate. Rec
overability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of th e asset to its fair value. If the assetis considered to be im
paired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Wedid not recognize any 
intangible asset impa irment charges in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.Derivative Financial Instruments
During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we used deriva
tive and non-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 11 below for additional infor
mation). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives
and
Hedging
 (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recor
ded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires thatchanges in our derivatives
’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).
The accounting for changes in 
the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resu lting designation. For a derivative instrumentdesignated as a fair va
lue hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding offsetrecorded to the 
item for which the risk is b eing hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change infair value on the effective p
ortion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance she ets, and an amount is reclassified out ofaccumulated other co
mprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the non-derivative financialinstrument designated 
as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of theeffective portion for each rep
orting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance she ets.We perform the eff
ectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions of  the derivatives, if any,are recognized imm
ediately in earnings.

Legal Contingencies
We are currently invo
lved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure. A description of our ac
counting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “BusinessCombinations” above. For legal and o
ther contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the po
tential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below providesadditional information regardi
ng certain of our legal contingencies. Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs for hardwa
re products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented.Foreign Currency
We transact business in va
rious foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently,revenues and expenses of opera
tions outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United St
ates are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translationadjustments are includ
ed in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other co mprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets andrelated periodic movements are 
summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction lossesincluded in non-operating in
come, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $152 million, $110 million and $157 million in fiscal 2017,2016 and 2015, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for share-b
ased payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs),service-based employe
e stock options, and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation
 — Stock
Compensation,which requires that share
-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fairvalues. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017 (se
e Note 1 above), we account for forfeitu res as they occur. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-basedcompensation expense on a str
aight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, which is generally twelve months, as the performanceconditions to evaluate attai
nment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. The amount of stock-based compensation expense r
ecorded as of the end of each annual reporting period is based on the actual att ainment of performance targets. During our interimreporting periods, stock-bas
ed compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expectedattainment of 
performance targe ts are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basisduring each interim r
eporting period in which such estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation exp ense that we record for eachinterim reporting pe
riod to vary. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period ofthe award, which is generally 
four years. We record deferred 
tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock- based compensation recogni
zed and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at thestatutory tax rates in 
the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deduct ions. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017, the impacts of the actual taxdeductions for stock-
based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are

Income Taxes
We account for income 
taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income
Taxes
 . Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporarydifferences between th
e tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuationallowance to reduce our de
ferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is applied pursu
ant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to dete
rmine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, includingresolution of any relat
ed appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to berealized upon ultimate settlement.
 We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.

licies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a par t of a business combination is providedunder “Business Combinations” above.

ively Topic606). Topic 606 supersedes nearly a
ll existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle o f Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promisedgoods or services are trans
ferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step pro
cess to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenuerecognition process than a
re required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in  the contract, estimating the amount of variableconsideration to include 
in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also providesguidance 
on the recognition of costs r elated to obtaining customer contracts. Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our firstquarter of fiscal 2019 using 
either of two methods: (1) retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior repor ting period presented with the option to electcertain practic
al expedients as defined within Topic 606 or (2) retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606recognized at the dat
e of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The accounting for the recognition of costsrelated to obtaining cus
tomer contracts under Topic 606 is significantly different than our cur rent capitalization policy. The adoption of Topic 606 will result inadditional types of costs th
at will be capitalized. Additionally, all amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than our current policy. Preliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the fi
rst quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method (1) and we do not believe there will be a materialimpact to our revenues upon adop
tion. We are continuing to evaluate the impac t to our revenues related to our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminaryassessments are subject

2016, pursuant to the terms of th
e tender offer and applicable Delaware law, we accepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding NetSuite Shares andeffectuated the merger of 
NetSuite with and into a wholly-owned subsidi ary of Oracle and NetSuite became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle.Pursuant to the Merger Agreem
ent, NetSuite Shares that remained outstanding and were not acquired by us were converted into, and cancelled in ex change for, theright to receive $109.00 per sh
are in cash. The unvested equity awards to acquire NetSuite Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of themerger were converted 
into equity awards denominated in shares of Ora cle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquiredNetSuite to, among other things, exp
and our cloud software as a service offerings with a complementary set of cloud ERP and related cloud software applications for customers. We have in
cluded the financial results of NetSuite in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s Cha
irman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer and Oracle’s largest stockholder, is an affiliate of NetSuite’s largeststockholder, NetSuite Restric
ted Holdings LLC (a single member LLC invest ment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled byMr. Ellison), which owned approximat
ely 40% of the issued and outstanding NetSuite Shares immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger. Oracle’s Boa rd ofDirectors appointed a Speci
al Committee (comprised solely of directors who are independent of the management of Oracle, Mr. Ellison, his family members andany affiliated ent
ities, and NetSuite) to which it delegated the full and exclusive power, authority and discretion of the Board to evaluate, assess, and approve theNetSuite transaction on its b
ehalf. The Special Committee engaged its own independent legal counsel and its own independent financial advisor to advise it on the transaction. The financ
ial advisor provided the Special Committee with a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. After extensive deliberations, theSpecial Committee conc
luded that the transaction terms were fair to Oracle and the transaction was in the best interests of Oracle and its stockholders. The SpecialCommittee unanimously approv
ed the transaction on behalf of Oracle and the Board.The total prelimina
ry purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fairvalues of restricted s
tock-based awards and stock options assumed. Pursuant to our bus iness combinations accounting policy, we estimated the preliminary fairvalues of net tangible and 
intangible assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values was recorded asgoodwill. The preliminary f
air values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptionsare subject to change with
in the measurement period (up to one year from the acq uisition date). The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair valuesof intangible assets acqu

l statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted ofapproximately $3.0 billion 
in cash and $12 million for the fair values of restricted s tock-based awards and stock options assumed. We preliminarily recorded $153million of net tangibl
e assets and $1.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.8 billion of residual goodwill. The preliminary fair value estimate
s for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2017 were based upon preliminary calculations and valua

Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions
During fiscal 2016, we acquired c

Acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc.
On September 8, 2014, we completed our 
acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider o f integrated software, hardware and services solutions tothe hospitality and ret

ries, facilities, and retailers. We have included the financ ial results of MICROS in our consolidated financial statements from thedate of acquisition.
The total purchase price 
for MICROS was $5.2 billion which consisted of $5.2 bill ion in cash paid to acquire the outstanding common stock of MICROS and $6million for the fai

f goodwill, $2.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets and $25 million of net tangible liabilities.Other Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions
During fiscal 2015, we acquired c
ertain other companies and purchased ce rtain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and servicesofferings. These acquisit
ions were not individually significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective ac
quisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually material to our consolidated financialstatements. In the aggr
egate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximat ely $1.7 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.7 billion in cashand $7 million

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIESCash and cash equivalents prim
arily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days orless. Marketable secur
ities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt sec urities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.The amortized princip
al amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and mark etable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2017 and 2016. We use thespecific identification method t
o determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized gains and losses were insignifi
cant for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketablesecurities held, substant

%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 68% and 72%, respectively, matur
e within one to five years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limitpurchases of marketabl
e debt securities to investment-grade secu rities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any oneissuer. As stated in our investm
ent policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and marke t risk.Restricted cash that was in
cluded within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016 and our consolidated statem

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We perform fair 
value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in an or
derly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value meas urements for assets andliabilities requi
red to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptionsthat market parti
cipants would use when pricing the assets or l iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC 820 establishes a 
fair value hierar chy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring fair value. A
n asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of inpu t that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establ
ishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
103

Table of ContentsORACLE CORPORATION

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2017
 
 
•  Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 
• Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical
 or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated byobservable market dat
a for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or  
 
•  Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our assets and liabiliti

were 1.81% and 1.28% for the January 2019 Notes, 1.64% and 1.11% for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.79% and 1.26% for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to Notes 1 and 11 for a description of our accounting fo
r fair value hedges. 
 
In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, 
the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016, respect
ively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denomina ted debt,including annual interest payments and 
the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11 for additional information).
 
 
We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the vo latility instockholders’ equity caused by the changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar (see Note 11 for additional information). 
 
In July 2016, we issued $14.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interes
t is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certa
in instances.Future principal payments 
(adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agree ments associated with the January 2021 Notes) for all of our borrowings atMay 31, 2017 were as follows (in mill

e premium in certain instances except for the floating-rate senior notes which may not be redeemed prior to their maturity. The senior notes rank pari passu wi
th any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see addi tional discussion regarding ourcommercial paper p
rogram below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of thesubsidiaries of Oracle Corpor
ation are or will be effective ly senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliancewith all debt-relat
ed covenants at May 31, 2017.Revolving Credit Agreements
In May 2017, we entered into four r
evolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2017 CreditAgreements) and borrowed $3.8 bill
ion pursuant to these agreements. The 2017 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital andother general corpora
te purposes. Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as setforth in the 2017 Credit Agreem
ents. The borrowings are due and payable on June 29, 2017, which is the terminat ion date of the 2017 Credit Agreements.

In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to 
three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and adm inistrative agent(the 2016 Credit Agreements). 
In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms.In April 2013, we entered into a $3.0 bi
llion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan ChaseBank, N.A. and certain other lenders 
(the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credi t Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be usedfor general corporat
e purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2013 Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and 
re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interestunder the 2013 Credit Agreement 
is based on either (a) a LIBOR-based formula or (b) the Base Ra te formula, each as set forth in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Anyamounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credi
t Agreement are due on April 20, 2018. No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2017 and 2016.
The 2013 Credit Agreement conta
ins certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. If any o f the events of default occur andare not cured within appli
cable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts owed under the agreement to which the default relates may be declared immediatelydue and payable and the 
relevant agreemen t may be terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 Credit Agreement covenants as of May 31, 2017.Commercial 
Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes In April 2013, pursuant to our existing $3.0 b
illion commercial paper program which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short -term promissory notes pursuant toa private placement exemption fr
om the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws, we entered into new dealer agreements with various banksand a new Issuing and 
Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (JP Morgan). Ef fective on December 22, 2014, Deutsche Bank TrustCompanies Americas becam
e the Successor Issuing and Paying Agent replacing JP Morgan. Since that time, we have entered into new dealer agreements withadditional banks. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not hav
e any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes thatwe may issue in the future with 
the 2013 Credit Agreement. Other Borrowings Activities
In connection with our acquisi
tion of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (see Note 2 above), we assumed $310 million par value of legacy NetSuiteconvertible notes (NetSuit
e Debt), which had a fair value of $342 mi llion as of the acquisition date. Our acquisition of NetSuite triggered (a) the right of holders ofthe NetSuite Debt to convert th
eir debt holdings into an amount payable in cash, at any time through December 22, 2016, based upon conversion fo rmulas that arecontained within the NetSuite Deb
t indenture and (b) the obligation of NetSuite to offer to repurchase the NetSuite Debt from each holder at a purchase price equalto par, plus 
accrued and unpaid inter est, which offer expired on December 21, 2016. In December 2016, we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of theNetSuite Debt.
In the second quarter of f
iscal 2017, we assumed $113 million of debt that bears interest at 3.53% and matures in August 2025 in connection with our acquisition ofcertain land and buildings.

In connection with our acquisi
tions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support, andhardware support obligations, a
mong others, assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumedusing a cost build-up approach. The 
cost build-up approach determ ines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profitmargin. The sum of the costs and op
erating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acqu iredobligations. These aforem
entioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, softwarelicense updates and product suppo
rt and hardware deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resultingrevenues that we recogniz
ed or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair 
Value Hedges — Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn July 2014, we entered into cer
tain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying  the fixed-interest obligations associated with ourOctober 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that th
e interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, weentered into 
certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notesso that the interest pay
able on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate s wap agreements match thecritical terms o
f the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notionalamounts and maturity dat
es.We have designated the a
forementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are cha
racterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values ofcertain of our fixed-
rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The  changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized asinterest expense in our conso
lidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance she
ets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements ofoperations with the correspond
ing amount included in notes payable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for theOctober 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Not
es are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities.
We do not use any interest r
ate swap agreements for trading purposes.Cash Flow Hedges 
— Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn connection with the issuanc
e of our January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange risk by effect
ively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denom inated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principalat maturity, to fixed
-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S.Dollars associated with the J
anuary 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%.We have designated these 
cross-currency swap agreements as qualify ing hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC815. The critical ter
ms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agree
ments mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.

We used the hypothetical d
erivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair v alues of these cross-currency swapagreements are re
cognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values ofthese cross-currency swap 
agreements are repo rted in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out ofaccumulated other co
mprehensive loss into non-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro-denominated Janua ry 2021 Notes isremeasured and the int
erest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recordedimmediately to non-ope
rating income, net. We evaluate the effe ctiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record anyineffectiveness for 
fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activitie
s and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.We do not use any cross-curren
cy swap agreements for trading purposes.Net Investment 
Hedge — Foreign Currency BorrowingsIn July 2013, we designated our July 2025 Notes as a n
et investment hedge of our investments in certain of our inte rnational subsidiaries that use the Euro as theirfunctional currency in o
rder to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to theU.S. 
Dollar. We used the spot method to me
asure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying va lueof the Euro-denominated July 2025 Not
es due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidatedbalance sheet and the r
emaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective po rtion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income, net in our consolidatedstatements of operat
ions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
We transact business in
 various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the eff
ects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or decreas
es in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign curren cy forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolatility associat
ed with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany sublicense 
fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreigncurrency forward contracts
 are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to cu rrency fluctuations will generally depend on thesize and type of cross-cur
rency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the netrealized 
and unrealized gains or loss es on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.Neither do we use these 
foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant toASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair v
alues of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance she ets with changes in fairvalues recorded to our consol
idated statements of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses andother current assets fo
r forward contracts in an unreal ized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. Thestatement of operations

classification for 
changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net, for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the no

ion for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of thelease terms.
Unconditional Obligations
In the 
ordinary course of business, we ent er into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify 
terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable p rice provisions; and the approximatetiming of the payment. We
 utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly andtesting of finished hardwar
e products. We also obtain indiv idual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projecteddemand information. Such purch
ase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fu lfillmentwithin agreed upon lead-ti
mes and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routinearrangements for othe
r materials and goods that are not related to our external manufact urers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinarycourse of business are not inc
luded in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

Our cloud, software and hardware produ
ct sales agreements generally include certain provisions for ind emnifying customers against liabilities if our productsinfringe a third party
’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabi
lities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifyingcustomers against liabilities i
n the event we breach confidentiality or service level requi rements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amountunder these indemnification
 agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involvedin each particular agreement.
Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS agreements gene
rally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in  the agreementduring the service period. Our so
ftware license and hardware products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate asdescribed in the applic
able program documentation for a per iod of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a mannerconsistent with industry standa
rds for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.We occasionally are 
required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, among others, guarantees rel
ated to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results 
of operations, financial position or cash flows. In connection with certa
in litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements with each ofthe surety bond issuing companies. Addi
tional information is provided in Note 18 below.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-Based 
Compensation Plans Stock Plans
In fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-T
erm Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restrictedstock-based awards, non-qualif
ied stock options and incentive stock options, as we ll as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligibleemployees, officers and d
irectors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board o
f Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000Plan), which extended the ter
mination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015shares. In fiscal 2014, our stockho
lders, upon the recommendation of our Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that maybe 
issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units(RSUs) and performance stock units 
(PSUs). The vesting schedule for RSUs is established by the Compensation Committee and generally requires vesting 25%annually over four years. The v
esting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Committee and currently requires achieving performance targetsand providing service 
over four fiscal years. Opt ions to purchase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable as established bythe Compensation Committee o
f the Board (generally 25% annually over four years under our current practice) and generally expire no mo re than 10 years fromthe date of grant. For each sh
are granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available forgrant. As of May 31, 2017, the 
2000 Plan had 68 million unvested RSUs outstanding, 6 m illion unvested PSUs outstanding and stock options to purchase305 million shares of common s
tock outstanding of which 232 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2017, approximately 217 mill ion shares of common stockwere available for fu
ture awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted 
the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified sto
ck options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’ Plan, 10 million sh
ares of common stock are reserved for issuance ( including a fiscal 2013 amendment

to increase the number o
f shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fairmarket value, that ves
t over four years, and expire no mor e than 10 years from the date of grant. The Directors’ Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016and permits the Compensation Com
mittee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each non -employee director uponfirst becoming a director an
d thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certainstockholder approved 
limitations set for th in the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2017, approximately 110,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchaseapproximately 2 mill
ion shares of common stock (of which approximately 1 million were vested) were outstanding under the Dire ctors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2017,approximately 2 mill
ion shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.In connection with certa
in of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective stock plans. Thes
e restricted stock-based awards and stock options g enerally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans underwhich they were originally gr
anted. As of May 31, 2017, approximately 9 million shares of restricted stock-based awards and stock options to purchase 5 millionshares of common stock were outs
tanding under these plans.The following table summar

were communicated to each 
participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based uponconsistent U.S. GAAP metrics or 
internal metrics that are defined,  fixed and consistently determined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore,these awards met the per
formance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.We estimated the f
air values of our stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation mod
els, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock pricevolatility. Changes in the inpu
t assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recogn ize as stock-based compensation expense. Thefair values of our stock opt

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We

We offer various defin
ed contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $366 million, $387 million and$362 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively. The number o f plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years as we havehired additional employ
ees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.In the United States, regula
r employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up 
to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g)limit as defined by the U.S. Int
ernal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, cu rrently 50% up to 6% of compensation each payperiod, subject to maximu
m aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $157 million, $153 million and $144million in 
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectiv ely.We also offer non-quali
fied deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual b ase and/or variable compensationuntil retirement or a date specifie
d by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately$487 million as of 
May 31, 2017 and were each approxima tely $419 million as of May 31, 2016 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilitiesin the accompanying consolid
ated balance sheets.We sponsor certain defin
ed benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are requ
ired by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or intogovernment-managed account
s consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total de fined benefit plan pension expenses were $85 million, $95million and $69 million fo
r fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of ourdefined benefit plans as o

   We provide for United States 
income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unl ess they areconsidered indefinite
ly reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2017, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and otheroutside basis temporary di
fferences of investments in foreign subsid iaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $47.5billion and $7.9 billion, respe
ctively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other outside basis differenc es were recognizedin a taxable transac
tion, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwisetaxable transaction. At M
ay 31, 2017, assuming a full utilization  of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporarydifferences of undistr
ibuted earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $15.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respective ly.Our net deferred tax asse
ts were $683 million and $1.1 billion as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe that it is more likel y than not that the netdeferred tax assets wil
l be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable incomein future years in 
appropriate tax jurisd ictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax creditcarryforwards. The amount of n
et deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of fut ure taxable income change.The valuation allowance was $1.2 bi
llion and $1.2 billion at each of May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substanti ally all of the valuation allowances as ofMay 31, 2017 and 2016 relate to tax ass
ets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and therecognition 
of the associated tax ben efits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes

subsequent to our final dete
rmination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.At May 31, 2017, we had federal net oper
ating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion. These losses expire in various years between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2036 and are subject to lim
itations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion at May 31, 2017, which expirebetween fiscal 2018 and fisc
al 2037 and are subject to limitations on their u tilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.9billion at May 31, 2017, which are subj
ect to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating losses are not cu rrentlysubject to expiration da
tes. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $187 million, expire between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2037. We had taxcredit carryforwards o
f approximately $1.8 billion at May 31, 2017, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $696 million of these taxcredit carryforwards are not
 currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $1.1 billion, expire in various y earsbetween fiscal 2018 and fisc
al 2038.We classify our unrecogni
zed tax benefits as either current or non-current income tax es payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregatechanges in the balance of ou

   As of May 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.8 bi
llion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect o ur effective tax rate ifrecognized. We recogni
zed interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements ofoperations of $125 million, $26 m
illion and $102 million during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2017 and2016 were $885 million and $765 mill
ion, respectively.Domestically, U.S. federal and s
tate taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2016. Many issues are at an advanc
ed stage in the examinat ion process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transferpricing, extraterritorial income exem
ptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits t aken. With all of thesedomestic audit issues consid
ered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2017, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related tothese audits could decre
ase (whether by payment, rele ase, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $389 million ($336 million net ofoffsetting tax benefi
ts). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to aud it for thoseperiods. Our U.S. state income tax r
eturns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer subject to audit forthose periods.
Internationally, tax 
authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it was reasonably possible that, as o
f May 31, 2017, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch as

$152 million ($78 million ne
t of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we are generally nolonger subject to tax 
examinations in non-U.S. jurisdic tions for years prior to fiscal 1997.We believe that we have 
adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audi ts. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomesor any related financ
ial statement effect thereof. On July 27, 2015, in Altera
Corp.
v.
Commissioner
 , the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion relat ed to the treatment of stock-based compensation 
expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstandingissues related to the c
ase. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requ irement to include stock-based compensation from itsregulations. We have rev
iewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at thistime. We will continue 
to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.We are under audit by 
the IRS and various other domesti c and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious challenges and li
tigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, India, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom, where the amounts under controversy ar
e significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes andaccrual of indirec
t taxes that may result from examinations by, or any n egotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings,and we believe that the
 final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicat
e payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period wedetermine the liabilities are no l
onger necessary. If our estimates of the federal,  state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than theultimate assessment, 
it could result in a further charge to expense.

SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280, 
Segment
 Reporting
, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise about which
 separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision make r, or decision-making group, indeciding how to allocate r
esources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and ChiefTechnology Officer. We ar
e organized by line of business and geographic ally. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line ofbusiness management struc
ture is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a grea
ter rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. Our CODMs view the operating results of our threebusinesses and allocate r
esources in a manner that is consistent with the changing m arket dynamics that we have experienced. As a result, during fiscal 2017, weupdated our operating segmen
ts. The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the Company’s perfor
mance and allocating Company resources.We have three businesses—c
loud and on-premise software, hardwa re and services—each of which are comprised of a single operating segment.Our cloud and on-premise softwar
e line of business markets, se lls and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies throughour cloud offerings and on-pre
mise software offerings. Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver certain of our applications, platfo rm andinfrastructure te
chnologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support. Our IaaS offerings also include OracleManaged Cloud Services, which are des
igned to provide comprehensive software and h ardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise,cloud-based or hybrid IT infr
astructures. Our cloud and on-premise software business also licenses our software products, generally on a perpetual basis, including Oracle Applications, Oracl
e Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among

others, for on-premise and o
ther IT environments. Customers that license our software have the option to purchase software license updates and product supportcontracts, which provide custo
mers with rights to software product upg rades and maintenance releases, patch releases, internet access to technical content, as wellas internet and telephon
e access to technical support personnel during the support period.Our hardware business provides Oracl
e Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris Operating Syste
m and management software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also includes hardware support, whichprovides customers with softwar
e updates for the software components that are essential to the funct ionality of the hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris andcertain other softwar
e, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.Our services business provides serv
ices to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard 
Company Litigation On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packa
rd Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corpor
ation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,defamation, intentional interference
 with prospective economic advantage, and vio lation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged thatwhen Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 th
at it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it breacheda settlement agre
ement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is our Chief Executive Officer and wasboth HP’s former chief execu
tive officer and chairman of HP’s board of dire ctors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights and obligations under theHurd Settlement Agreement 
and other equitable and monetary relief.Oracle answered the compl
aint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Or
acle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and hadmisrepresented to custo
mers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Orac le sought equitable rescission of the Hurd SettlementAgreement, and other e
quitable and monetary relief.The court 
bifurcated the tri al and tried HP’s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a finalstatement of decision on August 28, 2012, 
finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to cont inue to develop certain of its software products foruse on HP’s Itanium-based servers 
and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling). A jury trial began onMay 23, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a ve
rdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith andfair dealing and

against Oracle on its cl
aim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict). The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0 billion, and HP isentitled to post-judgmen
t interest on this award. On August 30, 2016, the court denied HP’s mot ion for pre-judgment interest. Judgment was entered on October 20,2016. Oracle posted certain 
court-mandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entere d into related indemnificationagreements with each of 
the surety bond issuing companies. Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November 14, 2016, which was denied.Oracle filed its noti
ce of appeal on January 17, 2017, specifying that it was appealing the trial court’s Phase One Ruling and Phase Two Jury Verdict. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of app
eal of the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operationseither prior to or subsequen
t to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict. We continue to b elieve that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims,and we intend to present these d
efenses to the appellate court. Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following: the trial court misapplied fundamental principl
es of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement, including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreementand the evidence of the pa
rties’ mutual intentions; that HP’s breach of contract c laim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not provethat Oracle failed 
to deliver any software under the trial court’s interpretation of the contract; that awarding HP both damages for breach of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific p
erformance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery; and that the damages award is excessive, unsupported by theevidence, and contrary to 
law. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surroundingthe appeal process and the n
ature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the resolut
ion of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results of operations.Derivative Litigation
On May 3, 
2017, a stockholder derivativ e lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The derivative suit is brought by an allegedstockholder of Oracle, purpor
tedly on Oracle’s behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology Off icer in his capacities as adirector, officer 
and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominaldefendant. Plaintiff 
alleges that the def endants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price.Plaintiff seeks decla
ratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction, unspecified monetary da mages (including interest), and disgorgementof various unspecified prof
its, fees, compensation, and benefits. The defendants are scheduled to respond to this complaint by July 19, 2017. While Oraclecontinues to evaluate 
these claims, we do not beli eve this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Other 
Litigation We are party to various o
ther legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings andclaims that relate to acquisition
s we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot bepredicted with certa
inty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially inexcess of amounts already 
recognized, if any.
