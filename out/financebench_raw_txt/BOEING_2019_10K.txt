Item 1. Business
The
 Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is one of the world’s majoraerospace firms.
We are organized based on the products and services w
e offer. We operate in four reportable segments:•
Commercial Airplanes (BCA);•
Defense, Space & Security ( BDS);•
Global Services ( BGS); •
Boeing Capital ( BCC). Commercial Airplanes Segment
This
 segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airlineindustry
 worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrumof
 global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model andthe 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-bo
dy models. Development continues on the 777X program and certain 737 MAX derivatives.Defense, Space & Security Segment
This
 segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systemsfor
 strike,  surveillance  and  mobility,  including  fighter  and  trainer  aircraft;  vertical  lift,  including  rotorcraft  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft;  and  commercialderivative

ng government and commercial satellites and space exploration.BDS'
 primary  customer  is  the United  States  Department  of  Defense ( U.S.  DoD).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  salesthrough
 the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately 84%  of  its 2019  revenues.  Other  significant BDS  customers  include  the  NationalAeronautics and Space Administratio
n (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.This
 segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46ATanker,
 and  T-7A  Red  Hawk.  This  segment  produces  rotorcraft  and  rotary-wing  programs,  such  as  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache,  and  V-22Osprey.
 Unmanned vehicles include the MQ-25, QF-16, and Insitu’s Scan Eagle aircraft. In addition, this segment's products include space andmissile
 systems  including:  government  and  commercial  satellites,  NASA’s  Space  Launch  System  (SLS),  the  International  Space  Station,Commercial Crew, missile defense and weap
ons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture.Global Services

Table of Contentsand
 logistics  management,  engineering,  maintenance  and  modifications,  upgrades  and  conversions,  spare  parts,  pilot  and  maintenance  trainingsystems and services, technical and maintenance doc
uments, and data analytics and digital services.Boeing Capital
 Segment BCC
 seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overallfinancing
 exposure. BCC ’s  portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assetsheld for sale or re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets,
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Employees
Total
 workforce level at December  31, 2019 was  approximately 161,100 .  As of December  31, 2019,  our principal collective bargaining agreementswere with the following unions:

The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  ourprocesses
 and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers withgreater value products.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonCompany, General Dynamics Corporation and S
paceX. Non-U.S.2

Table of Contentscompanie
s such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North Americanoperations
 and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors toaddress specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue i
nto 2020 . The
 commercial  and  defense  services  market  is  an  extremely  challenging  landscape  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering productsand
 services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance andengineering,
 modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highlycompetitive in 
2020 , and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high lev el of customer satisfaction and productivity.Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts.
 The  U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment
 contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted andcould require us to pay the difference between the orig
inal contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted fromthe original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us li
able for damages resulting from the default.Commercial
 Aircraft. In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements existfor
 airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the Europe
an Joint Aviation Authorities.Environmental.
 We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge,
 treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status andmanagement
 of  environmental  matters  to  ensure  our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.Investigation,
 remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal,recurring
 part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible thatcosts
 incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cashflows
 if  additional  work  requirements  or  more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwatercontamination are discovered and/or expa
nsions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site forwhich we were originally assi
gned a partial share, the statutory3

Table of Contentsframework
 would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, seeNote 
14  to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S.
 Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,including
 regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.sales are also subject to varying currency, political an
d economic risks.Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe sources could take a year or
 more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basiswith a number of companies.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, qualitystandards
 and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system tocontrol
 risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affectproduction
 schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  alsodependent on the availab
ility of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be se
asonal.Executive Officers of the Registrant

Table of ContentsForward-Looking Statements
This
 report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC, press and earnings releasesand
 other written and oral communications, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Actof
 1995.  Words  such  as  “may,”  “should,”  “expects,”  “intends,”  “projects,”  “plans,”  “believes,”  “estimates,”  “targets,”  “anticipates”  and  similarexpressions
 generally identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our futurefinancial condition and o
perating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.Forward-lo
oking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to beaccurate.
 These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors” section below and other important factors disclosed i
n this report and from time to time inour
 other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
 statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statementwhether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
An
 investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materiallyfrom
 our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the informationcontained in this report.
The
 737 MAX fleet is currently grounded, and we have temporarily suspended production of the 737 MAX. We are subject to a number ofrisks
 and  uncertainties  related  to  the  737  MAX.  These  risks  include  uncertainties  regarding  the  timing  and  conditions  of  737  MAXregulatory
 approvals,  delays  in  the  resumption  of  production,  lower  than  planned  production  rates  and/or  delivery  rates,  increasedconsiderations
 to customers, increased supplier costs and supply chain health, changes to the assumptions and estimates made in ourfinancial
 statements regarding the 737 program, and potential outcomes of various 737 MAX-related legal proceedings and governmentinvestigations.
On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft
 operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries ofthe
 737  MAX  have  been  suspended  until  clearance  is  granted  by  the  appropriate  regulatory  authorities.  The  grounding  has  reduced  revenues,operating
 margins, and cash flows, and will continue to do so until production and deliveries resume and production rates return to pre-groundinglevels.
 In  connection  with  the  effort  to  return  the  737  MAX  to  service,  we  have  developed  software  updates  for  the  737  MAX,  together  with  anassociated
 pilot training and supplementary education program. We continue to work with the FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities tocomplete
 remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service, including addressing their questions on the software updates andhow
 pilots  will  interact  with  the  airplane  controls  and  displays  in  different  flight  scenarios.  Any  delays  in  certification  and/or  the  resumption  ofdeliveries
 or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results ofoperations,
 and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperatingwith
 U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and theSecurities
 and Exchange Commission. Any adverse results with respect to any such litigation or investigation could have a further material impacton our financial position, results of operations a
nd/or cash flows.5

Table of ContentsDuring
 the second quarter of 2019, we announced plans to reduce the 737 production rate from 52 aircraft per month to 42 per month. During thefourth
 quarter  of  2019,  we  announced  plans  to  temporarily  suspend  737  MAX  production  beginning  in  January  2020.  Impacts  related  to  thereduction
 in  production  rate  followed  by  the  production  suspension  have  significantly  increased  costs  to  produce  aircraft  included  in  the  currentaccounting
 quantity and will result in reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins when deliveries resume. We have alsomade significa
nt assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory andthose
 estimated costs that will be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. If we are unable to return the 737 MAX aircraft to servicein
 one or more jurisdictions or begin deliveries to customers on the schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our current expectations, we will incursignificant
 additional costs and/or delay the resumption and subsequent ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significantadditional
 disruption to the 737 production system once production resumes and would further delay efforts to restore and/or implement previouslyplanned
 increases in the 737 production rate. Cash flows continue to be negatively impacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costsand
 inventory levels, and payments made to customers in connection with disruption to their operations. In addition, we have experienced claimsand assertions from
 customers in connection with the grounding, and we recorded an earnings charge of $8,259 million , net of insurance recoveries of
 $500 million, in 2019, in connection with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to thegrounding and associated deli
very delays.Any
 further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX, the resumption of 737 production and/or deliveries, further disruptions to suppliers and/orthe long-term health of
 the production system, supplier claims or assertions, or changes to estimated concessions or other considerations we expectto
 provide to customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. The FAA and othernon-U.S.
 civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed thatregulatory
 approval will enable 737 MAX deliveries to resume during mid-2020. This assumption reflects our best estimate at this time based onfactors
 such as the estimated duration of regulatory approval and final pilot training requirements. In the event of unanticipated additional trainingrequireme
nts in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval, and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries, we may be required to takeactions
 with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our  production  plans,  employment  reductions  and/or  the  expenditure  of  significantresources to support our supply chain and/or customers.
We
 have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period during which thoseunits
 are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routinewarranty
 costs.  In  addition  to  the  estimated  timing  of  the  resumption  of  deliveries,  we  have  made  assumptions  regarding  outcomes  of  accidentinvestigations
 and other government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply chainhealth
 as  we  implement  our  production  plans,  as  well  as  outcomes  of  negotiations  with  customers.  Any  changes  in  these  estimates  and/orassumptions
 with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Foradditional
 information,  see  our  discussion  under  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis-Critical  Accounting  Policies  and  Estimates-737  MAXGrounding” on page 
45 .Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.
Market
 conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  ispredominantly
 driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  aresustained
 economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influencedby
 airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price andother competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics
6

Table of Contentsand environmenta
l regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swingsand
 constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, orthe
 financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers toseek
 to  postpone  or  cancel  contractual  orders  and/or  payments  to  us,  which  could  result  in  lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  areduction
 in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period ofseveral years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect del
iveries over a long period.We enter into
 firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overrunsor if
 increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft  sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraftare
 delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of afixed
 amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based oncurrent
 expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors canfluctuate
 significantly  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in  escalation  amounts  can  significantly  impact  revenues  and  operating  margins  in  ourCommercial Airplanes business.
We
 derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production ratetargets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. Inaddition,
 the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  programs  and/or  derivatives,  such  as  the  777X,  involves  increased  risks  associated  with  meetingdevelopment,
 testing, production, and certification schedules. The 737 program has also experienced significant disruption due to the grounding ofthe
 737 MAX and associated suspension of 737 MAX production. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customerrequirements, and achieve or maintain, as applic
able, program profitability is subject to significant risks.We
 must  minimize  disruption  caused  by  production  changes  and  achieve  productivity  improvements  in  order  to  meet  customer  demand  andmaintain
 our profitability. We  have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, as well as to resume 737 MAXproduction
 at  low  levels  once  timing  and  conditions  of  return  to  service  are  better  understood.  At  the  same  time  we  are  engaging  in  significantongoing
 development, testing and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building ouraircraft,
 including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing howwe
 manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption toour
 production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may beunable to meet delivery schedules an
d/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.Operational
 challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delaysand/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either

Table of Contentsof which would negatively impact our reven
ues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues,
 including  delays  or  defects  in  supplier  components,  failure  to  meet  internal  performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  requiredregulatory
 approval,  such  as  the  with  the  737 MAX,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  and increased  production  costs,  as  well asdelayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs.
If our
 commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We derive a substanti
al portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD . Levels of U.S. defense
 spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threat,U.S. foreign policy, the
 domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislationsuch as authorization and appropriati
ons bills.The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised preexisting spending limits on federal discretionary defense and non-defense spending for fiscal years2020
 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty and the risk of sequestration. Although FY20 appropriations have been enacted andFY21
 topline  funding  levels  have  been  agreed  to,  the  timeliness  of  FY21  and  future  appropriations  for  government  departments  and  agenciesremains
 a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations for government department or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown,which
 could  impact  the  Company’s  operations.  Alternatively,  Congress  may  fund  government  departments  and  agencies  with  one  or  moreContinuing
 Resolutions; however, this could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition,long-term
 uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending beyond FY21 and it is likely that the U.S. government discretionaryspending levels will co
ntinue to be subject to pressure.In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to
 future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD  and other government
 agencies  (including  NASA),  including  tension  between  modernization  and  sustainment  investments,  within  the  overall  budgetaryframework
 described  above.  Future  budget  cuts  or  investment  priority  changes,  including  changes  associated  with  the  authorizations  andappropriations
 process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have amaterial effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial pos
ition and/or cash flows.In
 addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  levels  and  the  nature  of  the  threatenvironment,
 we  also  expect  the U.S.  DoD to  continue  to  emphasize  affordability,  innovation,  cybersecurity,  and  delivery  of  technical  data  andsoftware in its procurement processes. If we can
 no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition policies our revenues and market sharecould be impacted.

Table of ContentsWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to un
ique risks.In 
2019,  39% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government  contracts,  which include foreign military sales (FMS)  through the U.S.government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subj
ect to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and cha
nges to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement
 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperating
 margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject toadditional
 costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.Compliance
 costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial conditionand operating results.
The
 U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The  U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail orterminate
 its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,funding
 pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due tofiscal
 constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programscould also
 result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”rather
 than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination ofone or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnin
gs, cash flow and/or financial position.We
 are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.government
 contracts. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 70%  and 73%  of their 2019  revenues  from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-pricecontracts
 enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced marginsor
 incurring  losses if we are  unable to achieve estimated  costs  and revenues.  If  our estimated  costs  exceed our estimated  price,  we recognizereach-forward
 losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, in 2019, we recorded reach-forward losses of $489 million  on the
 Commercial  Crew  contract  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  spacecraft  completion,  certification  and  testing,  andadditional reach-forward losses of 
$148 million  on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting hig her manufacturing costs. New programs could also haverisk for
 reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. For example, in 2018, in connection with winning theT-7A Red
9

Table of ContentsHawk and MQ-25 competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 milli
on associated with options for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and a loss of $291 millionrelated
 to  the  MQ-25  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)  contract.  The  long  term  nature  of  many  of  our  contracts  makes  theprocess of
 estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penaltiestied
 to performance  which can be difficult  to estimate and have significant impacts on margins.  In addition, some of our contracts  have specificprovisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.
Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price
 development  contracts  include  Commercial  Crew, KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25,  andcommercial and military satellites.
We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 30%  and 27%  of their 2019  revenues  from cost-type contracting arrangements.Some
 of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award orincentiv
e fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily inreduced
 fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  areprimarily cost-type include 
Ground-based Midcourse Defense  ( GMD), Proprietary and SLS  programs.We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Our
 ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financialstability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and o
ther components.We rely on other companies including U.S. and n
on-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated componentsand
 sub-assemblies,  and production commodities  and to perform  some of the services that we provide to our customers.  If one or more  of oursuppliers
 or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meetcommitments
 to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,titanium
 or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in atimely
 fashion  or  at  budgeted  costs.  In  some  instances,  we  depend  upon  a  single  source  of  supply.  Any  service  disruption  from  one  of  thesesuppliers,
 either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems orfinancial difficulties, could have a materia
l adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.10

Table of ContentsWe
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for scheduleand
 technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables.
 Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program becausecosts
 also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related toperformance
 on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assessanticipated
 performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of awardfees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actua
l and anticipated awards.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period overwhich
 the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and othernon-recurring
 costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters ofintent
 from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes toprice
 escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/orcertification
 issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financialperformance.
Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits, see our
 discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”on pages 
44  – 45 and Note 1  to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 57  – 69 of this Form 10-K.Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers
 of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industryconsolidation,
 fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD  and  non-U.S.customers
 will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. andnon-U.S.
 competitors  facing  BCA  and  BDS.  Furthermore,  we  are  facing  increased  international  competition  and  cross-border  consolidation  ofcompetition.
 There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  compete  successfully  against  our  current  or  future  competitors  or  that  thecompetitive pressures we face will not result in reduced reven
ues and market share.11

Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In 
2019,  non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 55%  of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continueto
 account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally,including:
•
changes in regulatory requirements; •
U.S.  and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrialcooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activ ities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information andinformation
 technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorizedaccess,
 release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,and/or we could face financial losses.
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financi
al position and results of operations. In addition, we12

Table of Contentsare subject to extensive regulation under the laws of
 the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As aresult,
 we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationshipswith
 the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownershipof
 certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact onour financial position and results of operati
ons.A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio isalso
 concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that webelieve
 have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financialdifficulties
 or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonableterms,
 or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/orfinancial position could b
e materially adversely affected.We
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend,  in  part,  upon  the  issuance  of  debt  to  fund  our  operations  and  contractual  commitments.  As  of December  31,  2019 and 2018,  ourairplane
 financing commitments totaled $13,377  and $19,462 .  In addition, our debt balances increased significantly in 2019, and we expect furtherincreases in 2020, in order to
 manage liquidity impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding. This has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings.If
 we  require  additional  funding  in  order  to  fund  outstanding  financing  commitments,  address  further  737  MAX  impacts,  or  meet  other  businessrequirements,
 our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greaterdifficulty accessi
ng public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline inour financial performan
ce, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding The occurrence of any or all of these eventsmay adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financ
ing commitments.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. For example, in 2018we
 completed  the  acquisition  of  KLX  Inc.,  a  provider  of  aviation  parts  and  services.  Whether  we  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  theseacquisitions
 and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of theunderlying
 product  and  service  portfolio,  and  the  performance  of  the  management  team  and  other  personnel  of  the  acquired  operations.Accordingly,
 our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges,amortization
 of  expenses  related  to  intangibles,  charges  for  impairment  of  long-term  assets,  credit  guarantees,  partner  performance  andindemnifications.
 Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that wehave
 established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will besuccessful.
 We  also  may  make  strategic  divestitures  from  time  to  time.  These  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial  involvement  in  thedivested businesses, such as through guara
ntees or other financial arrangements,13

Table of Contentsfollowing
 the  transaction.  Nonperformance  by  those  divested  businesses  could  affect  our  future  financial  results  through  additional  paymentobligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances,
 we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  orliabilities
 and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircrafttechnologies,
 missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable oncommercially
 reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the2002
 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurancecoverage we maintain may be inadeq
uate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our
 business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damagingweather
 or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or ourability
 to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of ourdata, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 
57,000  employees, which constitute 35%  of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2019 . We experienced a work
 stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11  U.S. labororganizations
 and 13  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  ourfinancial
 condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Workstoppages
 and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationshipswith customers and cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.Substantial
 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cashflows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatoryamounts
 required under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act and  discretionary  contributions  to improve  the plans'  funded status. Theextent
 of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions  could have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders'  equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individu
al contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards14

Table of Contentswhich
 can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of healthcare
 coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.  Our  estimates  of  future  costs  associated  with  these  benefits  are  also  subject  toassumptions,
 including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected bypension and other postretirement plan accou
nting policies, see “ Management' s Discussion and Analysis- Critical Accounting Policies- Pension Plans” on page 
48  of this Form 10-K. Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) expense and pension orother
 postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect theamount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.
Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  anindemnification
 agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  morestringent
 enforcement  of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediationrequirements
 could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14  to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a
 global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,missile
 defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for theworldwide
 commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  weconduct operations in an expand
ing number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our
 strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA ), Defense, Space & Security ( BDS), andGlobal Services (
BGS )  – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital  ( BCC).  Taken together, these core businesses have historically generatedsubstantial
 earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing theservices that the market
 demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior des
ign, safety, efficiency and value tocustomers
 around  the  world. BDS  integrates  its  resources  in  defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and  services  to  delivercapability-driven
 solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-generationprograms
 while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides
 support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive,  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service  solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financin
g solutions for our Boeing customers.On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft
 operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries ofthe
 737  MAX  have  been  suspended  until  clearance  is  granted  by  the  appropriate  regulatory  authorities.  The  grounding  is  having  a  significantadverse impact on our operations and creates signific
ant uncertainty. We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service.19

decreased  by $24,568 million in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily  due to lower revenues at BCA, partially offset by higher revenues atBGS.
 Lower  BCA  revenues  are  primarily  driven  by  lower  737  MAX  deliveries  and  a  revenue  reduction  of $8,259  million recorded  in  2019  forestimated
 potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  for  disruptions  and  associated  delivery  delays  related  to  the  737  MAXgrounding, net of insurance recoveries.
Revenues 
increased  by $7,122 million in 2018 compared  with 2017 due to higher revenues at BCA, BDS, and BGS. BCA  revenues increased  by $2,887
 million due  to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BDS
 revenues increased  by $2,454 million primarily due to non-US contract award s for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft saleand higher satellites revenue
. BGS revenues increased  by $2,445 million due to higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX , Inc. (KLX) in the fourth qua

Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See page 42 .Loss
 from operations was $1,975  million in 2019 compared  with earnings from  operations  of $11,987  million in 2018.  The decrease of $13,962 million
 is  primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million  in  2019 compared to earnings from operations of $7,830 million  in  2018,partially offset by
 higher earnings at BDS and BGS in 2019 compared with 2018. BCA decreased by $14,487 million  due  to lower 737 deliveries andthe
 earnings charge for the 737 MAX grounding of $8,259  million,  net of insurance recoveries. BDS  earnings from operations increased  by $951million
 primarily  due to lower charges in 2019 for development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased  by $161 million primarily due  tohigher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorab
le performance and mix.Earnings
 from operations increased by $1,643 million  in  2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which morethan
 offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,545 million
 due to higher revenues and  improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improvedcost
 performance and favorable delivery mix.  BGS earnings from operations increased by $285  million primarily  due to higher  revenues, partiallyoffset
 by higher period costs.  BDS earnings from operations decreased by $726  million as  earnings growth from higher revenues was more thanoffset
 by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 competitions, as well as higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forwardlosses.
During
 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $148  million, $736 million,  and $445  million, respectively.
Core operating earnings 
decreased  by $14,050 million in 2019 compared with 2018  primarily due  to a loss from operations at BCA in 2019, partiallyoffset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS.

 The net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in 2019 was consistent with 2018, as reductions in current year servicecost
 were offset by higher amortization of prior year service costs. The decrease in net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a low

Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  eachcommercial airplan
e program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of salespercentage
 applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.Substantially
 all contracts at our BDS  segment and certain contracts at our BGS  segment  are long-term contracts with the U.S. government andother
 customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded as incurred. Cost of sales for commercial spareparts is recorded at average cost.

Table of ContentsGlobal Trade 
We  continually monitor the global trade environment for changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions or other potential geopoliticaleconomic developments that may impact the company.
Beginning
 in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.trading
 partners  have  imposed,  or  announced  their  intention  to  impose,  tariffs  on  U.S.  goods.  In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Government,  Mexico  andCanada
 reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs between these countries. Passage of the U.S./Mexico/Canada Free TradeAgreement
 (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remainingglobal tariffs.
Since
 2018,  the  U.S.  and  China  imposed  tariffs  on  approximately  $34  billion  of  each  other's  exports  in  July  2018.  Certain  aircraft  parts  andcomponent
s that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods,and
 China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. The U.S. and China Phase I agreement in January 2020 is a positivedevelopment for overall trade with China. Neg
otiations to resolve remaining trade issues continue.Overall global trade tensions and incre
ased market uncertainty have resulted in fewer orders than anticipated for our commercial aircraft.The
 U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or  consider  imposing  sanctions  on  certain  businesses  and  individuals  in  Russia.  Although  ouroperations
 or  sales  in  Russia  have  not  been  impacted  to  date,  we  continue  to  monitor  additional  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, bus

Business Environment and Trends
Airline
 Industry Environment Global  economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was 2.6% in 2019, slightly below the long-term average ofapproximately
 3%. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 4% to 5% in 2019, close to the long-term average of approximately 5%. The groundingof
 the  737  MAX  and  suspension  of  737  MAX  deliveries  has  slowed  growth  at  certain  airlines.  While  growth  was  solid  across  most  major  worldregions,
 there  continues  to  be  variation  between  regions  and  airline  business  models.  Despite  some  moderation  in  the  growth  rates,  airlinesoperating in Asia Pacific and Euro
pe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are leading the 2019 growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth isexpected to contract this year due to weak global trade growth.
Airline
 financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances,partnerships,
 new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducingcosts and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airpla
nes. Net profits in 2019 are expected to approximate $26 billion.The
 long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and theincreasi
ng propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights betweencountries. Our
 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.6% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based onlong-term
 global economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.8 trillion market for approximately 44,000 newairplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerab
le to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, actsof terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global e
nvironmental regulations.25

Table of ContentsIndustry
 Competitiveness The  commercial  jet  airplane  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  Market  liberalization  inEurope,
 the  Middle  East  and  Asia  is  enabling  low-cost  airlines  to  continue  gaining  market  share.  These  airlines  are  increasing  the  pressure  onairfares.
 This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensurea favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.
Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in d
ollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.We
 face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access tomost
 of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries have significantlyreduced
 our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft in 2019 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain moreorders
 and increase market share. We are continuing to monitor the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our suppliers and working to ensure thatour
 supply chain can support our production plans once production resumes. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily tocreate
 a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbuscontinues
 to  expand  in  the  100-150  seat  transcontinental  market.  Additionally,  other  competitors  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan  are  developingcommercial jet aircraft. Some of
 these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,”which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane developme
nt activities. This has enabled the development of airplaneswithout
 commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-basedprices.
 Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining marketshare
 and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expectthese pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.
We
 are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service, improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, whichenhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on takin
g actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.26

 revenues decreased  by $25,244 million in 2019 compared  with 2018  driven  by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259million
 that was recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions and associated deliverydelays
 related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of $500 million of insurance recoveries. BCA revenues increased  by $2,887 million in 2018 compared with 
2017  primarily  due  to higher  737  and  787  deliveries  and  favorable  737  and  787  model  mix,  which  more  than  offset  lower  777  and  747deliveries

BCA
 loss from operations was $6,657 million  in 2019 compared  with earnings from operations of $7,830 million  in 2018.  The decrease of $14,487 million
 is  primarily due to lower 737 deliveries and earnings charges related to the 737 MAX. The 737 MAX grounding and associated changes toour production rate will continue to adversely imp
act 737 program and overall BCA margins.BCA
 earnings  from  operations increased  by $2,545  million in 2018 compared  with 2017 .  The  increase  in  operating  earnings  reflects higher revenues
 and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performanceand favorable delivery mix

Table of ContentsBacklog
Our
 total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers wherewe
 believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required toperform.
 Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approvalfrom
 its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or haveexpired
 prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A numberof our customers may
 have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly laterthan
 the  contractual  delivery  date.  We  address  customer  claims  and  requests  for  other  contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  The  value  of  orders  inbacklog is adjuste
d as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
BCA
 total backlog of $376,593 million  at December 31, 2019 decreased  from $408,140 million  at December 31, 2018,  primarily due to deliveries inexcess of new orders and a
 reduction in backlog related to orders from a customer that experienced liquidity issues. We are experiencing fewer new737
 MAX  orders  than  we  were  receiving  prior  to  the  grounding.  If  737  MAX  aircraft  remain  grounded  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  we  mayexperience
 reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order  cancellations.  To  date,  the  737  MAX  grounding  has  not  resulted  in  significant  ordercancellations.
Accounting
 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram,
 including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantitiesquarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.

. 747 Program
 We  are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We believe that ending production of the 747 at the end of the currentaccounting quantity would not hav
e a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767
 Program The  767  assembly  line  includes  the  commercial  program  and  a  derivative  to  support  the  tanker  program.  We  are  increasing  ourcombined production rate from 2.5 to 3 per month in 2020.
777
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2019 due to the program’s normal progress of obtainingadditional orders and delivering airplanes. In 2013, we launched the 777X,
 which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips.We
 have experienced issues in engine design and development on the 777X. The first flight of the 777X was completed on January 25, 2020, andfirst
 delivery is targeted for 2021. The 777 and 777X programs have a combined production rate of 5 per month. We plan to produce more 777models and fewer 777X
 models in the near term than previously planned. We expect to deliver at an average rate of 3 per month in 2020. The 777Xwill have a separate program accounting q
uantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery.787
 Program At  the end of the first quarter of 2019, we increased the production rate from 12 per month to 14 per month. As a result of fewerorders than anticipated, we plan to reduce the 787
 production rate to 12 per month in late 2020 and to 10 per month in early 2021. We plan to returnto a production rate of 12 per month in 2023.

Table of ContentsFleet Support
 We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1%  of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well asthose
 of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, suchas
 the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliveraircraft
 on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significantrisks.
 Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses)include the followi
ng: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalationfactors
 due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic  indicators,  performance  or  reliability  issues  involving  completed  aircraft,  capitalexpenditures
 and  other  costs  associated  with  increasing  or  adding  new  production  capacity,  learning  curve,  additional  change  incorporation,achieving
 anticipated  cost  reductions,  flight  test  and  certification  schedules,  costs,  schedule  and  demand  for  new  airplanes  and  derivatives  andstatus
 of  customer  claims,  supplier  claims  or  assertions  and  other  contractual  negotiations.  While  we  believe  the  cost  and  revenue  estimatesincorporated
 in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk asadditional completion costs may become necessary
 or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, ordercancellations or other financially si
gnificant exposure.Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the Budget Control Act limits on federal discretionary defense and non-defense spending for fiscal years2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY2
1), reducing budget uncertainty30

Table of Contentsand
 the  risk  of  sequestration.  The  consolidated  appropriations  acts  for  FY20,  enacted  in  December  2019,  provided  FY20  appropriations  forgovernment
 departments  and  agencies,  including  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD),  the  National  Aeronautics  and  SpaceAdministration (NASA) and the Federal Aviati
on Administration (FAA).The
 enacted FY20 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64Apache,
 V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to futureprogram-level
 appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,including
 changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial positi
on and/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense
 Environment Overview The non-U.S.  market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the needto
 modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and theMiddle East given the diverse regiona
l threats. At the end of 2019, 29%  of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations

  1  1 Revenues
BDS
 revenues in 2019  decreased by $165 million compared  with 2018  due  to timing  associated with non-U.S. contract awards for fighters and thefinal
 C-17 sale in 2018, lower revenue related to charges on Commercial Crew, and lower volume from certain unmanned and vertical lift programs. These
 reductions were partially offset by increases from new programs, including E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25,as
 well as from satellites and weapons. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $163 million  higher  thanthe comparable period in the prior year, reflecting unfavorab
le adjustments on the Commercial Crew contract and less favorable performance.BDS
 revenues  in  2018 increased  by $2,454  million compared  with  2017  primarily  due  to non-US  contract  awards  for  fighters,  higher  weaponsrevenue,
 the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue.  The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was$359
 million higher  than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in2018.
Earnings From Operations
BDS
 earnings from operations in 2019  increased by $951 million compared with 2018  primarily due to lower net  charges on development programs. In
 2019, BDS recorded charges of $143 million  compared with $722 million  in  2018 related to the KC-46A Tanker contract. Also during 2019, BDSrecorded charges of $489 millio
n compared with $57 million in 2018 related to the Commercial Crew contract. In 2018, we recorded charges of $691million
 related to losses on the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019was 
$62 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting lo wer net unfavorable adjustments on development programs.BDS

 in 2018 was $412  million  higher than the comparable period in the prior year, driven by higher charges on development programs in2018.
BDS
 earnings  from  operations  include equity  earnings  of $128  million, $147 million and $183  million primarily  from  our  ULA  and  non-U.S.  jointventures in 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Backlog
Total
 backlog of $63,908 million  at December 31, 2019 increased  by 4%  from $61,277 million  at December 31, 2018,  primarily due to current yearcontract awards in
 many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant orders included F/A-18 fighters, Space Launch System, P-8APoseidon, KC-46A Tanker, and E-7 Airborn
e Early Warning & Control, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals fornew
 programs.  Examples  of  significant  fixed-price  development  programs  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25BPresidential
 Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract awardand
 during  the  period  of  contract  performance.  Many  development  programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  As  technical  or  quality  issues  ariseduring
 development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduceour
 estimated  price,  either  of  which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  areongoing,
 and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of theseprograms
 creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which couldtrigger
 termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk forreach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.
KC-46A
 Tanker The KC-46A  Tanker is  a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S.  Air Force(
USAF)  to design, develop, manufacture and deliver next generation aerial refueling tankers. The contract contains production options for both lowrate initial production (LRIP) aircraft and
 full rate production aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five LRIP lots for a total of 67 aircraft. TheEngineering, Manufacturing
 and Development (EMD) contract and the five authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $15 billion. If all optionsunder
 the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019,we delivered the first KC-46A to the USAF, and by December 201
9, we had delivered a total of 28  aircraft.During
 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445  million  related to this program, primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated withcertification
 and  incorporating  changes  into  LRIP  aircraft.  During  2018,  we  recorded  additional  reach-forward  losses  of $736  million primarily reflecting
 higher estimated costs associated with certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expectedeffort
 to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. During 2019, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of$148 million
 reflecting higher manufacturing costs. 33

Table of ContentsAs
 with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery delays if we experience furtherproduction, technical or quality issues.
Commercial
 Crew NASA  has contracted  us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft  to transport  crews to the International  SpaceStation.
 On December 20, 2019 the Starliner launched and successfully landed two days later completing an abbreviated uncrewed flight test thatperformed
 many mission objectives before returning to Earth as the first orbital land touchdown of a human-rated capsule in U.S. history. The flighttest
 was abbreviated, however, because anomalies experienced during the mission prevented docking with the International Space Station. In thefourth
 quarter of 2019, we recorded an increase to the reach-forward loss of $410 million ,  primarily to provision for another uncrewed mission. Rootcause analysis is underway and N
ASA is evaluating the data received during the mission to determine if another uncrewed mission is required.T-7A
 Red Hawk In  September 2018, we were selected by the USAF  to  build the next generation training capability, known as T-7A Red Hawk(formerly
 T-X Trainer). The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and ground equipment. The contract is structured as anindefinite
 delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price
 contract  valued  at  $813  million  and  includes  five  aircraft  and  seven  simulators,  with  a  period  of  performance  that  runs  through  2022.  Theproduction
 and support contracts are structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winningthis
 competition in 2018, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that webelieve
 are  probable  of  being  exercised.  During  2019,  we  completed  the  aircraft’s  critical  design  review.  We  believe  that  our  investment  in  thiscontract positions us for additional market opportunities for both trainer and l
ight attack aircraft.MQ-25 
In  August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract thatincludes development
 and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning this competition, werecognized
 a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. In 2019, we conducted a successful firstflight.
 The MQ-25 is the U.S. Navy’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positionsus for long-term leadership in autonomy and artificial inte
lligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.United

 services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S.government services market is the single largest individu
al market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over thenext
 decade,  we  expect  U.S.  growth  to  remain  flat  and  non-U.S.  fleets,  led  by  Middle  East  and  Asia  Pacific  customers,  to  add  rotorcraft  andcommercial derivativ

BGS
 earnings  from operations in 2019  increased  by $161  million compared  with 2018 . The increase in earnings from operations reflects higherrevenues,
 which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix. Earnings from operations for 2019 also includes a divestiture gain of$395 million and a
 charge of $293 million related to our decision in the fourth quarter to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 
2019  was $21 million  higher than the comparable period in the prior year . BGS
 earnings  from operations in 2018  increased by $285 million compared  with 2017  primarily  due to higher  revenues, partially offset by higherperiod

BCC’s
 gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December  31, 2019 totaled $2,254  million.  A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio isrelated to
 customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeingaircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.
BCC
 provided  customer  financing  of  $419 million  and $601  million during 2019  and 2018 .  While  we may be required  to fund a number  of newaircraft
 deliveries in 2020 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable pricesfrom broad and globally diverse sources.
Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-builtcommercial jet aircraft (
8.5%  of current  world fleet) were parked at the end of 2019 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of
 these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2018  and 2017 , 6.7% and 8.3%  of the western-builtcommercial
 jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively fewoperators, are placed out of service.

 we continued to produce aircraft while deliveries were suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion  in  2019, ascompared with 
$2.6 billion  in 2018. In December 2019, we announce d plans to temporarily suspend production of the 737 MAX beginning in January2020. This

 Activities Cash  used by investing activities during 2019 , 2018 and 2017  was $1.5  billion, $4.6 billion and $2.1  billion.  The reduction in2019
 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net ofcash
 acquired were $0.5 billion  in 2019,  compared with $3.2 billion  in 2018,  primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositionswas 
$0.5 billion in  2019 as a result of the divestiture of two businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion  in 2019,  relatively consistent with$1.7 billion
 in 2018 and 2017 . We expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be relative ly consistent with 2019 . Net proceeds from investments was $0.1 billion
 in 2019, $0.3 billion in 2018, and was insignificant in 2017 . Financing
 Activities Cash  provided by financing activities was $5.7  billion during 2019 ,  compared with cash used by financing activities of $11.7 billion
 in  2018. The increase of $17.5  billion compared  with 2018  primarily  reflects higher net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partiallyoffset
 by higher dividend payments in 2019. Cash used by financing activities was $11.7  billion during 2018 ,  an increase of $0.4  billion compared with 
2017,  primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Net borrowings were $13.2 billion  in 2019, $1.4 billionin 
2018 and $1.1 billion  in 2017. At 
December 31, 2019 and 2018  the  recorded balance of debt was $27.3 billion  and $13.8 billion  of which $7.3 billion  and $3.2 billion  was classified as
 short-term. At December  31, 2019 and 2018  this  included $2.0 billion  and $2.5 billion  of  debt attributable to BCC ,  of which $0.5 billion  and $0.5 billion
 were classified as short-term. During 
2019  and 2018  we  repurchased 6.9  million and 26.1  million shares  totaling $2.7  billion and $9.0  billion through  our  open  market  sharerepurchase program. In 
2019  and 2018 , we had 0.6 million  shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2019 , the amount
 available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 17, 2018 , totaled $17.3 billion .  Share repurchases under this plan arecurrently suspended. We
 increased our quarterly dividend from $1.71 to $2.055 in December 2018, which resulted in $684 million  of higher dividend payments in 2019 compared with 2018.
Capital
 Resources We  have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debtcovenants
 as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December  31, 2019, 2018, and 
2017,  commercial  paper  borrowings  totaling $6,109  million, $1,895 million and $600  million,  respectively,  which  were  supported  by  unusedcommitments under the revolving credit agreement. At 
December 31, 2019 , we had $9.6 billion  of  unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit lineagreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as back
up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Customer financing commitments totaled 
$13.4 billion  and $19.5 billion  at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The  decrease primarily relates to financingcommitment expirati
ons and terminations. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as wecontinue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative fina
ncing to customers. Historically, we have not been38

Table of Contentsrequired
 to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greateramounts than historically required.
As
 previously  announced,  we  plan  to  acquire  an  80%  ownership  stake  in  a  joint  venture  comprised  of  the  commercial  aircraft  and  servicesoperations of Embraer for $4.2 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.
In
 the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorableresolution of litigation or other
 loss contingencies, or other business requirements, including impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding, we expect tomeet
 increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources shouldbe
 sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantageof
 potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability offuture borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets.
As
 of January 31, 2020, we have received commitments from a syndicate of banks sufficient for us to enter into a $12 billion delayed draw two-yearterm
 loan credit facility. This facility may be increased at the Company’s option if the facility is oversubscribed. The facility will enhance our liquidityand is expected to close in February 2020.
At 
December 31, 2019 and 2018,  our pension plans were $15.9 billion  and $15.3 billion  underfunded  as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement
 Income Security Act ( ERISA)  basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2019 .  We do not expect to make significantcontributions to our pension plans in 
2020 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension pla ns in future years.At 
December  31,  2019,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  alimitation
 on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  as  a  percentage  of  consolidated  net  tangible  assets  (as  defined  in  the  creditagreements),
 and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue tohave substantial bor
rowing capacity.39

ors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need forsuch
 arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portionof
 these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customersfor
 penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for programand

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America(
GAAP)  which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or asa
 substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review ourfinancial
 statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  coreoperatin
g margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents thedifference
 between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Coreearnings
 per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operatingpension
 and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprisingservice
 and  prior  service  costs  computed  in  accordance  with  GAAP  are  allocated  to  BCA  and  certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercialcustomers.
 Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  government  customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.Government
 Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costsare
 allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generallybased on benefits paid.
The
 Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2019  was  a benefit of $1,071  million,  largelyconsistent with a benefit of 
$1,005 million  in 2018 and $1,127 million  in 2017. The non-operating  pension expense included in Other income, net  was a
 benefit of $374  million in 2019, $143 million in 2018 and $117  million in 2017.  The benefits in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reflect expected returns inexcess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates
Accounting for long-term contracts
Substantially
 all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinctperformance
 obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant serviceof integration that we provide.
Accounting
 for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation.Cost
 of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reportedas cost of sales.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicatedand subject
 to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflation
 or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based onestimated
 cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  bereimbursed
 in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, busin
ess volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and
 cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in theseestimates
 could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of salesand
 profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or anadjustment
 to  a  reach-forward  loss,  which  would  be  recorded  immediately  in  earnings.  For  the  years  ended  December  31, 2019  and 2018  net unfavorab
le cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by$111
 million and $190  million.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,  net  favorable  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments,  including  reach-forwardlosses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by $2
50 million.Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if weused different
 assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,or
 circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contractperformance
 obligations for all of 2019  had  been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income forthe year by approximately 
$330 million . In  addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changesto estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.

Table of ContentsProgram Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accountingquantity.
 A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-termproduction
 effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to makereasonably
 dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost ofsales
 is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  for  the  total  remaining  program  to  the  amount  of  sales  recognized  forairplanes delivered and acc
epted by the customer.Factors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof
 intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and salesprice for all unsold units within 
the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales pricesfor
 all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates arebased
 largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economicprojections.
 Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/orsupplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticip
ated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Changes  inestimates
 are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues fromundelivered
 units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in theaccounting quantity.
The
 program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.Because of the higher unit production costs experi
enced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling andother
 non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  such  as  the  777X  program,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  than  establishedprograms.
 In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantityare
 included  within  program  inventory  as  deferred  production  costs.  Deferred  production,  unamortized  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs  areexpected
 to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity  are delivered as the expected unit cost  for later  deliveries  is below theestimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are real
ized.Due to the significance of
 judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances orassumptions
 could  have  a  material  effect  on  program  gross  margins.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  percentages  for  our  commercial  airplaneprograms had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it woul
d have an approximately $400 million  impact on operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019
. 737 MAX Grounding
On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft operators
 following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. The groundingis having a significant adverse impact on our op
erations and creates significant uncertainty.45

Table of ContentsMultiple legal actions
 have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accidentof Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further,
 we are fully cooperating with all ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating tothe
 accidents  and  the  737  MAX,  including  investigations  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Wecannot
 reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these lawsuits,investig
ations, and inquiries. We have also experienced claims and/or assertions from customers and suppliers in connection with the grounding. Asa
 result of the grounding, we reduced the 737 production rate from 52 per month to 42 per month in 2019 and in December 2019, we announcedplans
 to temporarily suspend 737 production beginning in January 2020. We have concluded that the suspension of production and the gradualresumption
 of  production  at  low  production  rates  will  result  in  abnormal  production  costs  which  will  be  expensed  when  incurred  rather  thaninventoried. Prior to the grounding, we had pl
anned to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019.In
 the preparation of our financial statements,  we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other governmentinquiries,
 timing and conditions of return to service, the duration of the 737 MAX production suspension and timing of future 737 production rateincreases,
 supplier  readiness  to  support  production  rate  changes,  timing  and  sequence  of  future  customer  deliveries  as  well  as  outcomes  ofnegotiations
 with  customers  impacted  by  the  grounding.  We  have  also  made  significant  assumptions  regarding  estimated  costs  expected  to  beincurred
 in  2020  and  2021  that  should  be  included  in  program  inventory  and  those  costs  that  should  be  expensed  when  incurred  as  abnormalproduction
 costs.  While  these  assumptions  reflect  our  best  estimate  at  this  time,  they  are  highly  uncertain  and  significantly  affect  the  estimatesinherent in our financial statements.
The
 FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX return to service in each relevantjurisdiction.
 We have assumed that regulatory approval of the 737 MAX will enable deliveries to resume during mid-2020. We have also assumedthat,
 as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737 MAX pilots to undergo computer and simulator training. We  have assumed thatwe
 will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood, and then weexpect
 to  gradually  increase  to  previously  planned  production  rates  over  the  next  few  years. We  are  also  assuming  that  737  MAX  airplanesproduced
 during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them delivering during thefirst
 year after the resumption of deliveries. The cumulative impacts of changes to assumptions regarding timing of return to service and timing ofplanned
 production rates have increased the estimated costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity by approximately $6.3billion,
 which will be recorded in program inventory. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and lower production rates is expected toresult in
 approximately $4.0 billion of abnormal production costs in 2020 and 2021 that will be expensed as incurred. The increases in the estimatedcosts
 accounted for as program inventory will reduce 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins in future periods after deliveriesresume.
 Production costs incurred while production is suspended and a portion of production costs incurred while we gradually increase productionrates
 to a normal level will be expensed as incurred as abnormal costs and will not be included in program inventory. We may face additional costs,delays
 in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX and/or the resumption of deliveries, and/or further delays in planned production rate increases whichmay result in further increases in program costs and/or abnormal production costs.
We
 recorded an earnings charge and corresponding liability of $6.1 billion, in the second quarter of 2019, in connection with an estimate of potentialconcessions
 and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. The secondquarter
 estimate of $6.1 billion was updated in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The remaining liability of $7.4  billion at  December 31, 2019represents
 our current best estimate of future concessions and other considerations we expect to provide to customers. This estimate relies on theexercise of judgment by management and is signific
antly impacted by the assumptions described above, as well as the status of negotiations with46

Table of Contentsour
 customers.  Any  delays  in  our  ability  to  resume  deliveries,  prolonged  production  suspension,  further  disruptions  to  our  production  system,supplier
 claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated  concessions  and  other  considerations  we  expect  to  provide  to  customers  could  have  amaterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operatio
ns, and/or cash flows.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
ImpairmentsWe
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. Ifwe
 determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-stepimpairment
 process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, wefirst
 compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, asecond
 step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fairvalue
 of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwillimpairment.
We
 estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate offuture
 sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements andgeneral market conditions. Changes in thes
e forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The
 cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at thedate of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
We completed
 our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2019  and determined  that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2019 , we estimated that the fair value of
 each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases inthe
 value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairmentcharges in future periods.
As
 of  December  31,  2018,  we  had $490  million of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  related  to  the  Jeppesen  and  Aviall  brand  and  trade  namesacquired
 in business combinations. During 2019, we changed the name of the Aviall business to Boeing Distribution Inc. and, in the fourth quarter,decided
 to retire the  Aviall brand and trade name.  As a result we recorded an earnings charge of $293 million  to  write-off the Aviall indefinite-livedintangible
 asset. Accordingly, as of December  31, 2019,  we had an indefinite-lived intangible asset with a carrying value of $197 million  related  tothe Jeppesen brand and trade name.
We
 test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brandand trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounte
d cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease inthe discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying va
lue of the Jeppesen indefinite-lived intangible asset.47

Table of ContentsPension Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  anannual measurement of
 our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discountrate
 and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes cansignificantly affect our future annual expense, projecte
d benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The
 following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as ofDecember 31, 2019

 cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expectedlong-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 
2019  net periodic pension cost by $149 million . Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We
 have  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,  principally  fixed-rate  debt  obligations,  and  customer  financing  assets  andliabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or
 losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.As
 of December  31, 2019,  the  impact  over  the  next  12  months  of  a  100  basis  point  rise  in  interest  rates  to  our  pre-tax  earnings  would  not  besignificant.
 The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity.Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2019,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $226 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.48

Table of ContentsCommodity Price Risk
We
 are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in themarket
 price.  We  use  commodity  swaps  to  hedge  against  these  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes.  Our  commodity  purchase  contracts  andderivatives
 are  both  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  market  price.  At December  31,  2019,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  market  price  in  ourcommodity
 derivatives  would  have  increased  or  decreased  our  unrealized  losses  by  $63  million.  Consistent  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  toneutralize
 the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, inthe
 remeasurement  of  the  underlying  transactions  being  hedged.  When  taken  together,  these  commodity  purchase  contracts  and  the  offsettingswaps do not create material market risk.

Note 
1  – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,”
 “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions  have been eliminated. As described in Note 23 , weoperate
 in four  reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital(BCC).
 Effective  at the beginning of 2019, all revenues  and costs associated  with military  derivative  aircraft  production  are reported  in the BDSsegment. Amounts in prior periods have been reclassifi
ed to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements  in conformity  with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles  (GAAP) requires  management to makeestimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe
 financial statements  and the reported amounts  of revenues  and expenses during the reporting  period. Actual results  could differ  from thoseestimates.
Operating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year
. Standards Issued and Implemented
In
 the first quarter of 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and recognized on our ConsolidatedStatement
 of Financial Position $1,064  of lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases. Our accounting for financeleases
 and  lessor  contracts  remains  substantially  unchanged.  The  standard  has  no  impact  to  cash  provided  or  used  by  operating,  investing,  orfinancing
 activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As permitted under the standard, we elected prospective application of the newguidance
 and prior periods continue to be presented in accordance with Topic 840. We also elected the package of practical expedients, whichamong other things, does not require reassessment of lease classific
ation. See Note 9  and 13  for additional disclosures.In
 the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), using the modified retrospective method. The standardrefines and
 simplifies hedge accounting requirements for both financial and commodity risks. The impact of the adoption was not material. See Note20
 for additional disclosures.57

Table of ContentsRevenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial
 aircraft contracts The  majority of our BCA  segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contracts. For each contract, wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraftperformance
 obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.Revenue
 is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by thecustomer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
In
 certain situations, where an aircraft  is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  (known as a bill-and-holdarrangement), revenue will be recognized w
hen all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includ
es a deposit upon order andadditional
 payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances andprogress
 billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financingcomponent as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately compl
ete some or all of its obligations under the contract.Long-term contracts
 Substantially  all contracts at BDS  and certain contracts at BGS  are  long-term contracts with the U.S. government and othercustomers
 that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurityproducts,
 surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems,  and  modification  of  commercialpassenger
 aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associatedwith our commercial and defense products and space travel o
n Commercial Crew.For
 each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transactionprice
 to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standaloneselling
 prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelatednature
 of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term
 contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  notinclude
 potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition forthe
 additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costsincurred
 plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration,such
 as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value,based on a weighted probab
ility, or the most likely amount.Long-term contract revenue is
 recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as servicesare
 rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to thecustomer.
 For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow thecustomer
 to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work inprocess.
 Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractualtermination
58

Table of Contentsclauses
 or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have analternative use to the Company.
The
 accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales,  costs and profit for each performance obligation.Cost of
 sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit tothe
 amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales. Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-termcontract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.
Changes
 in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustmentwhich recognizes in the current period the cumulativ
e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion.
 When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forwardloss on the long-term contract is recognized.
Net
 cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses, across all long-term contractswere as follows:
 
2019  2018  2017 Increase to Revenue
$54  $137  $559 (Decrease)/increase to (Loss)/earnings from Operations
($111 )  ($190 )  $250 (Decrease)/increase to Diluted EPS
($0.06 )  ($0.29 )  $0.34 Signific
ant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2019  included reach-forward losses of $148 , $736 and $445  on KC-46A Tanker recorded during 2019, 2018, and 20
17, as well as reach-forward losses on Commercial Crew of $489  during 2019. Due
 to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process,  changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  orcircumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future perio
ds.Payments
 under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholdspayment
 of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables(contract
 assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances andprogress
 billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company inthe event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial
 spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fairvalue.
 We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  partperformance obligation at
 the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare partwhere
 a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination ofthese
 items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded ataverage cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.
Other service revenue contracts
 Certain contracts  at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,training,
 data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the servicesare rendered.

Table of ContentsThe
 method  of  measuring  progress  (such  as  straight-line  or  billable  amount)  varies  depending  upon  which  method  best  depicts  the  transfer  ofcontrol to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.
Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessionsincurred
 may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s pro
ducts or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.Unbilled
 Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled  receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenuefor amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of
 the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise whenthe Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress
billings is determined for each contract
. Financial
 Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notesreceivable.
Lease
 and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/financeleases,
 we record financing receivables at lease inception. A financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments,estimated residual value of the
 leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life ofthe lease to approximate a
 level rate of return on the net investment. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the datefull
 recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current andperformance
 is  demonstrated  by  the  customer.  Residual  values,  which  are  reviewed  periodically,  represent  the  estimated  amount  we  expect  toreceive at
 lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declinesin estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recog
nized in the period in which the declines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimatedresidual
 value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.For
 notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortizationof any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $151 , $145
 and $141  during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$150
, $136 and $144  during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively known as fleet support, these activities a
nd support services60

Table of Contentsinclude
 flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity beginsprior to aircraft delivery as
 the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’soperational
 life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues broughtforth
 by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’sfleet.
 Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. Thecosts for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.
Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment produ
cts and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.Costs
 that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with ourcontract
 accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  anddevelopment
 accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expenserather
 than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $214 , $234 and $288  in 2019, 2018 and 2017
, respectively. Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon
 the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensationexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.Income Taxes
Provisions
 for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported (Loss)/earnings before income taxes based oncurrent
 tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determiningdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income andexpense
 are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required indetermining income tax provisions and eva
luating tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).
Postretirement Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
 company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also providepostretirement
61

Table of Contentsbenefit
 plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under thepension
 and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefitsare
 also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using theprojected unit credit method and several actuarial ass
umptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return,and
 medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  the  service  cost  component  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirementincome
 or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected ininventory
 at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, arereflected
 in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities weamortize
 them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected onthe Consolidated Statements of Financia
l Position.Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.Environmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations,
 and commitments  for remediation  of contaminated  sites,  including assessments  of ranges and probabilities of recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased
 on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  beincurred.
 Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may beable
 to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere 
$101  and $127  at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plantservices, not in excess of
 estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixedcosts
 not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costsinclude amounts relating to programs and contracts with lon
g-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one62

Table of Contentsyear. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocati
on of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.The
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.Used
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  notmaterialize or we determine the costs are no longer probabl
e of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciated principally over the following estimated
 useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10  to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment, fro
m 4  to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150%63

Table of Contentsdeclining
 balance;  and  machinery  and  equipment,  sum-of-the-years’  digits.  Capitalized  internal  use  software  is  included  in  Other  assets  andamortized using the straight line
 method over 5  years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straightline
 method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 10  years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness ofremaining depreciable liv
es assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Leases 
We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  at  the  inception  date.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  Other  assets,  with  therelated
 liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under  finance  leases,  which  primarily  represent  computerequipme
nt, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-termdebt and Long-term debt on the Consolidate
d Statements of Financial Position.Operating
 lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make leasepayments
 arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimatedpresent
 value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of leasepayments.
 Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities, and maintenance costs are expensed asincurred
 and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonablycertain that we will exercise that option. Lease expe
nse is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We have lease agreements with lease and n
on-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.Asset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.We
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly,
 these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded inthe
 period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’sfair
 value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certainbuildings
 but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been includedin the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
64

Table of ContentsWe
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the relatedoperations,
 the  two-step  impairment  process  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  two-stepimpairment
 process  is  used,  we  first  compare  the  carrying  value  of  net  assets  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related  operations.  If  the  fair  value  isdetermined
 to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value forgoodwill
 is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value belowcarrying value represents the amount of goodwill imp
airment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  brand  and  trade  names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  bycomparing
 their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying valueover the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.
Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 
2  to 14 years; product know-how, from 6  to 30 years; customer base, from 3  to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3  to 27 years; and other, from1
 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows ofthe asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-saledebt
 securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.Available-for-sale debt securities are assesse
d for impairment quarterly.The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20%
 and 50% . The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.Other
 Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable
 fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
We
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss onthe disposition of these
 investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic
 purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments orgain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.65

Table of ContentsDerivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes infair
 value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in theperiod of
 change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is toinclude
 in  earnings  the  extent  to  which  the  hedge  is  not  effective  in  achieving  offsetting  changes  in  fair  value.  For  our  cash  flow  hedges,  thederivative’s
 gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periodsduring
 which  the  hedged  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-termstrategic
 sourcing  objectives  and  international  business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  notdesignated
 for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedgeaccounting
 treatment.  For  these  aluminum  agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  thechanges in their fair value are recorded in earni
ngs immediately.Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally  10 to 15 years after  delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement
 for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchasecommitment would become a
 trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.66

Table of ContentsUsed aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases are treated as receivables, and allo
wances for losses are established as necessary.We
 assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateralunderlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are l
ess than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fairvalues
 of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowancefor losses on receivables.
We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease
 We  evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods
 in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic lifeof the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
When
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for losses on customer financing receivables We  record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuationaccount,
 the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to twocomponents of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluate
d individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.We
 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original contractual terms  of  the  receivable agreement,  without regard  to  any  subsequent restructurings.  Factors  considered inassessing
 collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Wedetermine
 a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of therelated collateral we would exp
ect to realize.We
 review the adequacy of the allowance attributable  to the remaining receivables (after  excluding receivables subject to a specific impairmentallowa
nce) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is theexcess
 of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of thecarrying
 value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customercredit ratings and weighted average remain
ing contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for67

Table of Contentseach customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated base
d upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer
 credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraftvalue
 publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actualresults
 will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowancefor losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and
 design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3  to 4-year
 standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards underour
 authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond thestandard
 warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warrantiesissued
 by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons systems. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month
 to two -year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  to  certain  contractualspecifications.
 Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warrantyliabil
ity recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered timesthe
 average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claimslevel. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are cons
idered changes to the initial liability estimate.We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.68

Table of ContentsGuarantees
We record a
 liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For credit guarantees,the
 liability  is  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  expected  loss.  We  determine  the  expected  loss  by  multiplying  the  creditor’s  default  rate  by  theguarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,
 if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of aguarantee,
 we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guaranteeas described above or (b) the probable conting
ent loss amount.Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standar
ds Board issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standardis effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under current
GAAP
 with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires the use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accountsreceivab
les, loans, and other financial instruments. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustmentto retained earnings as
 of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We plan to adopt the new credit loss standardeffective
 January 1, 2020. We do not expect the new credit loss standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations orcash flows.

2  – Acquisitions and Joint VenturesStrategic Partnership with Embraer
During
 the  first  quarter  of  2019,  we  entered  into  definitive  transaction  documents  with  respect  to  a  strategic  partnership  with  Embraer  S.A.(Embraer).
 The partnership contemplates that the parties enter into a joint venture comprising the commercial aircraft and services operations ofEmbraer,
 in which Boeing will acquire an 80 percent  ownership  stake for $4,200 ,  as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets forthe multi-mission, medium airlift C-390 Millennium, in which B
oeing will hold a 49 percent  ownership stake. Embraer
 shareholders approved the transaction,  which remains subject  to regulatory  approvals and other  customary  closing conditions. We areactively
 engaged with the European Commission and have obtained unconditional clearance to close in all other required jurisdictions, including theUnited States, China,
 and Japan. In Brazil, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE)’s General-Superintendence (SG) has providedunconditional
 approval; the decision will become final in mid-February unless a review is requested by CADE Commissioners. We continue to beengaged
 with the European Commission as it progresses its Phase II investigation of the transaction. Pending timely resolution of the remainingregulatory
 approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2020. If the transaction is not completed due to failure to obtain antitrustapprovals, we would be required to pay a terminati
on fee of $100 . 69

4  – Earnings Per ShareBasic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.

 In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $371  related  to the settlement of state tax audits spanning 15 tax years. In the thirdquarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of 
$412  related to the settlement of the 2013-2014 federal tax audit. (2)
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among otherthings,
 lowering the rate from 35%  to 21% effective  January  1,  2018, implementing  a territorial  tax system  and imposing  a one-time  tax ondeemed
 repatriated  earnings  of  non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  The  TCJA  also  enacted  provisions  which  effectively  apply  a  lower  U.S.  tax  rate  tointangible
 income  derived  from  serving  non-U.S.  markets.  In  2019  and  2018,  we  recorded  tax  benefits  related  to  foreign  derived  intangibleincome of 
$229  and $549 . (3)
 In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $180 , $181 and $207 , respectively. (4)
 In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the fourth quarter of 2017, werecorded
 provisional tax benefits of $1,430  related  to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in thecorporate
 tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $159  related  to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarterof
 2018 and in accordance with SAB 118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017and recorded an incremental benefit related to refineme
nts to these provisional amounts which was not significant.74

The
 TCJA one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferredfrom
 U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries becausesuch
 earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  If  such  earnings  were  to  be  distributed,  any  foreign  withholding  tax  would  not  besignificant.
As of 
December 31,  2019 and 2018,  the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the ConsolidatedStatements
 of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  notsignificant for the

, $1,405 and $1,568  would  affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2019 ,  these amounts are primarily associated withthe amount of research tax credits claimed, uncertainties in the TCJA, tax basis adjustments and the U.S. manufacturi
ng activity tax benefit.Federal income tax audits have been settled for all ye
ars prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2015-2017 federal tax audit inthe
 first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2007-2018 tax years. We believeappropriate provisions for all outstandin

 outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 monthsunrecognized tax benefits related to federal matters under aud

8  – Contracts with CustomersUnbilled
 receivables decreased  from $10,025  at December 31, 2018 to $9,043 at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by timing of billings at BDSand BGS.
Advances
 and progress billings increased  from $50,676  at December 31, 2018 to $51,551 at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by advances onorders received in excess of revenue recognized at BD
S, BGS, and BCA. Revenues recognized for the years ended 
December 31, 2019 and 2018  from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the be ginningof each year were 
$16,778  and $24,737 . Certain
 commercial airplane customers are experiencing liquidity issues and seeking additional capital. Should these customers fail to address theirliquidity
 issues,  accounts  receivable,  unbilled  receivables  and  certain  inventory  could  become  impaired.  In  addition  we  would  have  to  removecontracts related to these customers from backlog and remarket any undelivered aircraft.
The
 following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December31:

 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original  contractual  terms.  At December  31,  2019 and 2018 ,  we  individually  evaluated  for  impairment  customer  financingreceivables
 of $400  and $409 ,  of which $388  and $398  were  determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impairedreceivables as the collateral values exc
eeded the carrying values of the receivables.Income
 recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Incomeis
 recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. The average recordedinvestment in impaired financing receiva
bles for the year ended December 31, 2019  was $392 , and the related interest income was insignificant. The change in the allowance for losses on financi

 adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customerfinancing
 receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates  and  collateral  values.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  anddetermine
 the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers.Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agenc
ies.79

0.6%, respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivabl es.Customer Financing Exposure
Customer
 financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance andoverall
 market  conditions  and  may  be  subject  to  reduced  valuation  with  market  decline.  Declines  in  collateral  values  could  result  in  assetimpairments,
 reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experience
d greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the fol

 partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia) – $111 ,  PO Yuzhnoye MashinostroitelnyZavod of Ukraine – 
$89  and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44 .In
 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launchpartners.
 In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, wereached
 an  agreement  which  we  believe  will  enable  us  to  recover  the  outstanding  receivable  balance  from  RSC  Energia  over  the  next  severalyears.
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the U.S. District Court. We continue topursue
 collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believe the partners have thefinancial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of
 our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement fromRSC Energia and the Ukrainia
n Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges.82

On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft
 operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries ofthe
 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. In addition, multiple legal actions have beenfiled
 against us as a result of the accidents. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737MAX
 program, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonablyestimate
 a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these law suits, investigations andinquiries.
We
 have developed software and pilot training updates for the 737 MAX and continue to work with the FAA and non-U.S. civil aviation authorities tocomplete
 remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service including addressing their questions on the software updates andhow pilots will interact with the airplane controls and displ
ays in different flight scenarios. We have assumed that computer and simulator training willbe required and as a result, we have provision
ed for certain training costs.84

Table of ContentsPrior
 to the grounding, the 737 production rate was 52 per month and we had planned to increase the rate to 57 per month during 2019. Beginningin
 the second quarter of 2019, we reduced the production rate to 42 per month. We have continued to produce at a rate of 42 per month throughDecember
 2019, which has resulted in approximately 400 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2019. In December 2019, we announced thetemporary
 suspension of 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020 due to a number of factors, including the 737 MAX grounding continuinglonger
 than expected, our decision to prioritize delivery of stored aircraft, and uncertainty about the timing and conditions of return to service andglobal training approvals. 
We  have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of returnto
 service are better understood, and then we expect to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years. We have assumed
 that regulatory approval will enable 737 MAX deliveries to resume during mid-2020. The cumulative impacts of changes to assumptionsregarding timing of return to service and timing of planned prod
uction rates and deliveries have increased the estimated costs to produce and deliveraircraft included in the current accounting quantity by ap
proximately $6,300 , which will be recorded in program inventory. This wil l result in lower 737program
 margins in future periods after deliveries resume. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and abnormally low production ratesonce production resumes will result in approx
imately $4,000  of abnormal production costs during 2020 and 2 021 that will be expensed as incurred.We
 are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. During the second quarter of2019,
 we  recorded  an  earnings  charge  (reduction  in  revenue)  and  a  corresponding  liability  of $6,110  in  connection  with  estimated  potentialconcessions
 and  other  considerations  to  customers  for  disruptions  related  to  the  737  MAX  grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays.  We  haveinsurance
 coverage for up to $500  of  costs arising due to grounded aircraft and have received $500  from  our insurance carriers, which partiallyoffset
 the earnings charges. We continue to reassess the liability for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers on aquarterly
 basis, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, we recorded additional charges totaling $2,649 .  This reassessment includes updatingestimates
 to  reflect  revised  return  to  service  and  updated  delivery  and  production  rate  assumptions,  as  well  as  latest  information  based  onengagements
 with  737  MAX  customers.  The  liability  represents  our  current  best  estimate  of  future  concessions  and  other  considerations  tocustomers, and is necessarily based on a series of assumptions.
The following table summarizes chang
es in the 737 MAX customer concessions and other considerations liability during 2019.

 have also recorded additional expenses of $328  as  a result of the 737 MAX grounding. These expenses include costs related to storage, pilottraining and software updates.
The
 FAA  and  other  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  will  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  of  return  to  service.  Our  assumptions  reflect  ourcurrent
 best estimate, but actual timing and conditions of return to service and resumption of deliveries could differ from this estimate, the effect ofwhich could be
 material. We are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, dueto continued uncertainties related to
 the timing and conditions of return to service, future changes to the production rate, supply chain impacts or theresults of
 negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a material adverse effect onour

l position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveriesconsistent with our assumptions, the continue
d absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with 737 MAX deliveries would continue tohave
 the most material impact on our operating results. In the event that future production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer thanwe are currently assuming we
 expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However,while
 any  prolonged  production  suspension  or  delays  in  planned  production  rate  increases  could  mitigate  the  impact  on  our  liquidity  it  couldsignificantly
 increase the overall expected costs to produce aircraft included in the accounting quantity, which would reduce 737 program marginsand/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.
737NG Structure (Pickle Fork)
During
 the third quarter of 2019, we detected cracks in the "pickle forks," a component of the structure connecting the wings to the fuselages, ofthree 737-800NGs we were converting into
 freighters. We notified the FAA, which issued a directive requiring that 737NG airplanes with over 30,000flight
 cycles be inspected for this condition by October 10, 2019, and that airplanes with over 22,600 flight cycles be inspected over the next 1,000flight
 cycles. To date, all airplanes with over 30,000 flight cycles and approximately half of the airplanes with over 22,600 flights cycles have beeninspected
 and this condition has been found on a small percentage of aircraft, and those aircraft will be repaired. A small percentage of airplaneswith
 fewer than 22,600 flight cycles have also been inspected. We have estimated the number of aircraft that will have to be repaired in the futureand
 provisioned for the estimated costs of completing the repairs. We recognized charges of $135  in  2019 for current and projected future aircraftrepairs.
 However, we cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature ofthe inspections and repairs and pen
ding the completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.Environmental

In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers
 that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-incommitments
 will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from othersources.
 The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic andairline
 industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only duringthe period specified in the agreement, and requ
ire advance notice by the customer.Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December  31, 2019 have  expiration dates from 2020  through 2026 .  At December 31, 2019 and 2018,  totalcontractual
 trade-in commitments were $1,407  and $1,519 .  As of December  31, 2019 and 2018,  we estimated that it was probable we would beobligated
 to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling $711  and $522  and  the fair value of therelated trade-in aircraft was

. United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the Budget Control Act limits on federal discretionary defense and non-defense spending for fiscal years2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty and the risk of
 sequestration. The consolidated appropriations acts for FY20, enactedin
 December 2019, provided FY20 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including the United States Department of Defense(U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space A
dministration (NASA) and the FAA.The
 enacted FY20 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64Apache,
 V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to futureprogram-level
 appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,including
 changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existingcontracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial positi
on and/or cash flows.BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price
 development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete thework.
 BDS  fixed-price  contracts  with  significant  development  work  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk  (formerly  T-XTrainer),
 VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contractscreate
 financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost andrevenue estimates
 could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded reach-forward lossesof 
$148 on  KC-46A Tanker and $489  on  Commercial Crew in 2019. Moreover, our fixed-price development programs remain subject to additionalreach-forward losses if we experience further production, technica
l or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. 88

Table of ContentsKC-46A Tanker
In
 2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerialrefueling
 tankers.  This  EMD  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  and  involves  highly  complex  designs  and  systems  integration.  Since2016,
 the USAF has authorized five low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 67 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots arevalued at approximately 
$15 billion . At 
December 31, 2019, we had approximately $331  of capitalized precontract costs and $225  of potential termination liabilities to supp liers.Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor
 amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or providerefunds to the U.S. government.

 to  ULA In  2006,  we  agreed  to  indemnify  ULA  through  December  31,  2020  against  potential  non-recoverability  and  non-allowability
 of $1,360  of  Boeing  Delta  launch  program  inventory  included  in  contributed  assets  plus $1,860  of  inventory  subject  to  an  inventorysupply agreement which ends on 
March 31, 2021 . See Note 7 . ULA has yet to consume $30  of contributed inventory.89

Table of ContentsIn
 June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271  of  deferred support costs are notrecoverable
 under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114  of deferred
 production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAFfor collection of deferred support
 and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeingand
 ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support andproduction
 costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred supportcost
 invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. Theparties
 have since agreed to engage in alternative dispute resolution, and the court has stayed the litigation pending that process. If, contrary to ourbelief, it is determined that some or all of the
 deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax lossesup to 
$269  and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317  of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications
 In  conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourBCA
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relatingto pre-closing environm
ental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be assertedunder
 these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder these
 indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or areprobable and reasonably estima
ble, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14 .Credit Guarantees
 We have issued c redit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the originallessee
 or  debtor  does not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have been extended  on behalf  ofguaranteed
 parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expirethrough 
2036 . Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial
 Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property atour
 St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.We
 record  these  properties  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  We  have  also  purchased  the  IRBs  and  therefore  are  thebondholders
 as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and arereported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financ

17  – Postretirement PlansThe
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees transitioned to company-funded d
efined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are pl
aced in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately two-thirds of those participants who are elig
ible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including92

 covered  by  most  United  Auto  Workers  bargaining  agreements,  are  provided  lifetime  health  care  coverage.  The  funded  status  of  theplans
 is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  plan  assets  at  fair  value  and  the  projected  benefit  obligation  (PBO).  We  have  recognized  theaggregate
 of  all overfunded  plans in Other  assets,  and the  aggregate  of all underfunded  plans in either  Accrued  retiree  health care  or Accruedpension

The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31,
2019  2018  2017 Discount rate:
        Pension
3.30 % 4.20 % 3.60 %Other postretirement benefits

4.30 % 5.30 % 5.30 %Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans
5.15 % 5.15 % 5.15 %The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The presentvalue of each plan’s benefits is calcu
lated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,the
 assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for theupcoming
 plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).Since
 our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of planassets. As of 
December 31, 2019 , the MRVA was approximately $3,674  less than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:

Table of ContentsPlan Assets
Investment Strategy
 The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investmentbenchmarks
 to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced periodical
ly. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: 
Actual Allocations   Target Allocations Asset Class

 income  securities  are  invested  primarily  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long  duration  instruments.  Global  equity  securities  are  invested  in  adiversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various i
ndustries and market capitalizations.Private
 equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capitaland
 special situation strategies. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limitedpartnershi
p (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate).Real estate includes, but is
 not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to,investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.
Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relativ
e value, long-short and multi-strategy.Investment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired
 market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currencyexposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalanc
e the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.96

Table of ContentsAs
 a  percentage  of  total  pension  assets,  derivative  net  notional  amounts  were 4.3%  and 4.4%  for  fixed  income,  including  to-be-announcedmortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 
3.6%  and 5.5%  for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Risk Management
 In  managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing. 97

Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements
 The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,  2019 and 2018. The fair value
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3includes fair values estimated using sig
nificant unobservable inputs.

Table of ContentsFixed
 income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  othersecurities
 for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single presentvalue amount. Inputs used in developi
ng fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at  their  net  asset  values  (NAVs)  that  are  calculated  by  theinvestment
 manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and areprimarily
 valued using an income  approach  with  inputs  that  include benchmark  yields,  swap curves,  cash  flow  analysis,  rating  agency  data  andinterdealer
 broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settleddaily and therefore reflected in the payables a
nd receivables portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discountedfuture
 cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis(primarily
 LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valuedusing
 a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  incomevaluation methodology dep
ending on the specific type of security or instrument held.Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner(GP),
 fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles andare
 valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments asthe practical expedient for the valuations.

Certain

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby 
ERISA,  and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc
e benefit programs.Should
 we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will beentitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets base
d on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was 
$1,533 , $1,480 and $1,522  in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Note

Our
 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,restricted
 stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards toour
 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 
87,000,000 . Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during

In
 February 2019,  2018 and 2017,  we granted to our executives 233,582 , 260,730 and 523,835  restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of 
$428.22 , $361.13 and $178.72  per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and
 settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment becauseof
 retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employmentduring
 the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUsawarded
 under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward variousachievements.
 These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high andlow stock prices on the date of grant.

Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared toa
 group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0%  to 200% of  the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted inFebruary
 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400%  of  the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this programwill
 vest  at  the  payout  amount  and  settle  in  common  stock  (on  a  one-for-one  basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  executiveterminates employment because
 of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the awardand,
 if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all othercases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.
In February 
2019, 2018 and 2017 , we granted to our executives 214,651 , 241,284 and 492,273  PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is

Performance Awards
Performance
 Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unithas
 an initial value of $100  dollars.  The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0  to $200 dollars per
 unit, depending on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to paythese
 awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimatedperformance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.
During 
2019, 2018 and 2017 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout bas edon the achievement of financial goals for each three-ye
ar period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0  and the maximumamount we could be required to pay out for the

2, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), in the first quarter of 2019. Prior period amounts have not been restated.
Cash Flow Hedges
Our
 cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currencyforward
 contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreigncurrencies.
 Our  foreign  currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through 2025 .  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-pricepurchase
 commitments and swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contractshedge forecasted transactions through 
2023 . Fair Value Hedges
Interest
 rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change infair
 value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. As of December  31, 2019,  there are no fair valuehedges reported on the Consolid
ated Statements of Financial Position.106

21  – Fair Value MeasurementsThe
 fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determinedbased
 on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated
 using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measuredat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized usi

 market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted marketprices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable i
nstruments.Derivatives
 include foreign  currency,  commodity  and interest  rate  contracts.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are valued using an incomeapproach
 based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valuedusing
 an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Thefair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analys
is based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.Certain
 assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  tablepresents
 the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and assetclassification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

Table of ContentsInvestments,
 Acquired  intangible  assets  and  Property,  plant  and  equipment  were  primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  based  on  thediscounted
 cash flows  associated  with  the underlying  assets.  The fair  value of  the  impaired  customer  financing assets  includes operating  leaseequipment
 and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases, and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group ofthird
 party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market tradesand
 other market  factors.  Management  reviews  the publications  quarterly  to assess the continued appropriateness  and consistency  with markettrends.
 Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when thefeatures
 or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected netsales price for the aircraft.
For
 Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2019 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques a
nd related unobservable inputs of those assets.

Table of ContentsThe fair values of
 notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar termsto borrowers of similar credit quality. The
 fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on currentmarket yields. For
 our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowingcost
 derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flowmodels
 using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable toestimate
 the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain.Items not
 included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,Accounts
 receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, asreflected in
 the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carryin
g value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).Note 
22  – Legal ProceedingsVarious legal proceedin
gs, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.In
 addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings couldresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings inv
olve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and trebledamages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
 Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can alsobe
 suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based uponcurrent
 information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect onour
 financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts inconnection
 with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of suchamounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimate
d, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.Multiple legal actions
 have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accidentof Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further,
 we are subject to ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidentsand
 the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonablyestimate
 a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these lawsuits, investigations, andinquiries.
Note 
23  – Segment and Revenue InformationEffective
 at the beginning of 2019, all revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.Revenues
 and  costs  associated  with  military  derivative  aircraft  production  were  previously  reported  in  the  BCA  and  BDS  segments.  Businesssegment
 data for 2018 and 2017 reflects the realignment for military derivative aircraft, as well as the realignment of certain programs from BDS toBGS.
Our
 primary profitability measurements to review a segment’s operating results are Earnings from operations and operating margins. We operate infour
 reportable segments: BCA , BDS, BGS,  and BCC .  All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 56  for theSummary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.

BLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boein
g CompanyOpinion on the Financial Statements
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as ofDecember
 31, 2019 and 2018 ,  the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of thethree
 years in the period ended December 31, 2019 ,  and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, thefinancia
l statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the results of
 its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December  31, 2019,  in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States of America.
We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theCompany's internal control over financia
l reporting as ofDecember
 31,  2019,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  SponsoringOrganizations
 of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January  31, 2020,  expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These
 financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company'sfinancial
 statements  based on our audits.  We are a public accounting  firm  registered  with the PCAOB and are required  to be independent withrespect to
 the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits includedperforming
 procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performingprocedures
 that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures inthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluati
ng the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as wellas evaluating the overall presentatio
n of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financia
l statements and(2)
 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way ouropinion
 on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separateopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to wh
ich they relate.118

Table of ContentsCost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As
 more  fully  described  in  Notes  1  and  14  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  long-termcontracts as
 goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenueis
 recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involvesestimating
 the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount.Fixed-pric
e development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contractsare
 subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes to cost estimates couldoccur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.
Given the
 complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United StatesAir
 Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft,  MQ-25 Stingray, and T-7A Red Hawk contracts,  the limited amount of historical data available in certaininstances
 and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and ahigh degree of auditor judgment and req
uired audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for fixed-price development contracts incl
uded the following, among others:•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions in developing its estimates.•
We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts and observed the work site toevaluate project status and project challen
ges which may affect total estimated costs to complete.•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing the estimates. We developed independent expectations of likelyoutcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to mana
gement’s estimates.•
We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation ofsuch data, and management’s judgment regardi
ng the range of possible outcomes relating to the specific estimates.•
We  performed  retrospective  reviews,  comparing  actual  performance  to  estimated  performance,  when  evaluating  the  thoroughness  andprecision of management’s estimation process.
Program Accounting Estimates for New Programs - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The
 introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification and production schedules. TheCompany uses program accounti
ng in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accountingrequires
 estimating  and  demonstrating  customer  demand  for  the  number  of  units  included  in  the  program  (program  accounting  quantity)  andestimating
 the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and revenuefor
 unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of possible outcomes. Changes torevenue or

Table of Contentsprogram
 accounting  quantity  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  Auditing  the  estimated  marketdemand
 and revenue for unsold units for the 777X program involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with industry and quantitativeanalytics experience given the hi
gh degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management’s estimates.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to estimated market demand and reven
ue for unsold units for the 777X included the following, among others:•
We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current salescampaigns, short and long-term market demand, and overall program status.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in developing its estimates related tothe initial program accounting quantity an
d revenue for unsold units.•
We  evaluated  management’s  ability  to  estimate  program  revenue  by  comparison  to  historical  estimates  and  actual  results  on  similarprograms.
•
We  developed  independent  expectations  of  likely  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program’s  data  and  compared  our  expectations  tomanagement’s estimates.
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation ofsuch data, and management’s judgment regardi
ng the range of possible outcomes relating to the specific estimates.Liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding - Refer to Notes 14 and 22 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On March 13,
 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.aircraft
 operators following two fatal accidents of 737 MAX aircraft. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect (the“737
 MAX  Grounding”).  In  addition,  multiple  legal  actions  have  been  filed  against  the  Company  following  the  fatal  accidents  and  variousgovernmental and regulatory investigati
ons and inquiries continue relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX aircraft.During
 2019, the Company recorded a liability in connection with estimated  payments,  concessions and other in-kind consideration it intends toprovide to
 customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX Grounding and associated delivery delays. This liability totaled $7.4 billion at December31,
 2019 and is reflected in the financial statements in Accrued liabilities. This represents the Company’s best estimate of future concessions andother
 consideration to its customers, and is necessarily based on individual negotiations with customers and a series of assumptions, including thetiming
 and conditions of the 737 MAX’s return to service in various jurisdictions and the timing of future production rate increases. Because thetiming
 and conditions of the 737 MAX return to service in various jurisdictions will be determined by civil aviation authorities and is outside of theCompany’s control, the assumptions underlyin
g the liability require a high degree of auditor judgment.Significant judgment is involve
d in management’s ability to assess and reasonably estimate potential additional financial statement effects or a rangeof loss, if any,
 resulting from the outcome of 737 MAX-related litigation and the results of the various governmental and regulatory investigations andinquiries related to the 737 MAX.
120

Table of ContentsThe
 subjectivity of the liability associated with providing consideration to customers resulting from the 737 MAX Grounding and the complexity ofassessing the
 outcome of the ongoing litigation and investigations related to the 737 MAX required a high degree of auditor judgment and increasedaudit effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures associated with li
abilities related to the 737 MAX grounding included the following, among others:•
We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of regulatory approval for returnto service in various jurisdictions and the status of considerati
on discussions with individual customers.•
We obtained written representations from management concerning its intent to provide consideration to customers and the extent of thatconsideration.
•
We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  related  to  nonrecurring  items  and  loss  contingencies  associated  with  litigation,  claims  andassessments.
•
We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, including the timing andconditions of 737 MAX return
 to service, and, where possible, we corroborated the assumptions with management outside of the accountingand finance organizations.
•
We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential consideration as a result of the 737MAX Grounding.
•
We inquired of internal and external legal counsel to understand developments related to contractual obligations to customers, litigation andother claims relating to the 737 MAX Grounding and progress
ion in potential settlement discussions.•
We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss contingencies.•
We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737 MAX Grounding./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

rtingWe
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December  31, 2019,  based oncriteria
 established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission(COSO).
 In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in
 Internal Control - Integrated Frame work (2013) issued by COSO. We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  consolidatedfinancial statements as
 of and for the year ended December 31, 2019  of  the Company, and our report dated January 31, 2020  expressed an unq ualified opinionon those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  ofinternal
 control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility isto
 express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOBand
 are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations ofthe Securities and Excha
nge Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether effective inte
rnal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understandingof
 internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness ofinternal
 control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our auditprovides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade
 only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  ortimely detection of unauthorized a
cquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent li
mitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are sub
ject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP
