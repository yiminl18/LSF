included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.Certain terms used throughout 
this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are a leading globa
l manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded andunbranded food products to the North Ame
rican foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018, we 
are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in13 countries and market th
em in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we hav e 50 percent interests in two strategic jointventures that manufac
ture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.We continue to pursue our Consumer Fi
rst strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across allgeographies through strong innovat
ion, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accel erating growth on our four differentialgrowth platforms, which are 
Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream, snack bars, Old
El
Paso
 Mexican food, and our portfolio o f natural and organic food brands; and 3)reshaping our portfolio through g
rowth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures. We beli eve executing against this growth framework should result in long-term value creat
ion for our shareholders.As part of our 
portfolio shaping strategy, in fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We financed thetransaction with a combin
ation of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. The consolidated results of Blu e Buffalo are reported as ourPet operating segment on a 
one-month lag. In fiscal 2018, our Consolidat ed Statements of Earnings did not include Pet operating segment results. Forfurther information on 
the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.We manage 
and review the financia l results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice;Europe & Australia; Asia & La
tin America; and Pet. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resu lts of Operations(MD&A) in Item 7 of this repor
t for a description of our segments.We offer a variety 
of food products that provide gr eat taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our business is focused onthe following large, global 
categories: 
 
• snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks; 
 
• ready-to-eat cereal;  
 
• convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;  
 
• yogurt; 
 
• pet food; 
3

Table of Contents 
• super-premium ice cream; 
 
• baking mixes and ingredients; and 
 
• refrigerated and frozen dough.Our Cereal Partners Worldwide 
(CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside NorthAmerica, and our 
Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture co mpetes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contribu ted byeach class of simila
r products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Customers. 
Our primary customers ar e grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, e-commerce 
retailers, comme rcial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. Wegenerally sell to thes
e customers through our direct sales fo rce. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain typesof customers. For further in
formation on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial State ments inItem 8 of this report. 
During fiscal 2019, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent ofnet sales of our North Americ
a Retail segment. No other customer a ccounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further informationon significant customers, p
lease refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Competition. 
The packaged foods categori es are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the world. The categories
 in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailerswith their own branded products. Compet
itors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substant
ial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our p roduct categories is based on product innovation, productquality, price, brand re
cognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and theability to identify and s
atisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights,effective custome
r relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation a ligned with consumers’ needs, anefficient supply chain, 
and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regionalbrands and with generic 
and private label product s that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and localmanufacturers, and ea
ch country includes a unique group of competitors.Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. 
The principal raw mate rials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nu
ts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metalpackaging materials, op
erating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian opera tions are purchased from suppliers in theUnited States. In our other int
ernational operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The costof these inputs may 
fluctuate widely due to ex ternal conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations,currency fluctuations, trade
 tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed pricecontracts, but the majo
rity of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs.Occasionally and where possible, we 
make advance purchases of ite ms significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objectiveis to procure materi
als meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent 
the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse pricemovements for some inputs using 
a variety of risk management strategies. We also hav e a grain merchandising operation that provides 
4

Table of Contentsus efficient access 
to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventoriesthat are carried at net realizable value 
and uses derivatives to man age its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our research and developmen
t resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, andexploratory 
research in new business and te chnology areas. Research and development expenditures were $222 million in fiscal 2019 and $219 million infiscal 2018.

arks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are prop erly maintained and they have not been found to havebecome generic. Registr
ations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.Some of our products are mark
eted under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing products (e.g.,Reese’s
Puffs
for cereal, Green
Giant
 for vegetables in cer tain countries, and Cinnabon
 for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) andshorter term promotion
al products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equit ies).Our cereal tradema
rks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé
 trademark. Nestlé licenses cert ain of its trademarks to CPW,including the 
Nestlé

ks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an en tity in which we own a 50 percent interest.We continue our focus on develop
ing and marketing innovative, proprietary p roducts, many of which use proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations.We consider the colle
ctive rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependen
t upon any single patent or group of related patents.SEASONALITY
In general, demand for our p
roducts is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerateddough, 
frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso
 soup is higher during the fall and wintermonths. Internationally, wi
thin 
5

Table of Contentsour Europe & Australia and Asia & L
atin America segments, demand for Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream is higher du ring the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products incre
ases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in thenorthern and southern hemisphe
res, our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly b alanced throughout the year.BACKLOG
Orders are generally f
illed within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as of May 26, 2019, was not material.
WORKING CAPITAL

Our business is subject to various r
isks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financialcondition, and results of oper
ations.The categories in which we participate are ve
ry competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
The consumer and pet food cat
egories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categorie s are manufacturers, as wellas retailers with the
ir own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal compe
titors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product c ategories, we compete not only with otherwidely advertised branded produ
cts, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices.Competition in our product 
categories is based on  
8

Table of Contentsproduct innovation, product qual
ity, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and deliveryto the consumer, and the abi
lity to identify and satisfy consum er preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing orpromotional changes, we could choos
e to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be 
adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful inintroducing innovative produc
ts in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our co mpetitors. If we are unable to buildand sustain brand equity by offe
ring recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private labelproducts.
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the fac
e of a consolidating retail environment.There has been significan
t consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customersmay seek to use their posit
ion to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand nameproducts, increased emphas
is on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketingexpertise, product innovat
ion, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volumegrowth could be negatively 
impacted. In addition, th e loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019, Walmartaccounted for 20 percent o
f our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. PetSmart and Petco a ccounted for36 percent and 14 percent, r
espectively, of our Pet segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic.If national pet supersto
re chains continue to experience red uced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating resultsmay be adversely affe
cted. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of thisreport.
Price changes for the commoditi
es we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials t
hat we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of sup
ply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policiesand regulations. Commodity pri
ce changes may result in unexpected increases in raw mate rial, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increaseproductivity to offset th
ese increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge againstchanges in 
commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.Volatility in the market value of der
ivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity pri ces will cause volatility in our grossmargins and net earnings.
We utilize derivatives to 
manage price risk for so me of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principallysoybean), dairy products, natur
al gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resu lting in volatility inboth gross margin and net earn
ings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocatedcorporate items outsid
e our segment operating results until we utiliz e the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and lossesare reclassified to segment o
perating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
If we are not efficient in our production, our profi
tability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings g
rowth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufactur e of our products in highly competitivemarkets. Gaining additi
onal efficiencies may become more

e. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures couldadversely affect our p
rofitability and weaken our competitive pos ition. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturingfacilities and produc
tion lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodic
ally engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unableto execute those initi
atives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated ben efits, which could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations.
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely 
affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and s
ell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distr ibutioncapabilities due to weather
, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/exportrestrictions, or other factor
s could impair our ability to manufacture or sel l our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location.Our suppliers’ policies and pr
actices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential 
impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a singlesupplier or location, could 
adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require addit ional resources to restore our supply chain.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to 
avoid certain food products or ingredients. We could be adversely affecte
d if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food p roducts or ingredients.Adverse publicity about these 
types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production anddelivery disruptions.
If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabel
ed, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers 
or their pets are injured. We may need to recal
l some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significantlosses due to the costs of a re
call, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could alsosuffer losses from a si
gnificant product liability judgment against us. A signific ant product recall or product liability case could also result in adversepublicity, damage to our r
eputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer prefer
ences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our abi
lity to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appe al totheir preferences 
in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected bya number of different 
trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identi fy or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerginge-commerce 
channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and pro
fitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effectsof ingredients such as sodium, t
rans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, o r other product ingredients or attributes. 
10

Table of ContentsWe may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster g
rowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potentia
l is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the m
arkets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products infaster growing and more prof
itable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to incr ease market share in our existing product categories.If we do not succeed in developing 
innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
The willingness of consumers to pur
chase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers maypurchase 
more generic, privat e label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience areduction in sales of highe
r margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of e conomic conditions orcompetitive actions, we 
may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consumeaway from home at custome
rs that purchase products from our Convenience Stor es & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverseeffect on our results of op
erations.Our results may be negatively impact
ed if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.Maintaining and continual
ly enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based inlarge part on the degre
e to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number offactors, including consume
r perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain thequality of our products, the f
ailure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our productsbecoming unavailable to 
consumers. Consumer demand for our products m ay also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotionalsupport. The use of social and digi
tal media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative pos
ts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands andreputation. If we do not main
tain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be nega tively impacted.Our international operations are subject to pol
itical and economic risks.In fiscal 2019, 26 percent of ou
r consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationa
lly, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 
•
 political and economic instability;•
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;•
 tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;•
 nationalization of operations;•
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations;•
 uncertainty relating to the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union;•
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and•
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.

Table of ContentsOur financial perform
ance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuat ions could cause materialvariations in our results o
f operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chineserenminbi, euro, Japanese yen, M
exican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to t ime, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of ourexposure to currency fluc
tuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could advers
ely affect our business.Our facilities and produc
ts are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food andDrug 
Administration, the Occupat ional Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to theproduction, packaging, label
ling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of ou r employees. Our failure tocomply with such laws and regulat
ions could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls ofour products. We advertise ou
r products and could  be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreignlaws and regulations. We may 
also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on theaudience to whom products are 
marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost ofdoing business or restrict our 
actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.We are subject to var
ious federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws andregulations could su
bject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediationobligations. Due to regulatory 
complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigat ion, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties ofours, the potential exi
sts for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or
 compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect onour business and results of opera
tions.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adverse
ly affect our ability to paydividends.
As of May 26, 2019, we had total debt, redee
mable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $15.4 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us fro
m incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: 
•
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly i f the ratings assigned to ourdebt securities by rat
ing organizations were revised downward; and•
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various finan
cial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of theserequirements, the re
lated indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtainadditional or alternative 
financing may also be adve rsely affected.Our ability to make schedul
ed payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financia l performance, which inturn is subject to prevai
ling economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.

Table of ContentsGlobal capital and credit market issues could negat
ively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.
We depend on stable, liquid, and we
ll-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believ e that our operating cash flows,financial assets, access to
 capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future,there can be no 
assurance that future vo latility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.We also utilize interest rate derivati
ves to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience anincrease in our costs of bor
rowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting fromtighter capital and credit markets 
or a slowdown in the general economy. From time to time, we issue v
ariable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps tha t contain a variableelement based on an IBOR. There is cu
rrently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to beavailable, we may need t
o amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what al ternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties andsecurity holders. A
s a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.Volatility in the securities 
markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirementbenefit, and postemployment benefit costs.
We sponsor a number of defined b
enefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, includ ing defined benefit pension,retiree health and we
lfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in aglobally diversified por
tfolio of securities and other inve stments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,investment returns, and th
e market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net p eriodicbenefit cost and future 
funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negativeimpact on our results of ope
rations and cash flows from operations. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology syste
ms fail to perform adequately or are breached.Information technology se
rves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks andsystems, including the inte
rnet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply withregulatory, legal, and t
ax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to eff ectively manage our key business processesincluding digital mark
eting, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. Thesetechnologies enable int
ernal and external communication among our lo cations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt andstorage of personal infor
mation about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on servic
es provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such ascatastrophic events, na
tural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, sec urity breaches, computer viruses, hackers,employee error or malfeasance, a
nd other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our informationtechnology systems, 
as well as the confidenti ality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technologysystems to perform as we ant
icipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, da ta loss, legal claims orproceedings, regulatory pen
alties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational,reputational, legal, and fi
nancial impacts that may have a material adv erse effect on our business.

Table of ContentsA change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a di
fferent weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangibl
e assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of May 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested forimpairment annually and 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of thereporting unit, including goodwil
l, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reportingunit, including goodwill, impai
rment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for salesand profits are 
determined using inputs fro m our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions,market comparables, 
and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business perform ance and wecontinue to monitor these bus
inesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performanceof our businesses could result in s
ignificant impairment losses. We evaluate the useful lives
 of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue
Buffalo
 , Pillsbury
, Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination on useful life requiressignificant judgments and 
assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability ofthe industry, known 
technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes indistribution channels), th
e level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recover
able. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projectedrevenues from our long-rang
e plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our Pillsbury
 , Yoki
, and 
Progresso
brands have experienced de clining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, ple
ase refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.We may fail to realize all 
of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisi tion or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.Our ability to realize the 
anticipated benefi ts of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which isa complex, costly, and tim
e-consuming process. We had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and ou r lack ofexperience in this sec
tor may hinder our ability to manage Blue Buffalo successfully following the acquisition.The integration process
 may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges 
involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of,or a loss of momentum in, our ope
rations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, the integra
tion of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, compe titive responses, and loss of customersand other business relationsh
ips. Additional integration challenges include: 
 
• diversion of management’s attention to integration matters; 
• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the acquisition;  
14

Table of Contents 
• difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; 
• difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures, and accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structur es; 
• difficulties in the assimilation of employees; 
• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; 
• difficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities; 
• challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; 
• the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and 
• coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.Many of these factors will b
e outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, anddiversion of management
’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in usbecoming subject to lit
igation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipat ed benefits of the acquisition may not berealized, including th
e synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within theanticipated time frame, or at all. 
Further, additional unanti cipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could causereductions in our earnings pe
r share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Blue Buffalo acquisition will r
esult in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.Blue Buffalo may underperform 
relative to our expectations. The business, prospects, and financ
ial performance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We m ay not be able to maintain the growthrate, levels of revenu
e, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Blue Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. Our failure to do so couldhave a material adverse 
effect on our financi al condition and results of operations. When we acquired Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2018, we recorded significantbrand intangible and goodwill ass
ets at fair value based on, among other things, our projections of Blue Buffalo’s financial performance . Our failure to meetor exceed our projection
s could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including a material impairment to ourintangible assets.
Our failure to successfully integ
rate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.From time to time, we eva
luate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon ourability to integrat
e acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additionalpotential risks associa
ted with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers o f the acquired business, theassumption of unknown liabiliti
es, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited priorexperience, failure to achieve 
anticipated synergies, an d the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.ITEM 1B    Unresolved Staff Comments

Table of ContentsITEM 7    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global packag
ed foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We workcontinuously to 
improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equityof our brands over time with st
rong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We beli eve our brand-buildingstrategy is the key to winning and sus
taining leading share positions in markets around the globe.Our 
fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in organic net sales,adjusted operating profi
t, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and cash return to shareholders are key driv ers of financial performance for ourbusiness.
Our long-term growth objectiv
es are to consistently deliver: 
•
 low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;•
 mid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;•
 high single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS;•
 free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and•
 cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We continue to pursue our Consumer Fi
rst strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all b rands and across allgeographies through strong innovat
ion, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accel erating growth on our four differentialgrowth platforms, 
which are Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream, snack bars, Old
El
Paso
 Mexican food, and our portfolio o f natural and organic food brands; and 3)reshaping our portfolio through g
rowth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitu res, including the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. By focusing on this growthframework, we expect to gene
rate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should result in long-term value cre
ation for our shareholders.In fiscal 2019 we executed wel
l and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets, including organic net sal es growth and constant-currencygrowth in net sales, adjusted ope
rating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS. Relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in U.S. Yogurt andour emerging market busin
esses, we increased our contribut ions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the U.S., and we generated greaterbenefits from net price realization
 and mix through our Strategic Revenue Management capability. These results were partially offset by challenging performance for U.S. snack bars, 
leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets.We successfully transi
tioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net salesand segment operating prof
it excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings,increased benefits f
rom net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjus ted operating profit and adjusteddiluted EPS ahead of our initia
l targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flowconversion.
Our consolidated net sales fo
r fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 pe
rcent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currencybasis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compar
ed to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased4 percent on a constant-cu
rrency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generallyaccepted accounting pr
inciples (GAAP)).

Table of ContentsNet cash provided by operations to
taled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earningsattributable to red
eemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cashflow was $2.3 billion at a 
conversion rate of 115 perc ent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrollinginterests. We also re
turned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion. A detailed review of our fis
cal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed rev
iew of our fiscal 2018 performance compared to our fiscal 2017 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended May 27, 2018 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal2018 Results of Consolidated Operations.”
In fiscal 2020, our plans includ
e continued strong innovation and investments in capabilities and brand building to accelerate our topline growth, efficiencyinitiatives to main
tain our strong margins, and a disciplined focus on cash to further reduce our leverage. We remain confident that executing our ConsumerFirst strategy and our Compete, Ac
celerate, and Reshape growth framework will drive sustainable, profitabl e growth and attractive long-term returns for ourshareholders.
Our key full-year fisca
l 2020 targets are summarized below: 
•
 Organic net sales are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent.•
 Constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2 to 4 percent from the base of $2.8 billion reported in f iscal 2019. Benefit of the 53rd 
week in fiscal 2020 will be reinvested in capabilities and brand-building initiatives to drive improvement in our organic net sales growth rate in 2020 and beyond.
•
 Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to increase 3 to 5 percent from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019. •
 Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings. See the 
“Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.Certain terms used throughout 
this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this r eport.FISCAL 2019 CONSOL
IDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buf
falo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fisca
l 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.In fiscal 2019, 
net sales increased 7 pe rcent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscalyear ended May 26, 2019. Operating prof
it margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by  impairment chargesrecorded for certa
in intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operatingprofit margin incre
ased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and adm inistrative expenses in our North America Retailsegment and the addition of Blu
e Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily drivenby a 
one-time benefit recorded in f iscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percenton a constant-currency bas
is (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Cost of sales 
increased $804 million in fiscal 2019 to $11,108 million. The increase was driven by a $503 million increase due to higher volume and a$194 million increase a
ttributable to product rate and mix, including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53 millioncharge related to the fair 
value adjustment of inven tory acquired in the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We recorded a $36 million net increase in cost of salesrelated to 
mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity pos itions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of $32 million in fiscal 2018 (pleasesee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2019, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges in cost of

increased 6 percent in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34.1 percent decreased 40 basis pointscompared to fiscal 2018.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 
expenses increased $86 mil lion to $2,936 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in SG&A expenses primarily refl
ects the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by a decrease in media and advertising expense. SG&A expenses as apercent of net sales in 
fiscal 2019 decreased 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2018. Divestitures loss 
 totaled $30 million in f iscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, andrecorded a 
pre-tax loss of $35 million. We also sold ou r yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with thepurchaser for their use o
f the Yoplait
 brand. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $5 million. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit cos
ts totaled $275 million in f iscal 2019 compared to $166 million in fiscal 2018.In fiscal 2019, as a result o
f lower sales projections in our long range plans for the businesses supporting our Progresso

brand intangible assets, we r ecorded $193 million of impairment charges related to these brand intangible assets (please see Note 6 to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 of this report for additional information). In addition, in fiscal 2019, we r
ecorded a $15 million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segm

Table of ContentsOur 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 17.7 percent compared to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2018. The 15.0 percentage point inc rease reflects the lowerstatutory rate in fis
cal 2019 being more than offset by the impact of the one-time, provisional net benefit o f $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the TCJA. Our adjusted effective 
tax rate was 21.8 percent in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a 
description of our use of me asures not defined by GAAP). The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily dueto the net benefits assoc
iated with the TCJA, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by jurisdiction. The TCJA includes provisions affect
ing our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations to 21 percent; 
a provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (GILTI); a limitation on deductibleinterest expense; the 
repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and a limitation on the d eductibility of certain executive compensation. In fiscal 2019,we completed our accounting 
for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and themeasurement of our net U.S. def
erred tax liability.After-tax 
earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million to $72 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11 millionafter-tax 
share of restructuring charges at CPW, and lower net sales and higher input costs for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreas
ed 14 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use ofmeasures not defined by GAAP). The components o

with whole meats, fruits, and veg etables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings addressspecific dietary, l
ifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, produ ct functions andtextures, and cuts for wet foods. 
We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment opera

Unallocated

and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related  costs, and otheritems that are not pa
rt of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until pass
ed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this report.In fiscal 2019, unallocat
ed corporate expense increased $134 million to $340 million compared to $206 m illion last year, primarily driven by compensationand benefits expenses. In fis
cal 2019, we recorded a $36 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positionsand grain inventories comp
ared to a $32 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges, and $1 million of restructu
ring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019, compared to $14 million of restructuring charges and $11 million ofrestructuring initiative project-related 
costs in cost of sales in fis cal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $16 million gain from a legal recovery related to ourYoplait SAS subsidiary and $23 million of ga
ins related to certain investment valuation adjustments. We also recorded $26 million of in tegration costs infiscal 2019 related to ou
r acquisition of Blue Buffalo compared to $34 million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded a$3 million loss related 
to the impact of hyperinfla tionary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019.IMPACT OF INFLATION
We experienced input cos
t inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2019 and 4 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of approximately 4 perc
ent in fiscal 2020. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our riskmanagement practi
ces are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY
The primary source of our l
iquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $5.6 billion in cash.A substantial portion of this ope
rating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash fromoperations to fund our capit
al expenditures and acquisitions. We typica lly use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionallyissue shares of stock, to finan
ce significant acquisitions.As of May 26, 2019, we had $399 million of cash and c
ash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidi
aries were taxed in the U.S. via the one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. We have re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although ea
rnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertionbeginning with our fiscal 2018 ea
rnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding tax es related to certain entities fromwhich we began repatriating und
istributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings. As a result of thetransition tax, we may 
repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income taxliability (please s

 During fiscal 2019, cash provided by ope
rations was $2,807 million compared to $2,841 million in the same period last year. The $34 million d ecrease wasprimarily driven by a $377 m
illion decrease in net earnings and a $550 million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $598 millionchange in deferred inco
me taxes. The $550 million change in cur rent assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413 million change in the timing ofaccounts payable, including 
the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years. The change in deferred income tax es was primarilyrelated to the $638 mil
lion provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of theTCJA in fiscal 2018.
We strive to grow core working c
apital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2019, core working capital decreased 34 percent, compared to a net sales increas
e of 7 percent. As of May 26, 2019, our core working capital balance totaled $385 million, down 34 percent versus last year, this isprimarily driven by cont
inued benefits from our payment terms extension program and lower inv entory balances. In fiscal 2018, core working capitaldecreased 27 percent, co
mpared to a net sales increase of 1 percent.

 To ensure availability o

We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backedcredit lines that suppor
t our foreign operations.Certain of our long-term d
ebt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all o
f these covenants.We have $1,396 million of long-

Table of ContentsAs of May 26, 2019, our total debt, including 
the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 74 percent in fixed- rate and 26 percent infloating-rate inst
ruments, compared to 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 27, 2018.Our net debt to operating cash 
flow ratio declined to 5.0 in fiscal 2019 from 5.4 in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in long-term debt. Our netdebt-to-adjusted 
earnings before net int erest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio declined to 3.9 in fiscal 2019 from 4.2 on a pro forma basisin fiscal 2018, 
consistent with our plans to redu ce our leverage following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure not de
fined by GAAP).We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remai
ning interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We recordSodiaal’s 50 percent inte
rest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncon trolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as aredeemable inter
est on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaa
l has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three timesbefore December 2024. As of May 26, 2019, the 
redemption value of the redeemable inter est was $552 million which approximates its fair value.During the second quarter of f
iscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $56 million in Yoplait SAS. The third-party holder of 
the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the applicatio
n of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million
). On June 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred 
return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through aremarketing auction.
We have an option to purchase 
the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whol
e amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will becharged directly to r
etained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that p eriod.OFF-BALANCE 
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSAs of May 26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and 
comfort letters of $682 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort 
letters of $134 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, main ly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are gen
erally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which tot aled $483 million as of May 26, 2019.As of May 26, 2019, we invested in four variab
le interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the 
fiscal year ended May 26, 2019.Our defined benefit plans in 
the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Pro tection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us tomake additional contr
ibutions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020.

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $0.3 million for capital leases or $72.0 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments.
(b)
Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c)
The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract spe
cifies allsignificant terms, including fixed or 
minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(d)
The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $17.3 million as of May 26, 2019, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those
instruments in the 
future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and 
miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay approximately $20 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately $18 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2020. We are unable to
reliably estimate the 
amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2020. As of May 26, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $165.1 million.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
 ESTIMATESFor a complete 
description of our signifi cant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Oursignificant accounting estimate
s are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of oper ations. Theseestimates include our 
accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-basedcompensation, income tax
es, and defined benefit pension, other postretiremen t benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are reported n
et of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer couponredemption and 
other costs, including esti mated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded usingsignificant judgment of e
stimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences betwe en estimated expenses andactual costs are re
cognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade liabilities were $484 million as of May 26, 2019,and $500 million as of 
May 27, 2018. Because these amounts ar e significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments insubsequent periods that could hav
e a significant effect on our results of operations.

Table of ContentsValuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the use
ful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events orchanges in 
circumstances indic ate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discountedcash flows or independent appra
isals, as appropriate.Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other 
indefinite-lived intangible as sets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changesin circumstances indicate that im
pairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determ ined based on adiscounted cash flow model. We us
e inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates ofdiscount rates, perpetui
ty growth assumptions, market comparables, and other f actors.We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination onuseful life requires s
ignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (suchas the stability of the 
industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in di
stribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are 
deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our estimate of the fa
ir value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inpu ts which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty 
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.As of May 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying va
lue and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regardingfuture performance o
f our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material im pairment losses and amortization expense.We performed our fisc
al 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of lower salesprojections in our 
long-range plans for the busin esses supporting the Progresso

In fiscal 2019, we adjusted the 
redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimat
e the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending,depreciation and taxes, 
foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value o f the redeemable interest was$552 million.
Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is 
a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a materialimpact 
on our financial state ments. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividendyield, and the forfeitu
re rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial State ments in Item 8 of thisreport.
The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year   
  2019    2018    2017   
 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted  $ 5.35      $ 6.18     $ 8.80   Assumptions:
      Risk-free interest rate
   2.9 %     2.2 %     1.7 %  Expected term
   8.5 years      8.2 years      8.5 years   Expected volatility
   16.3 %    15.8 %    17.8 % Dividend yield
   4.3 %     3.6 %     2.9 %   
 The risk-free inter
est rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time ofgrant. An increase in the exp
ected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 9 percent. If all otherassumptions are held constan
t, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal2019 option awards by 8 percent.
To the extent that actu
al outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.Historical data has a sign
ificant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead toprospective revisions in our 
assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comp arability of stock-based compensation expense.

Table of ContentsAny corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings ( referred to as a windfalltax benefit) is presen
ted in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend,in part, on the volume of emp
loyee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of theunderlying stock and the origin
al grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.Realized windfall tax ben
efits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the ConsolidatedStatement of Earnings. Becaus
e employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported resultscould occur if differ
ent assumptions or conditions were to prevail.Income Taxes
We apply a 
more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognit ion and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of taxbenefit that has a gre
ater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately real ized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expectedultimate resolution o
f uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 14 tothe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8 of this report.Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Bene
fit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefi
t pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide heal
th care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we alsoprovide accruable bene
fits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Ple ase see Note 13 to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lans.We recognize benefi
ts provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make variousassumptions to predict and m
easure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significantmanagement judgment and 
have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and  accumulated benefit obligationsinclude the long-term 
rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate 
of return on plan assets is de termined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of futurelong-term returns by asse
t class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflat ion assumptions. Wereview this assumption annual
ly for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantlyinfluence our evaluation.
Our historical investmen
t returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assetswere 6.6 percent, 6.6 percent, 10.3 p
ercent, 8.4 percent, and 7.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 26, 2019.On a weighted-average basis, th
e expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.25 percent for fiscal 2019, 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, and 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017. For 
fiscal 2020, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefitpension and other postretir
ement plans in the United States to 7.0 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns.Lowering the expected long-t
erm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretir ement expense by $70 million forfiscal 2020. A market-re
lated valuation basis is used to reduce 
36

Table of Contentsyear-to-year 
expense volatility. The  market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period fro m the year in whichthey occur. Investment 
gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets andthe actual return based o
n the market-related value of assets. Our outside ac tuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expenseor income.
Discount Rates
We estimate the se
rvice and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefitpension, other postretire
ment benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along theyield curve used to deter
mine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions a re determined annually as ofMay 31 for our defined benefi
t pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries todetermine the tim
ing and amount of expected future cash ou tflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop aforward interest rat
e curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected fu ture cashoutflows to determine our dis
count rate assumptions.Our weighted-average discount 
rates were as follows: 
 
  Defined BenefitPension Plans
  Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans
  PostemploymentBenefit Plans
  
 Effective rate fo
r fiscal 2020 service costs   4.17 %   4.04 %   3.51%  Effective rate for fiscal 2020
 interest costs   3.45 %   3.28 %   2.84%  Obligations as of May 31, 2019
   3.91 %   3.79 %   3.10%  Effective rate fo
r fiscal 2019 service costs   4.34 %   4.27 %   3.99%  Effective rate for fiscal 2019
 interest costs   3.92 %   3.80 %   3.37%  Obligations as of May 31, 2018
   4.20 %   4.17 %   3.60%  Effective rate fo

 interest costs   3.45 %   3.24 %   2.67%   
 Lowering the discount rates by 100 bas
is points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2020 by 
approximately $55 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line methodover the average remaining 
service period of active plan participants or over the a verage remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan isviewed as “all or almost
 all” inactive participants.Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We review our health care 
cost trend rates annual ly. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and informationprovided by our actuaries. This 
information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organi
zations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, andshort-term expectations. 
Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 p ercent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65at the end of fiscal 2019. Rat
es are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations o
nly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,to approximate the cur
rent economic view on the rate of long-term inflation  plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for healthcare costs have an importa
nt effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

 plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or a lmost all” inactive participants.Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2019, we recorded ne
t defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $24 million compared to$23 million of expense in fis
cal 2018 and $56 million of expense in fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net lossesof $2.0 billion on our defined bene
fit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuari al net gains of $81 million on our postretirement andpostemployment benefit pla
ns, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of planassets. 
These unrecognized actua rial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currentlyexceed the corridors de
fined by GAAP.Actual future net defin
ed benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investmentperformance, changes in f
uture discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in theseplans.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRON
OUNCEMENTSIn August 
2017, the Financial Accounting Standa rds Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedgeaccounting recognition a
nd presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. Th e new standard alsosimplifies the appli
cation of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning afterDecember 15, 2018, and interim p
eriods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not expect this guidance to havea material impa
ct on our results of operations or financial position.In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in certain leasesbeing capitalized as 
a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard and subsequentamendments are eff
ective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us isthe first quarter of 
fiscal 2020. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transitionapproach, which requires 
application of the guida nce in all comparative periods presented, or the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requiresapplication of the guidan
ce at the adoption date.We are in the process of 
implementing lease accounting software, developing a centralized business process, and implementing corresponding controls. Wehave 
substantially complet ed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020using the cumulative effect a
djustment approach and electing certain practical expedients permitted under the t ransition guidance, including not reassessingwhether existing contrac
ts contain leases and carrying forward the historical 
38

Table of Contentsclassification of thos
e leases. In addition, we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated BalanceSheets. We do not expect the e
ffects to the Consolidated Financial St atements to be pervasive. We estimate that we will record right of use assets andrelated liabili
ties of approximately $400 to $500 million, subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our lease portfolio and discount rates. We do not expect th
is guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financi
al Statements in Item 8 of this report for noncancela ble future lease commitments.NON-GAAP 
MEASURES We have included in this r
eport measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide usefulinformation to 
investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.For each of these 
non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing be low a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparabl

arable GAAP measure.Several 
measures below are presen ted on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, inmanagement’s judgment, si
gnificantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating r esults.Organic Net Sales Growth Rates
We provide organic net sa
les growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directorsand executive managem

Table of ContentsForward-Looking Financial Measures
Our fiscal 2020 outlook for organi
c net sales growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise bee
n adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuringcharges and 
project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2020 out look for organic net sales growthalso excludes the 
effect of a 53rd week, acqu isitions, and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonabl e efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonabledegree of certainty the actual im
pact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures andrestructuring actions 
throughout fiscal 2020. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2020 GAAP financial results.For fiscal 2020, we currently exp
ect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions,divestitures, and a 53rd week to 
increase net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterialimpact on adjusted opera
ting profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth; and restructuring charges and project-r elated costs related to actions previouslyannounced to total approxim
ately $49 million.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO

losures About Market RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factorscould 
cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks byentering into various hedging 
transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in thesetransactions are gene
rally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to avariety of derivative financial 
instruments. For informat ion on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note7 to the Consolidated Financial St
atements in Item 8 of this report.VALUE AT RISK
The estimates in the t
able below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interestrates, foreign exchange 
rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the marke
t risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. The VAR calculation used historic
al interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of
 these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics ™ data set. The calculations are not intended torepresent actual losses in 
fair value that we expe ct to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlyingexposure, we would expect that any loss o
r gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decreas e in the fair value ofthe underlying exposure. The posit
ions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodityswaps, futures, and options; and equity 
instruments. The calculations do not includ e the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-relatedpositions that are offse
t by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The Company’s management is 
responsible for these c onsolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,and for its assessment of th
e effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9a Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financ
ial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion onthe Company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the Public CompanyAccounting Oversight Board (United Stat
es) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securiti
es laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in 
accordance with the stand ards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effec tiveinternal control over financial
 reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated 
financial statements included pe rforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand significant estim
ates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall prese ntation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evalu
ating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performingsuch other procedures as we consid
ered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a r easonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitat

Table of Contentsaccordance with genera
lly accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that(1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany; (2) provide rea
sonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial state ments in accordance withgenerally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assu rance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,or disposition of t
he company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the poli
cies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLP

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASS IFICATIONSBasis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial State
ments include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.Intercompany transac
tions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.Our fiscal year ends on the l
ast Sunday in May.Certain 
reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 foradditional information.
Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term 
plan to conform the fisc al year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills BrasilAlimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia 
& Latin America segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our r
esults included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not mate rial to ourconsolidated results of ope
rations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOU
NTING POLICIESCash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all 
investments purchased with an o riginal maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Inventories
All inventories in the United St
ates other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventoriesare valued at net realizable value
, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earningscurrently.
Inventories outside of the Uni
ted States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realiz able value.Shipping 
costs associated with the dis tribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the relatedfinished product is shipped to and 
accepted by the customer.Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land 
is recorded at histori cal cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost anddepreciated over estimated usef
ul lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charg ed to cost of sales. Buildingsare usually deprecia
ted over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets areretained in buildings and equ
ipment until disposal. When an item is sold o r retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciationand the resulting gains and loss
es, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 26, 2019, assets held for sale were insignificant. Long-lived assets are rev
iewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An i
mpairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of theasset group are less than th
e carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable c ash flows and are largely 
58

Table of Contentsindependent of other asset g
roups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fairvalue. Fair value is measu
red using a discounted cash flow model or ind ependent appraisals, as appropriate.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amort
ization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay have 
occurred. We perform ou r annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of thefiscal year. Impairment testing i
s performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to thefair value of the unit. Ca
rrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requiresallocation of shared or 
corporate items among reporting units. If th e carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. Werecognize an impair
ment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the repo
rting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits aredetermined using inputs fro
m our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of dis count rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, marketcomparables, and other f
actors.We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, main ly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination onuseful life requires s
ignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the 
industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in distr
ibution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditu res, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.Intangible assets that are 
deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue

brands, are also tested fo r impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying v
alue may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs whichincluded projected rev
enues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payab le if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.Our finite-lived intang
ible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and custome r relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstanc
es indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimatedundiscounted 
future cash flows from the op eration and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally haveidentifiable cash f
lows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the ca rrying amountof the asset over its fa
ir value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our 
investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings orlosses. We receive roya
lty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and developmen t), and record the tax impact ofcertain joint ventur
e operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capitalinvestments. We also sel
l certain raw materials, semi- finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.In addition, we assess our investm
ents in our joint ventures if we have reason to b elieve an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as aresult of ongoing operating loss
es, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions
 
59

Table of Contentsused to estimate fai
r value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates,and a discount rate. By their 
nature, these project ions and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment wasless than the carrying va
lue of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the invest mentto its fair value if we 
concluded the impairment is other than temporary.Redeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to pu
t all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December2024. This put option requires us to cl
assify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable inter est outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long asthe put is exercisable by Sodi
aal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on ourConsolidated Balance Sheets. We 
adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheetsquarterly to the redeemable intere
st’s redemption value, which approximates its fa ir value. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, we adjustedthe redeemable int
erest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected rev
enue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and adiscount rate.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues primarily r
esult from contracts with custo mers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the delivery ofproduct. We recognize r
evenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of theproduct has transferred 
to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handlingcharges billed to the cus
tomer and are reported net of variable consideration and consider ation payable to our customers, including trade promotion,consumer coupon redemption and o
ther costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and 
other excise taxes ar e not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation andperformance levels for offered 
programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change inmanagement estima
te in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to re
turn product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivablesfrom customers genera
lly do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection patterns are short-term, and vary around the world and by channel, and as such,we do not have any significant f
inancing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing rece
ivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written offagainst the allowance when we 
deem the amount is uncoll ectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how thenature, amount, timing, and un
certainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material contract assets or liabilities arising from our contra
cts with customers.Environmental Costs
Environmental costs rel
ating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilitiesfor anticipated re
mediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than thecompletion of feasibi
lity studies or our commitment to a plan of action.Advertising Production Costs
We expense the 
production costs of  advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Table of ContentsResearch and Development
All expenditures for rese
arch and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product andmanufacturing process innov
ation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable toR&D activities. Other costs in
clude depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities  that are engaged in pilot plant activities.Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant foreig
n operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income s
tatement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arereflected within accumulated ot
her comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included innet earnings for the per
iod, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and loss
es on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are 
recognized on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and arerecorded in either cu
rrent or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are r ecorded in net earnings orother comprehensive inco
me, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.Gains or losses on derivative ins
truments reported in AOCI are reclass ified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlyinghedged transaction ceas
es to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is r ecognized inearnings in the current p
eriod.Stock-based Compensation
We generally measur
e compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share of our stock on thedate 
of grant. We estimat e the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally, stock-based compensation is recognizedstraight line over the v
esting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administr ative (SG&A) expenses and cost ofsales in our Consolidated State
ments of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results.Certain equity-based comp
ensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employeesand 
directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequentservice. Accordingly, the r
elated compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retir ement-eligible individuals or over theperiod from the grant da
te to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.We report the benefi
ts of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Bene
fit, and Postemployment Benefit PlansWe sponsor several domesti
c and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Undercertain 
circumstances, we also prov ide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.We recognize an obliga
tion for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits th at do not vest or accumulate withservice (such as severan
ce based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plansare unfunded.
 
61

Table of ContentsWe recognize the under
funded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in th e funded status inthe year in which the changes o
ccur through AOCI.In fiscal 2018, we approved an am
endment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined bene fit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted inthe spinoff of a portion of th
e General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan(Grandfathered) (toge
ther, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.The result of the reorgan
ization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplementa l Retirement Plan I and theSupplemental Retiremen
t Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investmentstrategy over time and 
to provide additional flexibil ity in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with thePlan and the Supplemental Plans a
re amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses asso ciatedwith the Plan I and the Supplement
al Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description ofour defined benefit pension, o
ther postretirement benefit, and postemploymen t benefit plans.Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financi
al Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to makeestimates 
and assumptions that affe ct reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financialstatements, and the repo
rted amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotionalexpenditures, valuation of 
long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension,other postretiremen
t benefit and postemployment benefit pla ns. Actual results could differ from our estimates.New Accounting Standards
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, netperiodic postretirement benefit e
xpense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively “net periodic benefit expense”). The new standardrequires the service 
cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within ourConsolidated Statements of Ea
rnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in ourConsolidated Statements of 
Earnings. In addition, the new stand ard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligiblefor capitalizat
ion. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective appl ication of thecapitalization of 
the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profitof $87.9 million, $89.4 million and 
$74.3 million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan non-service income of $87.9 million, $89.4 mi llion and$74.3 million for fiscal 2019, 
fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. There were no changes to our repo rted segment operating profit.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue f rom contracts with customers. Under the newstandard, we apply a principl
es-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amountthat reflects the 
consideration for which we expe ct to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The principles-based five step model includes: 1)identifying the contract(s) 
with a customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determining the transaction price; 4) allocating thetransaction price to the perf
ormance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We utilized acomprehensive approach to 
evaluate and document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices. We did not identify anymaterial diffe
rences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and cont
rols to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of thenew standard and subsequent amendm
ents to all contracts in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach. 
62

Table of ContentsWe recorded a $33.9 milli
on cumulative effect adjustment net of income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease todeferred income taxes of 
$11.4 million, and an increas e to other current liabilities of $45.3 million related to the timing of recognition of certainpromotional expenditures.
In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff AccountingBulletin 
No. 118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that theaccounting is not complet
e and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not available, prepared, or analyzed to determine areasonable estimat
e, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date tofinalize the accoun
ting related to the TCJA. In fiscal 2019, we completed ou r accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA.In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the optio n to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting fromthe TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. 
We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retainedearnings. 
This reclassificat ion consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The newaccounting requiremen
ts allowed for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the prov isional amountsrecorded.
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-bas ed payments. The adoption of this guidanceresulted in the prospect
ive recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in ourConsolidated Statements of 
Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Shee ts. We retrospectively adopted the guidancerelated to reclassification of realized
 windfall tax benefits, which resulted in reclassi fications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activitiesin our Consolidated Statements o
f Cash Flows. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee taxwithholdings, which resulted in re
classifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Stock-based compensati
on expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by theamount by which a reporting unit
’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to bemeasured by determining 
the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment test was pe rformed as of the first day of the second quarter offiscal 2018, and the adoption of 
this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing apractical expedien
t to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidanceretrospectively and r
estated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operationsor financial position.
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which perm it reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a 
month-end to apply a practical expedie nt that permits the entity to measure defined benef it plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal 
year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. Th e adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact onour results of operations or 
financial position.NOTE 3. 
ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES During the third quarter of 
fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $35.4 million. During the fourth qua

eously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait
 brand. We recorded a 
pre-tax gain of $5.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion,including $103.0 million of consid
eration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with the definitive agreement and plan of merger, a subsidiary of General Mil
ls merged into Blue Buffalo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. Inaccordance with the me
rger agreement, equity holders of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per share in cash. We financ ed the transaction with a combination of$6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in 
equity, and cash on hand. In fiscal 2019, we recorded acquisition integration costs of $25.6 million in SG&A expenses.In 
fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition transaction and integration costs of $34.0 million in SG&A expenses and $49.9 million in interest, net related to thedebt issued to finance the 
acquisition.We consolidated Blue Buffalo 
into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3 billion, an indefinite-lived intangible asset for the Blue Buffalo
brand of $2.7 billion, and a fini te-lived customer relationship asset of $269.0 million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growthopportunities and any intangib
le assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is inc luded in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductiblefor tax purposes. In the fourth qu
arter of fiscal 2019, we recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6 millionincrease to goodwill.

We view our restructuring 
activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and net present value targ
ets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in thecase of multi-year p
rograms), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. The se activities result in various restructuring costs,including asset write-of
fs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciationassociated with 
restructured assets, as us ed in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expensecaused by shortening the useful 
life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of produc tion under an approvedrestructuring plan. Any impa
irment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.Charges recorded in fisca

accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted line of credit.The fair value and car
rying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $13,272.8 million and $13,021.3 million, respectively, as of May 26, 2019. The fair value of long-
term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incrementalborrowing rates for simil
ar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
As a part of our ongoing operations, we a
re exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity andequity 
prices. To manage these r isks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our establishedpolicies.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Many commodities we use in the 
production and distribution of ou r products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price riskfor our principal ingred
ients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and dies elfuel. Our primary objecti
ve when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of 
70

Table of Contentscommodities purchased fo
r use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts withsuppliers, exchange-trad
ed futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposur es based on current and projected marketconditions and generally se
ek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible. We use derivatives to m
anage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative pos
itions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our ConsolidatedStatements of Earnings.
Although we do not meet the crit
eria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providingcertainty in the futu
re price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performancethese gains and losses are r
eported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managingaffects earnings. At tha
t time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments torealize the economic effects of 
the derivative without exp eriencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains  in unallocated corporate items.Unallocated corporate 
items for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 included:

f commodity derivatives was $312.5 million, of which $242.9 million related to agricul tural inputs and$69.6 million related to 
energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to inter
est rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primaryexposures include U.S. Treasury rat
es, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forwa rd-starting interest r
ate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve adesired proportion of
 fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and proj ected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with acounterparty to exchange 
the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.Floating Interest Rate Exposur
es — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as c ash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances ofdebt. Effectiveness is a
ssessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments onthe underlying debt. Effec
tive gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains andlosses are recorded as ne
t interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2019, a $2.6 million loss in fiscal 2018, and lessthan $1 million in fisca
l 2017.Fixed Interest Rate Exposures 
— Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps ar e accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changesin the fair value of th
e underlying debt and derivatives, using  
71

Table of Contentsincremental borrowing r
ates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and theunderlying hedged items ar
e recorded as net interest. The amount of hedg e ineffectiveness was a $2.4 million gain in fiscal 2019, a $3.4 million loss infiscal 2018, and a $4.3 million g
ain in fiscal 2017.In advance of planned debt f
inancing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0 million of treasury locks due April 19, 2018, with an average fixed rat
e of 2.9 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $43.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent withthe issuance of our $850.0 mill
ion 5.5-year fixed-rate notes, $800.0 mi llion 7-year fixed-rate notes, $1,400.0 mi llion 10-year fixed-rate notes, $500.0 million 
20-year fixed-rate notes, and $650.0 m illion 30-year fixed-rate notes. In advance of planned debt f
inancing, in fiscal 2018, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks due October 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 1.8 percent. All of these tr
easury locks were cash settled for $3.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our$500.0 million 
5-year fixed-rate notes. As of May 26, 2019, the

Foreign currency fluctua
tions affect our net invest ments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases,intercompany loans, product sh
ipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposur
es are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, 
72

Table of ContentsMexican peso, and Swiss franc. We pr
imarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. Wealso generally swap our fore
ign-denominated commercial paper bo rrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or thefunctional currency of 
the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on 
the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.As of May 26, 2019, the 
net notional value of for eign exchange derivatives was $1,008.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than$1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.
We also have net investm
ents in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuingeuro-denominated comm
ercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 26, 2019, we hedged a portion of these net investments with€2,200.0 million of euro denomina
ted bonds. As of May 26, 2019, we had deferred net foreign currency trans action losses of $51.5 million in AOCIassociated with net invest
ment hedging activity.EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements a
ffect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued.We use 
equity swaps to manage this risk. As of M ay 26, 2019, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $169.1 million. These swap contractsmature in fiscal 2020.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTIN
GENT FEATURESCertain of our derivativ
e instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rating agencies. If o
ur debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization onderivative instruments in 
net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were ina liability position on May 26, 2019, was $7.4 
million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent featuresunderlying these agreem
ents had been triggered on May 26, 2019, we would have been required to post $7.4 million of collateral to counterparties.CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND

tinually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposureto any one party. These transa
ctions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these coun terparties; however, we have notincurred a materi
al loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges.The amount of loss due to the cr
edit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is$2.4 million against which we do not hold 
collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other securityto support financial inst
ruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasuryinstruments and are held 
in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.

pre-tax loss. NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONC
ONTROLLING INTERESTSOur principal redeemab
le and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 
foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $4.9 million as of May 26, 2019.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests 
in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominatedinterest in Yoplait SAS as a rede
emable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaa l has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interestto us at fair value once p
er year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets qua
rterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividendsannually if it meets 
certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders’ agreement. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value of the euro-denominatedredeemable inter
est was $551.7 million.On the acquisition dates, we re
corded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar
-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait MarquesSNC earns a royalty stream through 
a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to 
Yoplait
  and related trademarks. Li berté Marques Sàrl earns aroyalty stream through l
icensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to 
Liberté
  and related tradema rks. These entities paydividends annually based on thei
r available cash as of their fiscal year end.We paid dividends of 
$22.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $37.7 million in fiscal 2018 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC,and Liberté Marques Sàrl sha
reholder agreements.A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into 
an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined pricesthrough 
July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $210.8 m illion for fiscal 2019 and $230.8 million for fiscal 2018.During the second quarter of f
iscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $55.7 million in Yoplait SAS.The holder of the GMC Class A Interests r
eceives quarterly preferred distributions from available net incom e based on the application of a floatingpreferred return rate to the h
older’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1,2018, the floating prefer
red return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. Th e preferred returnrate is adjusted every 
three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.For financial reporting pu
rposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries are includedin our Consolidated Financial Sta
tements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable toredeemable and noncontro
lling interests in our Consolidated St atements of Earnings.Our noncontrolling interests 
contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

 In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting fromthe TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. 
We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retainedearnings. Please see Note 14 for 
additional information.NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS
We use broad-based stock plans 
to help ensure that manag ement’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 26, 2019, a total of30.3 million shares were ava
ilable for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestrict ed stock under the2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan a
lso provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, andperformance-based sto
ck awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some grant ed under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and2011 compensation plans for 
non-employee directors, under which no furth er awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potentia l acceleratedvesting of awards upon retire
ment, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.Stock Options
The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year   
  2019    2018    2017   
 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted  $ 5.35    $ 6.18    $ 8.80   Assumptions:
       Risk-free interest rate
   2.9 %     2.2%     1.7 %  Expected term
   8.5 years     8.2 years      8.5 years  Expected volatility
   16.3 %    15.8%     17.8 %  Dividend yield
   4.3 %     3.6%     2.9 %  
 We estimate the f
air value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock 
price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility usingthe historical volatility over
 the expected term of the option, excluding time per iods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude inestimating our stock pri
ce volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with 
tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. 
85

Table of ContentsOur expected term repr
esents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate opti on exercises andemployee terminations withi
n the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregatedinto a single pool for valua
tion purposes. The weighted-average expec ted term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interestrate for periods during th
e expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time of grant.Any corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings ( referred to as a windfalltax benefit) is presen
ted in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall taxdeficiencies related to the exercise
 or vesting of stock-based awards are re cognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We recognized windfall taxbenefits from stock-bas
ed payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $24.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $25.5 million in fiscal 2018.
Options may be priced at 100 per
cent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the d ate of grant. Optionsgenerally expire within 10 y
ears and one month after the date of grant.Information on stock option a

ed to key employees under the 2017 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted fouryears after the dat
e of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future achievement of three-year goals  for average organic net salesgrowth and cumulative fre
e cash flow. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to a three year performance andvesting period. The sale or t
ransfer of these

 NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEF
ITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSDefined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit 
pension plans covering many emp loyees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits forsalaried employees a
re based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for e achyear of credited serv
ice. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principalU.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expe
ct to be required to make any cont ributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan coveringsalaried employees has 
a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. All sala
ried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pensionplan.
In fiscal 2018, we approved an am
endment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted inthe spinoff of a portion of th
e General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan(Grandfathered) (toge
ther, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to th e plans’ participants were unchanged.The result of the reorgan
ization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and theSupplemental Retiremen
t Plan I (Grandfathered) (toge ther, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investmentstrategy over time and 
to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Su
pplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated withthe Plan I and the Supplementa
l Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of t he participants.

Table of ContentsOther Postretirement Bene
fit PlansWe also sponsor plans that provid
e health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried healthcare benefit plan is 
contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees andretirees on an annual bas
is. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. Health Care Cost Trend Rates
Assumed health care cost t
rends are as follows: 
 
 Fiscal Year   
 2019       2018   
 Health care cost trend 
rate for next year  6.4% and 6.7%        6.7% and 7.0%  Rate to which the cost trend r
ate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)  4.5%        4.5%  Year that the rate reaches the
 ultimate trend rate  2029        2029   
 We review our health ca
re cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This 
information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions usedby other similar organi
zations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as nec essary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, andshort-term expecta
tions. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rat
es are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates areapplicable for calculations o
nly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,to approximate the current ec
onomic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an importa
nt effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point 
change in the health ca re cost trend rate would have the following effects:

 Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circums
tances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, andMexico. 
We recognize an obliga tion for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulatewith service (such as sever
ance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemploy ment benefitplans are unfunded.

Determined utilizing the full yield curve method.Discount Rates
We estimate the se
rvice and interest cost components of the net period ic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefitpension, other postretire
ment benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to deter
mine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as ofMay 31 for our defined benefi
t pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefi t plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31to determine defined b
enefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. Wework 
with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Mediancorporate bond yield, to deve
lop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve isapplied to our expected fu
ture cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and otherpostretirement benefit plan p
ortfolios are broadly diversified across asset cla sses. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified acrossinvestment styles and inves
tment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 18 percent to equities in the United Stat
es; 11 percent to international equities; 9 percent to private equities; 48 percent to fixed income; and 14 percent to real assets (realestate, energy, and infr
astructure). For other U.S. postretirement benefi t plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18 percent to equities in theUnited States; 10 percent to 
international equities; 4 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 3 percent to real assets (real  estate, energy,and timber). The actual allocati
ons to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

 On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results 
in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax system, includ ing areduction in the U.S. corporate 
income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unt axed foreign earnings.As a result 
of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional b enefit of $523.5 million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for thetax effects of the TCJA and re
corded a benefit of $7.2 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the m easurement of our net U.S. deferredtax liability. Whil
e our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations andcurrently availabl
e information, and any additional guidance issu ed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts infuture periods.
The legislation also 
includes provisions that af fected our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate ondomestic operations; th
e creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated exp enses as well ascurrently taxes cer
tain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; therepeal of the domestic manufact
uring deduction; and limitations on the dedu ctibility of certain executive compensation.While the new legislat
ion generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidi aries going forward, certain income earned byforeign subsidiaries must b
e included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to makean accounting 
policy election and re cord the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. In fiscal 2018,we made an accounting policy 
election to record these taxes as a period cost.As of May 26, 2019, we have not recognized a de
ferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our foreign operations because we currently bel
ieve our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not pr
acticable for us to determine the amount o f unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded forearnings of our foreign oper
ations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded 
that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanentreinvestment assert
ion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of the accoun ting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes relatedto certain entiti
es from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings.

rom the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 millionfrom AOCI to retained earnings. Th
is reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporatetax rate.
We are subject to 
federal income tax es in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before anuncertain tax position i
s audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particularuncertain tax position,
 we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the relatedinterest, in light of ch
anging facts and circumstances. Sett lement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.The number of years with open tax 
audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our m ajor taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal andstate) and Canada. Various tax 
examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally fro
m 3 to 5 years.Several state and fore
ign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a mater ial impact on our results ofoperations or financia
l position. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by$40.9 million. We determ
ined the adjustment to be immaterial to ou r Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. We haveeffectively sett
led all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.During fiscal 2017, the Brazil
ian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years.These 
audits included a review of ou r determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB hasproposed adjustments
 that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We beli eve we have meritorious defenses andintend to contest the disa
llowance.We apply a 
more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognit ion and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of taxbenefit that has a gre
ater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately real ized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expectedultimate resolution o
f uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.The following table sets for
th changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.Approximately $81.2 million of 
this total in fiscal 2019 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in futureperiods. This amount differs 
from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because cert ain of the liabilities below would impact deferredtaxes if recognized. W
e also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

 To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars aretranslated into United Sta
tes dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of th e prior fiscal year, rather than the actualaverage exchange rates in effect
 during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currenciesmultiplied by the

ls are defined as follows: 
Level 1:
  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2:
  
Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets orquoted prices for identical
 assets or liabilities in inactive markets.Level 3:
  Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.Focus 6 platforms. 
The Focus 6 platforms for the Conveni ence Stores & Foodservice segment consist of cereal, yogurt, snacks, frozen meals, b iscuits, andbaking mixes.

ctual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to but excluding thenext scheduled interest p

If any interest payment date on the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest payment willbe postponed to the next day that 
is a business day, and no interest on th at payment will accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If thematurity date of the 2020, 2023 o
r 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the nextsucceeding business day, and no inte

“Business day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions ar e authorized or obligatedby law or executive order to 
close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement ExpressTransfer system (the TARGET2 system), o
r any successor thereto, oper ates.Floating
Rate
Notes
. The Floating Rate Notes bear int erest from January 15, 2016 at a floating rate dete rmined in the manner provided below,payable quarterly in a
rrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year and on the maturity date of the Floating Rate Notes (each, an“interest payment 
date”), beginning on April 15, 2016 to th e persons in whose names the Floating Rate Notes are registered at the close of business on the15th calendar day (whether o
r not a business day) immediately preceding the related interest payment date or, if the Floating Rat e Notes are represented byone or more global notes, the 
close of business on the business day (for this purpose a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear are open for business)immediately preceding the related i
nterest payment date; provided, howeve r, that interest payable on the maturity date or any redemption date shall bepayable to the person to whom the p
rincipal of such Floating Rate Notes shall be payable.If any interest paymen
t date (other than the maturity date or any earlier repayment date) falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest payment date will be postponed 
to the next succeeding business day and interest will accrue to but excluding such interest payment date, except that if suchbusiness day falls in the next su
cceeding calendar month, the applicable interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day. If thematurity date or any e
arlier redemption date of the Floating Rate Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal, premium, if any,and interest, if any, 
otherwise payable on such date wi ll be postponed to the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue fromand after the maturity date or
 earlier redemption date, as applicable. The rights of holders of beneficial interests of Floating Rate Not es to receive thepayments of interest on such Flo
ating Rate Notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.The interest rate is 
reset quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 (each an “interest reset date”). However, if any inte rest resetdate would otherwise be a day tha
t is not a business day, such interest reset date will be the next succeeding day that is a business day, except that if the nextsucceeding business day falls 
in the next succeeding calendar month , the applicable interest reset date will be the immediately preceding business day.The initial interest period 
was the period from and includ ing January 15, 2016 to but excluding the first interest reset date. The interest rate ineffect during the ini
tial interest period was equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%), determined two TARGET system days prior to January 15, 2016. A “TARGET system day” is any day in which the TARGET2 System, or any succ
essor thereto, is open for business and a day on which commercialbanks are open for dealings in 
euro deposits in the London interbank market. Wi th respect to Floating Rate Notes in certificated form, the reference tobusiness day will also mean a day on whi
ch banking institutions generally are open for business in the location of each office of a transfer agent, but onlywith respect to a payment o
r other action to occur at that office.After the initial in
terest period, the interest periods are the periods from and including an interest reset date to but excluding the immediatelysucceeding interest reset date
, except that the final interest period will be the period from and including the interest reset date immediately preceding thematurity 
date to but excluding the m aturity date (each an “interest period”). The interest rate per annum for the Floating Rate Notes in any interest periodwill be equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%) (
the “interest rate”), as determined by the calculation  agent. The interest rate in effect for the 15calendar days prior to a
ny redemption date earlier than the maturity date will be the interest rate in effect on the fifteenth day preceding such earlierredemption date.
The interest rate on th
e Floating Rate Notes is limited to the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified byUnited States law of general 
application, and shall not be less than 0.00%Upon the request of any holder of Floa
ting Rate Notes, the calculation agent will pro vide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, theinterest rate that will become effecti
ve on the next interest reset date.The calculation agent wi
ll determine EURIBOR for each interest period on the second TARGET system day prior to the first day of suchinterest 
period (the “interest determinatio n date”).“EURIBOR” with respect to any interest d
etermination date will be the offered rate for depos its of euros having a maturity of three months thatappears on “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” at approxim
ately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such interest determination date. If on an interest determinationdate, such rate 
does not appear on the “Reuters Pag e EURIBOR 01” as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, or if “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” is not available onsuch date, the calcula
tion agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.’s page “BBAM.” If no offered rate appe ars on “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” orBloomberg L.P.’s page “BBAM” on an interest de
termination date, EURIBOR will be determined for such interest determination date on the basis of therates at approximat
ely 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such interest determination date at which deposits in euros are offered to prime banks in the euro-zoneinter-bank market by th
e principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in such market selected and identified by us (the “reference banks”), for aterm of three months co
mmencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is representative for asingle 
transaction in euros in such market at such time. We will ensure the calculation agent is
provided with the complete contact details of the relevant personnel at each of the reference banks that they will be required to contact in order to obtain therelevant interest rate. The 
calculation agent wil l request the principal euro-zone office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least twosuch quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such int
erest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of such quotations. If fewer than two suchquotations are provided, EURIBOR for such inte
rest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m.,Brussels time, on such interes
t determination date by three major banks in the euro-zone, selected and identified by us, for loans in euros to leadingEuropean banks, for a term of 
three months, commencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is representative for 
a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected are not quoting as mentioned above, thethen-existing EURIBOR rate will rem
ain in effect for such interest period, or, if none, the interest rate will be the initial interest rate.All percentages resulting
 from any calculation of any interest rate for the Floating Rate Notes are rounded, i f necessary, to the nearest onehundred thousandth of a percent
age point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point round ed upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all 
euro amounts are rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. The amount o f interestpayable in respect of e
ach note is calculated by applying the applicable interest rate for such interest period to the outstanding principal amount of suchFloating Rate Notes, multiplying 
the product by the actual number of days in such interest period and dividing by 360. Each calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes by the ca
lculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on us, the trustee and the holders of theFloating Rate Notes.
Payments in Euro
All 
payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, is payable in euro. If the euro isunavailable to us due to the 
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the Eu
ropean Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of orwithin the internationa
l banking community, then all payments in respect of th e Notes will be made in dollars until the euro is again available to us or soused. The amount payable on any dat
e in euro is converted into dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any payment in respect of th
e Notes so made in dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture governing the Notes. Neither thetrustee nor the paying agen
t shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with th e foregoing.Issuance of Additional Notes
We may, without the consent of 
the holders of Notes, issue additional Notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity andother terms as a seri
es of the Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and, in some cases, the first interest payment date). Any additionalNotes, together with the Notes with th
e same terms, will constitute a single series of Notes under the Indenture; prov ided that, if the additional Notes are notfungible with the Notes in this of
fering for United States federal income tax purposes, the additional Notes will have different ISIN and CUSIP numbers. Noadditional Notes of 
a series may be issued if an event of default has occurred with respect to that series of Notes.Ranking
The Notes are our unsecured and unsubord
inated obligations. The Notes rank equal in priority with all of our existing and future unsecured andunsubordinated indebtedness and sen
ior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes effectively rank junior toall of our existing and futu
re secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In add ition, because the Notes are onlyour obligation and are not gua
ranteed by our subsidiaries, creditors of each of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and owners of preferred equity ofour subsidiaries, 
generally will have prio rity with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of our creditors, including holders ofthe Notes. The Notes, therefore, 
are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiar ies, and to claims of ownersof preferred equity of ou
r subsidiaries.Redemption

edeemable prior to maturity except upon certain tax events described below. See “Redemption for TaxReasons.”

ther governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of orinterest on any note, if such p
ayment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;(9) to any tax, assessment 
or other governmental ch arge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of any note,where presentation is requ

business or (ii) that is neither (A) buying the Notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Notes for resale to a third-party that either is not a bankor holding the 
Notes for investment purposes only; (11) to any tax, assessment or o
ther governmental charge imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or succ essorprovisions), any current or fu

legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuan t to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementationof such sections of the Code; or
(12) in the case of any comb
ination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).The Notes are subject in al
l cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Notes. Except as specifical
ly provided under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to make any payment for any tax, assessment orother governmental cha
rge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority o f or in any government or political subdivision.As used under this heading “Payment of Addi
tional Amounts” and under the heading “Rede mption for Tax Reasons”, the term “United States”means the United States of Ame
rica, the states of the United States, and the District of Columbia, and the term “United States person” means any individual who is a citizen or residen
t of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organizedin or under the laws of the United St
ates, any state of the United States or the Dist rict of Columbia, or any estate or trust the income of which is subject toUnited States federal in
come taxation regardless of its source.To the extent permitt
ed by law, we maintain a paying agent in a Member State of the European Union (if any) that will not require withholdingor deduction of tax pursuant to Eu
ropean Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, orintroduced in order to confo
rm to, such European Council Directive.Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any chang
e in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (orany taxing authority in the Uni
ted States), or any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws,regulations or rulings, we beco
me or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become ob ligated to pay additional amountsas described under the head
ing “Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to the Notes, then we may at any time at our option redeem, in whole, butnot in part, any series 
of the Notes on not less than 15 nor mor e than 45 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount,together with accrued and unp
aid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.Change of Control Offer to Purchase
If a change of control t
riggering event occurs, holders of Notes may require us to repurchase all or any part (equal to an integral multiple of€1,000) of their Notes at a purch
ase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to the date of purchase(unless, in the case of the 2020, 2023 
and 2027 Notes, a notice of redemption has been mailed within 30 days afte r such change of control triggering eventstating that all of th
e Notes of such series will be redeemed as described above); provided that the principal amount of a Note remaining outstanding after arepurchase in part 
shall be €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. We are required to mail to holders of the Notes a notice describingthe transaction or tr
ansactions constituting the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase the Notes. The noti ce must be mailed within 30days after any change of con
trol triggering event, and the repurchase must occur no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date the notice ismailed.
On the date specified for 
repurchase of the Notes, we will, to the extent lawful: 
 
•  accept for payment all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes; 
 
•  deposit with the paying agent the required payment for all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes; and 
 
• deliver to the trustee the repurchased Notes, accompanied by an officers’ certificate stating, among other things, the aggregate prin cipal amountof repurchased Notes.
We will comply with the requ
irements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchang e Act of 1934, as amended, and any other securities laws andregulations applicabl
e to the repurchase of the Notes. To the extent that these requirements conflict with the provisions requiring repurch ase of the Notes,we will comply with these requi
rements instead of the repurchase provisions and will not
be considered to have breached our obligations with respect to repurchasing the Notes. Additionally, if an event of default exists under the Indenture (whichis unrelated to the repu
rchase provisions of the Notes), including events of default arising with respect to other issues of debt securities, we will not berequired to repurchase 
the Notes notwithstanding these repurchase provisions.We will not be required to 
comply with the obligations relating to repurchasing the Notes if a third party instead satisfies them.For purposes of the repurchase prov
isions of the Notes, the following terms are applicable:“

Sinking FundThe Notes are not subject to, or 
entitled to the benefit of, any sinking fund.Conversion or Exchange Rights
The Notes are not convertibl
e or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or other securities.Certain Restrictive Covenants
The Indenture contains res
trictive covenants that apply the Notes, the most significant of which are described below.Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries
Some of our property may be subje
ct to a mortgage or other legal mechanism that gives our lenders preferential rights in that property overother lenders, including di
rect holders of the Notes, or over our general creditors, if we fail to pay them back. These preferential rights are called “liens.”The Indenture restric
ts our ability to create, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by a mortgage, pledge,lien, security inter
est or other encumbrance on: 
 
• any flour mill, manufacturing or packaging plant or research laboratory located in the United States or Canada owned by us or one of our current or future United St
ates or Canadian operating subsidiaries; or 
 
•  any stock or debt issued by one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiariesunless we also secure all th
e Notes that are still outstanding under the Indenture equally with the indebtedness being secured. This promise does not restrict our ability to sell or oth
erwise dispose of our interests in any United States or Canadian operating subsidiary.These requirements do not app
ly to liens: 
 
•  existing on February 1, 1996 and any extensions, renewals or replacements of those liens; 
 
•  relating to the construction, improvement or purchase of a flour mill, plant or laboratory; 
 
•  in favor of us or one of our United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries; 
 
•  in favor of governmental units for financing construction, improvement or purchase of our property; 
 
• existing on any property, stock or debt existing at the time we acquire it, including liens on property, stock or debt of a United States or Canadian operating subsidiary 
at the time it became our United States or Canadian operating subsidiary; 
 
•  relating to the sale of our property; 
 
•  for work done on our property; 
 
•  relating to workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and similar obligations; 
 
•  relating to litigation or legal judgments; 
 
•  for taxes, assessments or governmental charges not yet due; or 
 
•  consisting of easements or other restrictions, defects in title or encumbrances on our real property.We may also avoid securing 
the Notes equally with the indebtedness being secured if the amount of the indebtedness being secured plus the value of any sale and leas
e back transactions, as described below, is 15% or less than the amount of our consolidated total assets minus our consolidatednon-interest 
bearing current liabilities, as re flected on our consolidated balance sheet.If a merger or other 
transaction would create any liens that are not permitted as describ ed above, we must grant an equivalent lien to the directholders of the Notes.

Limitation on Sale and Leaseback TransactionsThe Indenture also provides th
at we and our United States and Canadian operating subsidiaries will not enter into any sale and leasebacktransactions on any of our flou
rmills, manufacturing or packaging plants or research laboratories located in the United States or Canada owned by us or oneof our current or future Uni
ted States or Canadian operating subsidiaries (“principal properties”) unless we sat isfy some restrictions. A sale and leasebacktransaction involves our sa
le to a lender or other investor of a property of ours and our leasing back that property from that party for more than three years,or a sale of 
a property to, and its leas e back for three or more years from, another person who borrows the necessary funds from a lender or other investor onthe security of the prope
rty.We may enter into a sa
le and leaseback transaction covering any of our principal properties only if: 
 
• it falls into the exceptions for liens described above under “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries”; or
 
 
• within 180 days after the property sale, we set aside for the retirement of funded debt, meaning notes or bonds that mature at or may be extended to a date more 
than 12 months after issuance, an amount equal to the greater of: 
 
•  the net proceeds of the sale of the principal property, or 
 
•  the fair market value of the principal property sold, and in either case, minus 
 
• the principal amount of any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are delivered to the trustee for retirement within 120 days after the property s
ale, and 
 
• the principal amount of any funded debt, other than debt securities issued under the Indenture, voluntarily retired by us within 120 days after the property s
ale; or 
 
• the attributable value, as described below, of all sale and leaseback transactions plus any indebtedness that we incur that, but for the ex ceptionin the second to last parag
raph of “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries” above,would have required us to secure 
the Notes equally with it, is 15% or less than the amount of ou r consolidated total assets minus ourconsolidated 
non-interest bearing current liabilities, as  reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.We determine the a
ttributable value of a sale and leaseback transaction by choosing the lesser of (1) or (2) below: 
        1.
 sale price of the le ased property                 x                  remaining portion of the base 
   term of the lease                 
   the base term of the lease         2.
 
the total obligation of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining portion of the base term of the lease, discounted to presen t value atthe highest interest r
ate on any outstanding series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. The rental payments in this calculation do notinclude amounts for proper
ty taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, water rates and other items that are not payments for the property itself.Mergers and Similar Events
We are generally pe
rmitted under the Indenture to consolidate or merge with another company. We are also permitted to sell or lease some orall 
of our assets to another company. However, we may not take any of these actions unless the following conditions, among others, are met: 
 
• where we merge out of existence or sell or lease substantially all our assets, the other company must be a corporation, limited liability company,partnership or trust organ
ized under the laws of a state or the District of Columbia or under United States federal law and it must expresslyagree in a supplementa
l indenture to be legally responsible for the Notes; and  
 
• the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not bring about a default on the Notes (for purposes of this test, a default would includ e anevent of default descr
ibed below under “Default and Related Matters” and any event that would be an event of default if the requirements forgiving us notice of our defaul
t or our default having to exist for a specific period of time  were disregarded).
There is no precise, established definition of what would constitute a sale or lease of substantially all of our assets under applicable law and,accordingly, there may b
e uncertainty as to whether a sale or lease of less than all of our assets would subject us to this provision.If we merge out of existen
ce or transfer (except through a lease) substantially all our assets, and the other firm becomes our successor and is legally responsible for 
the Notes, we will be relieved of our own responsibility for the Notes.Default and Related Matters
Noteholders will have specia
l rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term “event of default” means any of the following:
 
 
•  we do not pay interest on a Note of that series within 30 days of its due date; 
 
•  we do not pay the principal or any premium on a Note of that series on its due date; 
 
• we do not deposit money into a separate custodial account, known as a sinking fund, when such a deposit is due, if we agree to maintain a sinking fund with respect to tha
t series; 
 
• we remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after we rece ive anotice of default sta
ting we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or direct holders of at least 25% of the principal amountof Notes of the affected s
eries); or 
 
•  we file for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.In the event of our bankruptcy, 
insolvency or other similar proceeding, all of the Notes will automatically be due and immediately payable. If a non-bankruptcy 
event of default has occu rred with respect to any series of Notes and has not been cured, the trustee or the direct holders of not less than25% in principal amount of 
the Notes of the affected series may declare the entire  principal amount of all the Notes of that series to be due and immediatelypayable. This is called
 a “declaration of acceleration of maturity.”A declaration of acce
leration of maturity may be canceled by the direct holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes of theaffected series i
f any other defaults on those Notes have been waived or cured and we pay or deposit with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay thefollowing with respect to the Not
es of that series: 
 
•  all overdue interest; 
 
•  principal and premium, if any, which has become due, other than as a result of the acceleration, plus any interest on that principal;  
 
•  interest on overdue interest, to the extent that payment is lawful; and 
 
•  amounts paid or advanced by the trustee and reasonable trustee compensation and expenses.Except in cases of defaul
t, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the Indenture at the request of any direct h
olders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability, called an “indemnity.” If reasonableindemnity is provided, the di
rect holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of the re levant series may direct the time, method andplace of conducting an
y lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. These majority direct holders may also direct thetrustee in 
exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee under the Indenture.Before an investor may bypass th
e trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce its rights orprotect its interes
ts relating to any Notes of any series, the following must occur: 
 
• the investor must give the trustee written notice that an event of default with respect to the Notes of that series has occurred and r emainsuncured;

 • the direct holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Notes of that series must make a written request that th e trustee takeaction because of the de
fault, and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against any cost and liabilities of taking that action; 
 
• the trustee must not have received from direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series a direction inconsistent with the writt
en notice; and 
 
•  the trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.However, investors are entit
led at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on a Note on or after its due date. Every year we will certi
fy in a written statement to the trustee that we are in compliance with the Indenture and each series of Notes or specify any default that we know about.
Defeasance
The Floating Rate Notes are not subj
ect to defeasance or covenant defeasance. In some circumstances described below, we may elect todischarge 
our obligations on the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes through d efeasance or covenant defeasance.Full Defeasance
If there is a change in Uni
ted States federal tax law as described below, we could legally release ourselves from any payment or otherobligations on the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes, cal
led “full defeasance,” if we put in place the following arrangements for investors to be repaid: 
 
• we must irrevocably deposit in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of those Notes money or specified German government securi ties or acombination of these tha
t will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on those Notes on their various duedates;
 
 
• there must be a change in current federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us make the deposit without causing investors to be taxed on the Notes any diff
erently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid such Notes ourselves (under current UnitedStates federal tax l
aw, the deposit and our legal release from the such Notes would be treated as though we took back su ch Notes and gaveinvestors their share of 
the cash and notes or bonds deposited in trust, in which case investors could recognize gain or loss on those Notes); and 
 
•  we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming the United States tax law change described above.In addition, no default must h
ave occurred and be continuing with respect to those Notes at the time the deposit is made (and, with respect only to bankruptcy and similar 
events, during the 90 days following the deposit), and we have delivered a certificate and a legal opinion to the effect that thedeposit does not:
 
 
•  cause any outstanding Notes to be delisted; 
 
•  cause the trustee to have a “conflicting interest” within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;  
 
• result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which we are party or by which we are bound; and
 
 
• result in the trust arising from it constituting an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (unless we register the trust, or 
find an exemption from registration, under that Act).If we ever did accomplish 
full defeasance, investors would have to rely solely on the trust deposit, and could no longer look to us, forrepayment on the Notes of the 
affected series. Conversely, the trust deposit would likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if weever become bankrupt or inso
lvent.Covenant Defeasance
Under current United States f
ederal tax law, we can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from many of the covenantsin 
the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes. This is called “covenant defeasance.” In that event, investors would lose the
protection of those covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the applicable series of Notes. In orderto achieve covenant def
easance, we must do the following:  
 
•  make the same deposit of money and/or German government securities described above under “— Full Defeasance;”  
 
• deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that under current United States federal income tax law we may make the above deposit without causing investors to be t
axed on the applicable series of Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid theapplicable series of Not
es ourselves; and 
 
•  comply with the other conditions precedent described above under “— Full Defeasance.”If we accomplish covenant d
efeasance, the following provisions, among others, would no longer apply: 
 
•  the events of default relating to breach of covenants described below under “Default and Related Matters;” and  
 
• any promises regarding conduct of our business, such as those described under “Certain Restrictive Covenants” below and any other covenan tsapplicable to the ser
ies of Notes.If we accomplish covenant d
efeasance, investors can still look to us for repayment of the applicable series of Notes if there is a shortfall in thetrust deposit. Depending on the even
t causing the default, however, investors may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.Modification and Waiver
There are three types o
f changes we can make to the Indenture and the Notes.First, there are changes 
that cannot be made to the Notes without specific investor approval. These include: 
 
•  change of the stated due date for payment of principal or interest on a series of Notes; 
 
•  reduction in the principal amount of, the rate of interest payable on or any premium payable upon redemption of a series of Notes;  
 
•  reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a series of Notes following a default;  
 
•  change in the place or currency of payment on a series of Notes; 
 
•  impairment of an investor’s right to sue for payment on a series of Notes on or after the due date for such payment;  
 
•  reduction in the percentage of direct holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required to modify or amend the Indenture;  
 
• reduction in the percentage of holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required under the Indenture to waive compliance with provis ionsof, or to waive defaults under, 
the Indenture; and 
 
• modification of any of the provisions described above or other provisions of the Indenture dealing with waiver of defaults or covenants under the Indenture, except to 
increase the percentages required for such waivers or to provide that other provisions of the Indenture cannot bechanged without the consent of e
ach direct holder affected by the change.Second, changes may be made by us and th
e trustee without any vote by holders of any series of Notes. These include: 
 
•  evidencing the assumption by a successor of our obligations under the Indenture and any series of Notes; 
 
•  adding to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of Notes, or surrendering any of our rights or powers under the Indenture;  
 
•  adding other events of default for the benefit of holders of any series of Notes; 
 
•  making such changes as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of any series of Notes in bearer or uncertificated form; 
 •  establishing the forms or terms of any series of Notes; 
 
•  evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee; and 
 
• curing any ambiguity, correcting any Indenture provision that may be defective or inconsistent with other Indenture provisions or making anyother change that does not adv
ersely affect the interests of the holders of any series of Notes in any material respect.Third, we need a vote by direct ho
lders of Notes owning at least a majority of the principal amount of each series affected by the change tomake any other change to th
e Indenture that is not of the type described in the preceding two paragraphs. A majority vote of this kind is also required toobtain a waiver of any past de
fault, except a payment default on principal or interest or concerning a provision of the Indenture that cannot be changedwithout the consent of the dir
ect holder.When taking a vote, we will 
decide how much principal a mount to attribute to a series of Notes by using the dollar equivalent, as determined byour Board of Directors.
Notes will not be considered outst
anding, and therefore will not be eligible to vote, if owned by us or one of our affiliates or if we havedeposited or set aside money 
in trust for their payment or redemption. Notes will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as describedbelow under “Defeasance — Full Def
easance.”We will generally be en
titled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the direct holders of outstanding Notes that areentitled to vote or tak
e other action under the Indenture. In some circumstances, generally related to a default by us on a series of the Notes, the trustee willbe entitled to set a r
ecord date for action by holders.Trustee
U.S. Bank 
National Association, as trust ee under the Indenture, has been appointed by us as paying agent and registrar with regard to the Notes.The trustee also acts as 
an agent for the issuance of our United States commercial paper. The trustee and its affiliates currently provide cas h managementand other banking and advisory serv
ices to us in the normal course of business and may from time to time in the future provide other banking and advisoryservices to us in the ordina
ry course of business, in each case in exchange for a fee.Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Note
We have obtained the info
rmation in this section concerning Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of th
e Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe tobe reliable. We tak
e no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addi tion, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflectsour understanding of the rules 
and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they were in effect at the time of the issuance of the Notes of each series. Those clearing systems could 
change their rules and procedures at any time.The Notes are represented by on
e or more fully registered global notes. E ach such global note is deposited with, or on behalf of, a commondepositary, and register
ed in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below,the 
global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. Investors may hold interests inthe global notes in Europe through Cl
earstream or Euroclear, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly th rough organizations that are participantsin such systems. Clearstrea
m and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customersthrough customers’ 
securities accounts in Cl earstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the Notesand all transfers relating to
 the Notes are reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear. The distribution of the Notes is 
cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the Notes takes place through 
Clearstream and Euroclear participants and settles in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the Notes receive paymentsrelating to their Notes 
in euro, except as described under the heading “Payments in Euro.”Clearstream and Euroclear ha
ve established electronic securities and payment transfer, proc essing, depositary and custodial links amongthemselves and others, ei
ther directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the Notes to be issued, held and transferred among theclearing systems without th
e physical transfer of certificates.  Special procedures to facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among theseclearing systems to trade 
securities across borders in the secondary market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the i nvestor’s interest in theNotes held by them. We have no respons
ibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants.We also do not supervise 
these systems in any way. Clearstream and Euroclear an
d their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they have m ade with oneanother or with their custo
mers. Investors should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to perform these procedures and may modifythem or discontinue them 
at any time.Except as provided below, owners of bene
ficial interests in the Notes will not be entitled to have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entit
led to receive physical delivery of the Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under theIndenture, including for purpos
es of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Acco rdingly, each person owning abeneficial inter
est in a Note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participantthrough which such person owns 
its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes.We have been advised by Clears
tream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows: Clearstream
Clearstream advises th
at it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for itsparticipating organizations (“
Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between ClearstreamParticipants through ele
ctronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby e liminating the need for physical movement ofcertificates. Clearstream provides
 to Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement ofinternationally traded 
securities and securi ties lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professionaldepositary, Clearstrea
m is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveill ancedu Secteur Financier). Clea
rstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,banks, trust companies, cle
aring corporations and certain other organizations a nd may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is alsoavailable to others, such 
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a ClearstreamParticipant, either directly or
 indirectly.Distributions with respect to 
interests in the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream are credited to cash accounts of ClearstreamParticipants in accord
ance with its rules and procedures.Euroclear
Euroclear advises that it 
was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroc
lear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physicalmovement of certificates and an
y risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroc lear includes various other services, includingsecurities lending and bor
rowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the“Euroclear 
Operator”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accountsare accounts with the Euroc
lear Operator. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and otherprofessional financial intermediarie
s and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through ormaintain a custodial 
relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.The Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroc
lear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclea r System, or the Euroclear Termsand Conditions, and applicable Belg
ian law govern securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Specifically, these termsand conditions govern:
 
 
•  transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear; 
 
•  withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear; and 
 
•  receipt of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear.All securities in Euroclear
 are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator ac
ts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holdingsecurities through Eurocl
ear Participants.
Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear are credited to the cash a ccounts of EuroclearParticipants in accord
ance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions.Clearance and 
Settlement Procedures We understand that investo
rs that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement procedures that are applicable to convention
al eurobonds in registered form. Notes are credited to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear participants onthe business day following the set
tlement date, for value on the settlement date. They are  credited either free of payment or against payment for value on thesettlement date.
We understand that 
secondary market trad ing between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way following theapplicable rules and ope
rating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered for
m.Investors should be aware that 
investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and o ther communications involving theNotes through Clearstream and Eu
roclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days whenbanks, brokers and other institu
tions are open for business in the United Stat es.In addition, because of ti
me-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Eu roclear on thesame business day as in the United St
ates. United States investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment ordelivery of the Notes, on a par
ticular day, may find that the transactions wi ll not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,depending on whether Clearstre
am or Euroclear is used.Clearstream or Euroclear will
 credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, inaccordance with the relevant
 system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case maybe, will take any other ac
tion permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a Clearstre am customer or Euroclear participant only inaccordance with its re
levant rules and procedures.Clearstream and 
Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants ofClearstream and Eurocl
ear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time.
Certificated Notes
If the depositary for any o
f the Notes of any series represented by a registered global note is at any time unwilling or unable to continue asdepositary and a successor depos
itary is not appointed by us within 90 days, we will issue Notes of that series in definitive form in exchange for theregistered global note 
that had been held by the depositary. Any Notes issued in definitive form in exchange for a regist ered global note will be registered inthe name or names that 
the depositary gives to the trustee or other relevant agent of the trustee. It is expected that the depositary’s instructions will be basedupon directions 
received by the deposita ry from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global note that had been heldby the depositary. In addition, we 
may at any time determine that the Notes of any series shall no longer be represented by a global no te and will issue Notesof such series in definit
ive form in exchange for such global note pursuant to the procedure described above.
