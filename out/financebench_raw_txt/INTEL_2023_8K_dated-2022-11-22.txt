Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
As previously disclosed, on August 22, 2022, Intel Corporation (“Intel,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and Arizona Fab HoldCo Inc. (“Intel HoldCo”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Intel, entered into a purchase and contribution agreement (the “Purchase and Contribution Agreement”) with Foundry JV Holdco LLC
(“Brookfield”), an entity formed at the direction of and managed by certain affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., and Arizona Fab LLC (“NewCo”), a
wholly owned, newly formed subsidiary of Brookfield, for the joint ownership of NewCo which will, among other things, own and maintain two semiconductor
wafer fabrication buildings located on Intel’s Ocotillo campus in the State of Arizona.
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the “Closing”) was subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions precedent, including receipt of required CFIUS approvals. On November 22, 2022, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions of the Purchase
and Contribution Agreement, Intel and the parties thereto consummated the Closing.
In connection with the Closing, under the Purchase and Contribution Agreement and the LLC Agreement, and subject to their respective terms and conditions,
(i) Intel acquired 51% of the fully diluted equity interests of NewCo (the “Units”), and Brookfield continued to own 49% of the Units; (ii) Intel contributed to
NewCo certain assets and work-in-progress related to the Arizona Project equal to approximately $1.3 billion and, when taken together with Intel’s commitment
for future contributions, will be $14.8 billion in the aggregate, (iii) Brookfield contributed to NewCo approximately $0.8 billion in cash and, when taken together
with Brookfield’s commitments for future contributions, will be $14.8 billion in the aggregate, and thereafter (iv) Intel contributed all of its Units to Intel HoldCo,
which at such time became the majority member of NewCo.
In connection with the Closing, Intel HoldCo and Brookfield entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of NewCo (the “LLC
Agreement”) in substantially the form previously attached to the Purchase and Contribution Agreement and described in Intel’s Current Report on Form 8-K,
dated August 23, 2022.
The LLC Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report and incorporated by this reference.

Section 1.9 Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the
Company dated as of August 8, 2022.
ARTICLE 2
MEMBERSHIP, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND UNITS
Section 2.1 Members. Schedule 2.1 shall contain (a) a current list of Members, (b) the total amount of Capital Contributions (whether in cash or
in-kind) made by, or deemed to be made by, each Member, (c) the Fair Value of any in-kind property contributed to the Company, (d) the number of
Units held by each Member and (e) the commitment to make Capital Contributions (delineated between cash and then-known in-kind) of each Member
set forth in the Project Execution Plan (as applicable to each Member, its “Budgeted Capital Commitment”). Schedule 2.1 reflects, as of the date hereof,
(i) the Capital Contributions made (or deemed made) by the Members on or prior to the date hereof in accordance with the Contribution Agreement and
(ii) the remaining unfunded Budgeted Capital Commitments of the Members. A Member may make Additional Capital Contributions at any time with
the written consent of the Board and in compliance with Section 2.6. To the extent that a Member makes any approved Additional Capital Contribution
to the Company (whether in cash or in-kind), the Board shall revise Schedule 2.1 to reflect such Capital Contribution (including an increase in the total
Capital Contributions of the contributing Member equal to the Fair Value of such Additional Capital Contribution, an update to the Fair Value of in-kind
property, if applicable, and a decrease in the remaining unfunded Budgeted Capital Commitment of such Member).
Section 2.2 Units. The interests of the Members in the Company will be divided into one class of units referred to as the “Units”. Each Unit will
represent an ownership interest in the Company, will be designated as a Unit of the Company and will be entitled to the Distributions provided for in
Article 4. Fractional Units are hereby expressly permitted.
Section 2.3 Specific Limitations. No Member will have the right or power to: (a) withdraw or reduce its Capital Contribution except as provided
by the Act or in this Agreement, (b) make voluntary Capital Contributions, except as permitted by the Board in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (c) contribute any property to the Company other than cash, except as otherwise permitted by the Board (including the EPC
Work-in-Progress and the Lease Agreement) or as otherwise set forth in the Contribution Agreement (including those in-kind contributions made by, or
deemed to be made by, the Intel Member as of the date hereof) and valued at Fair Value, (d) bring an action for partition against the Company or any
Company assets, (e) except as set forth in this Agreement or as required by the Act, cause the winding up and dissolution of the Company, (f) require
that property other than cash be distributed upon any Distribution or (g) notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 18-402 of the Act, bind the
Company acting as a single Member.
 
3
Section 2.4 Additional Units. Other than in accordance with Section 2.6(d) and Section 6.4, but without limiting Article 10, the Board shall not
issue any additional Units in the Company. Promptly following the issuance of any additional Units, the Board shall cause the books and records of the
Company to reflect the number of Units issued, the Members holding such Units and the kind and Fair Value of any Capital Contribution on account
thereof. Upon the execution of this Agreement or counterpart of this Agreement and any other documents or instruments required by the Board in
connection therewith and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the making of the Capital Contribution (if any) specified to be made at
such time, a Person shall be admitted to the Company as a Member of the Company and the Board shall amend Schedule 2.1 to reflect any such
admittance, contribution and issuance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Intel Member own or otherwise
be entitled to less than 51% of the outstanding Units at any time without the Intel Member’s prior written consent.
Section 2.5 Capital Contributions. Each Member’s Capital Contribution, whether in cash or in-kind, shall be made in accordance with this
Section 2.5 and Section 2.6. Other than in accordance with Section 2.6(d) and Section 6.4, no additional Units shall be issued in connection with any
Capital Contribution made by a Member in respect of its Budgeted Capital Contributions or Unbudgeted Capital Contributions (including any
Additional Brookfield Contributions). Any in-kind Capital Contributions shall be effected by a written assignment or such other documents as the Board
shall direct. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable assignment or contribution agreement, any Member making an in-kind Capital
Contribution agrees from time to time to take such further acts and execute such further documents as the Board may reasonably request to perfect the
Company’s interest in such in-kind Capital Contribution. The Members acknowledge that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, certain
in-kind benefits directly or indirectly contractually provided to the Company by the Intel Member or any Affiliate thereof may be deemed to be Capital
Contributions of the Intel Member, valued at Fair Value, notwithstanding the fact that title to or direct ownership of such benefits or in-kind assets may
not be transferrable to the Company. The Members further acknowledge that Intel Member’s in-kind contributions to the Company, and certain
Company assets, shall be structured in a manner intended to facilitate the development, ownership and operation by Intel and its Affiliates of additional
properties in the vicinity of the Arizona Fab; provided, that no such structuring shall impair, limit, restrict or prohibit the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof in any manner that is material and adverse to the operation of its business in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any in-kind Capital Contribution that would have the effect of causing the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to take any of
the actions set forth on Schedule 6.4 shall require the approval of a majority of the Board (whether acting at a meeting or by written consent), which
majority must include at least one Brookfield Manager.
 
4
Section 2.6 Additional Capital Contributions.
(a) Generally. In addition to the initial Capital Contributions of each Member, each Member shall make Additional Capital Contributions
from time to time as set forth in a Capital Call made in accordance with this Section 2.6. In the case of the Brookfield Member, all Additional Capital
Contributions shall be funded in cash. In the case of the Intel Member, Capital Contributions and Additional Capital Contributions may be funded in
cash or as in-kind contributions (valued at such in-kind contribution’s Fair Value) in accordance with Section 2.5; provided, that no in-kind Capital
Contribution by the Intel Member shall be deemed to reduce Intel Member’s remaining unfunded Budgeted Capital Commitment below the amount
required to be funded by the Intel Member hereunder in respect of remaining payments due under the EPC Contract. Upon the Board determining to
make a capital call for Additional Capital Contributions in accordance with this Section 2.6 (a “Capital Call”), the Board shall deliver to the Members a
written notice of the Company’s need for Additional Capital Contributions, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail (i) the purpose for such
Additional Capital Contributions and whether such Additional Capital Contributions (or any portion thereof) constitute (A) a Budgeted Capital
Contribution (including a notification of the Board’s election to deem such Additional Capital Contribution a Budgeted Capital Contribution in
accordance with Section 2.6(e)(ii)), together with a reasonably detailed description of the amount of any Excess Payment Credits that result in such
Additional Capital Contribution being deemed a Budgeted Capital Contribution or (B) an Unbudgeted Capital Contribution, (ii) the aggregate amount of
such Additional Capital Contributions, (iii) each Member’s share of such aggregate amount of Additional Capital Contributions as determined in
accordance with this Section 2.6, (iv) if applicable, in the case of the Intel Member, the form of property (e.g., cash, assets, land or other rights) that may
be contributed by the Intel Member to fund its portion of such Additional Capital Contributions and the Fair Value of any property other than cash that
may be contributed by the Intel Member in connection therewith, (v) the date, which date shall not be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date that
such notice is given, on which such Additional Capital Contributions shall be required to be made by the Members and (vi) the Transfer Balance of such
Member.
(b) Scheduled Construction Contributions. The Board may issue Capital Calls from time to time to the Members requesting that such
Members make Additional Capital Contributions (i) in such amounts and on or after the contemplated contribution date as set forth in the Project
Execution Plan, which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $28,982,302,000, or (ii) as otherwise approved unanimously by the Members (each,
a “Scheduled Construction Contribution”); provided that in no event shall a Capital Call issued for a Scheduled Construction Contribution pursuant to
clause (i) request an Additional Capital Contribution to be made on any day following the Longstop Date. Each Member shall be obligated to fund its
Original Pro Rata Share of any Additional Capital Contributions set forth in a Capital Call issued in accordance with Section 2.6(a) and this
Section 2.6(b). For the avoidance of doubt, (A) amounts contributed by the Brookfield Member on the date hereof pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement shall be deemed Scheduled Construction Contributions made in accordance with the Project Execution Plan, (B) the amount that is (1) the
aggregate amount of Scheduled Construction Contributions called by the Board pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) plus (2) without duplication, the amount
contributed by the Brookfield Member on the date hereof pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, shall not, at the time such Scheduled Construction
Contribution is required to be funded pursuant to the applicable Capital Call, exceed the aggregate amount set forth for such date in the Project
Execution Plan unless unanimously approved by the Members and (C) the remaining unfunded Budgeted Capital Commitments of each Member will be
reduced dollar-for-dollar for all Scheduled Construction Contributions actually made (including those made on the date hereof in accordance with the
Contribution Agreement or made on or after the date hereof pursuant to a Transfer Election).
 
5
(c) Overrun Contributions. The Board shall issue a Capital Call requesting the Brookfield Member to make an Additional Capital
Contribution equal to the Overrun Commitments on or after the date contemplated by the Project Execution Plan (the “Overrun Contribution” and,
together with the Scheduled Construction Contributions, the “Budgeted Capital Contributions”); provided, that in no event shall a Capital Call issued for
the Overrun Contribution request such contribution to be made on any day following the Longstop Date. The Brookfield Member shall be obligated to
fund 100% of any Overrun Contribution set forth in a Capital Call issued in accordance with Section 2.6(a) and this Section 2.6(c). For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) no Additional Capital Contribution will be required from the Intel Member pursuant to the Capital Call issued for the Overrun Contribution
and (ii) the remaining unfunded Budgeted Capital Commitments of the Brookfield Member will be reduced for all Overrun Contributions made by the
Brookfield Member.
(d) Brookfield Member Default. If the Brookfield Member shall fail to timely make (or, if earlier, as of the date that the Brookfield
Member notifies the Company or Intel Member in writing that it will not make) all or any portion of any Budgeted Capital Contribution as contemplated
by a Capital Call issued in accordance with Section 2.6(b), Section 2.6(c) or Section 2.6(e), in each case, which the Brookfield Member is required to
make pursuant to Section 2.6(b), Section 2.6(c) or Section 2.6(e), as applicable, then the Intel Member shall be entitled, but not obligated, to, without
limitation of any other rights or remedies that may be available:
(i) institute proceedings against the Brookfield Member, either in the Intel Member’s own name or on behalf of the Company, to
obtain payment of such Scheduled Construction Contributions or Overrun Contributions, as applicable, to the extent that the Brookfield Member
fails to contribute all or any portion of such Scheduled Construction Contributions or Overrun Contributions (such amount not contributed, the
“Unfunded Amount”), together with interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum from the date that such Scheduled Construction Contributions
or Overrun Contributions, as applicable, were due in accordance with the applicable Capital Call and this Section 2.6 until the date that an
Additional Capital Contribution in respect thereof is made, at the cost and expense of the Brookfield Member;
(ii) following written notice by the Company to the Brookfield Member (with the Intel Member in copy) notifying the Brookfield
Member of its failure to fund all or any amount due from the Brookfield Member in connection with such Capital Call and the terms of
Section 2.6(b), Section 2.6(c) or Section 2.6(e), as applicable, and the Brookfield Member’s failing to cure such breach within sixty (60) calendar
days of such notice by funding the Unfunded Amount, make an Additional Capital Contribution on behalf of the Brookfield Member up to the
Unfunded Amount (a “Cram-Down Contribution”). At the time of any Cram-Down Contribution, (A) the Company shall issue to the Intel
Member a number of additional Units (the “Cram-Down Units”) equal to (1) the
 
6
Adjusted Intel Units minus (2) the number of Units held by the Intel Member immediately prior to such Cram-Down Contribution and (B) the
Board shall revise Schedule 2.1 to reflect the issuance of such Cram-Down Units by the Company to the Intel Member and the increase in the
Capital Contributions of the Intel Member (and the corresponding decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the Budgeted Capital Commitment of
the Brookfield Member); or
(iii) following written notice by the Intel Member to the Brookfield Member and the Brookfield Member’s failing to cure within
sixty (60) calendar days of such notice, exercise the Intel Call Right as a Brookfield Default Call pursuant to Section 12.7.
(e) Unbudgeted Capital Contributions. In the event the Company has any Company Net Liabilities that are not otherwise paid or to be paid
with Extraordinary Proceeds received by the Company before such Company Net Liabilities become due and payable prior to the O&M Agreement
Initial Term Date, or to the extent that the Board determines that any Capital Contribution is necessary or advisable, in each case, other than with respect
to costs included in the Project Execution Plan (collectively, “Unbudgeted Costs”), the Board shall issue (and the Intel Member shall cause the Intel
Manager to approve) a Capital Call for such Unbudgeted Costs (an “Unbudgeted Capital Call”); provided, that (x) the Brookfield Member shall not be
required to fund any Unbudgeted Costs unless (A) it so elects pursuant to Section 2.6(e)(i) or (B) it is required to fund in accordance with Section 2.6(e)
(ii) (any such amount funded by the Brookfield Member pursuant to clause (A) or (B), the “Additional Brookfield Contribution”) and (y) the Intel
Member shall be required to fund all of any such Unbudgeted Capital Call, other than the Additional Brookfield Contribution (such amounts contributed
by the Intel Member, “Unbudgeted Capital Contributions”); provided, further, that with respect to any Company Net Liability that is not otherwise paid
or to be paid with Extraordinary Proceeds received by the Company before such Company Net Liabilities become due and payable, the Intel Member
shall fund the Unbudgeted Capital Contributions in respect thereof prior to or as of the date on which such Company Net Liability becomes due and
payable.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(e)(ii), the Brookfield Member shall be entitled, but not required, to elect to fund up to
its Pro Rata Share of any Unbudgeted Costs set forth in an Unbudgeted Capital Call by delivering written notice to the Company of such election
(including the amount to be funded by the Brookfield Member) no later than five (5) Business Days following the Brookfield Member’s receipt of
such Unbudgeted Capital Call; provided, that if the Brookfield Member does not deliver any such written notice in the timeframe provided, then
the Brookfield Member shall be deemed to have waived its rights to fund any portion of such Unbudgeted Capital Call.
(ii) If, at the time the Board issues an Unbudgeted Capital Call for any Unbudgeted Costs, there exist Excess Payment Credits under
the O&M Agreement, then at the written election of the Intel Managers set forth in the applicable Capital Call, a portion of the Unbudgeted Costs
in an amount equal to such Excess Payment Credits shall be deemed a Budgeted Capital Contribution (the “Deemed Budgeted Contribution”), and
each Member shall be obligated to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Deemed Budgeted Contribution as set forth in the applicable Capital Call issued
in accordance with Section 2.6(a) and this Section 2.6(e)(ii).
 
7
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Additional Brookfield Contribution or Deemed Budgeted Contribution made pursuant to this
Section 2.6(e) shall not reduce the Budgeted Capital Commitment of the Brookfield Member.
Section 2.7 Certification. In the event that certificates representing Units in the Company are issued, such certificates will bear the following
legend:
“THE UNITS OR OTHER INTERESTS REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED ON [DATE OF
ISSUANCE], HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), OR
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS (“STATE ACTS”) AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR STATE ACTS OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
THEREUNDER. THE TRANSFER OF THE UNITS REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS
SPECIFIED IN A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 22, 2022, AS IT MAY BE AMENDED
FROM TIME TO TIME, GOVERNING THE ISSUER (THE “COMPANY”) AND BY AND AMONG CERTAIN MEMBERS. A COPY OF
SUCH AGREEMENT SHALL BE FURNISHED BY THE COMPANY TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST AND
WITHOUT CHARGE.”
Section 2.8 Intellectual Property.
(a) Any right, title and interest in and to any Intellectual Property developed, created, conceived or reduced to practice by or on behalf of
the Company, and for which ownership is not otherwise expressly addressed in the EPC Contract, the Administrative Services Agreement, the Wafer
Supply Agreement or the O&M Agreement (“Company-Created IP”) shall be solely owned by the Intel Member. To the extent any right, title or interest
in or to such Company-Created IP may vest with the Company, the Brookfield Member or any Member other than the Intel Member, each of the
Company, Brookfield Member and such other Member hereby
 
8
irrevocably transfers and assigns to the Intel Member all right, title and interest, and all other incidents of ownership, in and to such Company-Created
IP. If the Company, the Brookfield Member or any Member other than the Intel Member maintains any rights to the Company-Created IP that cannot be
assigned to the Intel Member as a matter of Law, then the Company or such Member, as applicable, hereby grants to the Intel Member an exclusive,
irrevocable, perpetual, paid-up, royalty free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), worldwide license with respect to any such rights, for
any and all purposes and through any and all means, now known or hereafter created or discovered, without restriction or obligation. (including no
obligation to account). In addition to the foregoing, for clarity, none of the Company, the Brookfield Member or any Member other than the Intel
Member (or their respective Representatives) shall have any right, title or interest in or to any Company-Created IP, without limiting the Intel Member’s
(or its Affiliate’s) contractual obligations pursuant to the EPC Contract or the O&M Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (and without limiting the Members’ inspection rights regarding books of
account and records under Section 8.4 of this Agreement), no Intellectual Property owned by, purported to be owned by, or licensed to the Intel Member
or its Affiliates or subcontractors, including with respect to any Company-Created IP (collectively, “Intel IP”), will be disclosed, provided, transferred,
or licensed to, or accessed by, the Company or any Member (other than the Intel Member), and neither the Company nor any Member (other than the
Intel Member) is acquiring or receiving any right, title or interest therein or thereto. In addition to the foregoing, no Intel IP (nor any right, title or
interest therein) may be encumbered by the Company or any Member, and will in all circumstances remain the sole and exclusive property of the Intel
Member or its applicable Affiliate.
(c) For clarity, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no license, immunity, release, interest, authorization, or other
right, title or interest is granted or otherwise conveyed under this Agreement, whether directly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, by the Intel
Member or any of its Affiliates or any subcontractor, nor is any of the foregoing acquired by the Company or any Member (other than the Intel
Member). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as a warranty or representation by the Intel Member (or any of its Affiliates or
subcontractors) regarding Intellectual Property, including as to the validity, enforceability, quality, scope, or sufficiency of any Intellectual Property, and
all warranties and representations, express, implied or otherwise, are hereby disclaimed. The Intel Member shall have no obligation hereunder to
prosecute, maintain, defend, enforce or otherwise assert any Intellectual Property, all of which will be controlled by the Intel Member in its sole and
absolute discretion.
(d) The Members acknowledge that Intellectual Property is valuable and unique, and that damages would be an inadequate remedy for
breach of this Section 2.8 and the obligations of the Brookfield Member or any Member other than the Intel Member under this Section 2.8 are
specifically enforceable. Accordingly, the Intel Member shall be entitled to seek equitable relief solely to cause the Brookfield Member or any Member
other than the Intel Member to take action, or refrain from taking action, pursuant to this Section 2.8. Any such relief shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, monetary damages or other rights and remedies that may be available to the Intel Member at Law or in equity, subject to Section 5.1.

ARTICLE 3
CAPITAL ACCOUNTS
Section 3.1 Capital Accounts. A separate account (each, a “Capital Account”) shall be established and maintained for each Member which:
(a) shall be increased by (i) the amount of any Capital Contribution (including, for clarity, any Cram-Down Contributions or Unbudgeted
Capital Contributions but excluding any deemed Capital Contribution due to (A) a Transfer Election or (B) a transfer from the Incentive Account to the
Construction Account) by such Member to the Company; (ii) such Member’s share of the Net Profit (or, to the extent provided under Section 4.5(b),
items thereof) of the Company determined in accordance with Section 4.5(b); (iii) any other increases required by the Code and the Treasury
Regulations; and (iv) in the case of the Intel Member, to the extent not otherwise provided pursuant to clause (ii) above, the amount of any Economic
Incentives funded in cash to the Incentive Account; and
(b) shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any Distribution to such Member; (ii) proceeds distributed upon redemption of Units by the
Company; (iii) such Member’s Pro Rata Share of the Net Loss (or, to the extent provided under Section 4.5(b), items thereof) of the Company
determined in accordance with Section 4.5(b); and (iv) any other decreases required by the Code and the Treasury Regulations.
In determining the amount of any liability as provided by the Code and the Treasury Regulations for purposes of sub-clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) above,
there shall be taken into account Section 752 of the Code and any other applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. It is
the intention of the Members that the Capital Accounts of the Company be maintained in accordance with the provisions of Section 704(b) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that this Agreement be interpreted consistently therewith, and the Partnership Representative may adjust
the provisions herein to reflect such intention.
Section 3.2 Revaluations of Assets and Capital Account Adjustments. Immediately preceding the issuance of additional Units in exchange for
cash, other property, or services to a Member, upon the redemption of the Unit of a Member or the liquidation of the Company, the Board shall (subject
to Section 6.4) cause the Company, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), to adjust the then prevailing Asset Values of
the Company to equal their respective gross Fair Value, and any increase in the net equity value of the Company (Asset Values less Liabilities) shall be
credited to the Capital Accounts of the Members in the same manner as Net Profits are credited under Section 4.5(b) (or any decrease in the net equity
value of the Company shall be charged in the same manner as Net Losses are charged under Section 4.5(b)); provided, however, any adjustments made
pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be made only if the Board reasonably determines that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the
relative economic interests of the Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Members that the Company shall (without any
action by the Board) adjust Asset Values in accordance with the foregoing sentence in connection with any deemed or actual contributions or
distributions relating to any Economic Incentives and upon the liquidation of the Company. Accordingly, as of any time Asset Values are adjusted
pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Capital Accounts of Members will reflect both realized and unrealized gains and losses through such date and the net
equity value of the Company as of such date.
 
10
Section 3.3 Additional Capital Account Provisions. Any return of the Capital Contributions of any Member shall be made solely from the assets of
the Company and only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Other than with respect to Priority Distributions, no interest shall be paid to any
Member with respect to such Member’s Capital Contributions or Capital Account. In the event that all or a portion of the Units of a Member are
transferred in accordance with this Agreement, the transferee of such Units shall also succeed to all or the relevant portion of the Capital Account of the
transferor, and shall be treated as having made any Capital Contributions, and received any Distributions, made or received with respect to such
transferred Units while such Units were held by the transferor. Units held by a Member may not be transferred independently of the membership interest
in the Company to which the Units relate.
ARTICLE 4
DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS OF PROFIT AND LOSS
Section 4.1 Separate Accounts and Distributions.
(a) Construction Account. Solely until all amounts required to be paid under the EPC Contract are paid, the Company shall maintain a
construction account (the “Construction Account”) separate from each of the Operating Account, the Incentive Account and the Extraordinary Proceeds
Account. The Construction Account shall be funded with all cash contributed by the Brookfield Member and Intel Member on the date hereof pursuant
to the Contribution Agreement, all Budgeted Capital Contributions and all other Capital Contributions made to the Company by the Members pursuant
to a Capital Call for the purpose of making payments or satisfying obligations under the EPC Contract, including if applicable (i) amounts transferred
into the Construction Account from the Incentive Account at the instruction of the Intel Member pursuant to Section 4.1(d) and (ii) amounts transferred
in connection with a Transfer Election pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(i). Until the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date, the Company shall make withdrawals
and transfers from the Construction Account only in accordance with the Project Execution Plan, as directed by the Intel Member; provided, that the
proceeds of any Budgeted Capital Contributions shall be used solely for purposes of constructing the Arizona Fab and any other activities incidental to
such construction; provided, however, that the proceeds of any Unbudgeted Capital Contributions or Additional Brookfield Contribution shall be used
for any purpose set forth in the Unbudgeted Capital Call issued in connection therewith or such other matters as reasonably directed by the Intel
Member.
(b) Operating Account. At all times, the Company shall maintain an operating account (the “Operating Account”), separate from each of
the Construction Account, the Incentive Account and the Extraordinary Proceeds Account. The Operating Account shall be funded with: (x) revenue
received pursuant to the Wafer Supply Agreement (including the receipt of any Wafer Price Adjustment payable to the Company thereunder), (y)
Enumerated Payments, and (z) all other cash and cash equivalents received by the Company and its controlled Subsidiaries under any Main Project
Agreement (including Operator True-Up Payments but excluding damages (other than Enumerated Payments) and indemnification payments). Except as
specifically set forth herein and subject to Section 4.3, the Company, at the direction of the Intel Member, shall make transfers from the Operating
Account as follows:
 
11
(i) prior to the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date and subject to Section 4.1(f), all transfers from the Operating Account shall be
made in the following order of priority and for the following purposes:
1. first, to pay before the same become due and payable under the applicable Main Project Agreement:
(A) Reimbursable Expenses;
(B) Quarterly Services Fees;
(C) Pre-Completion Production Costs; and
(D) Quarterly True-Up Payments.
2. second, prior to the Longstop Date, in accordance with a Transfer Election; and
3. third, subject to Section 4.1(e), to pay a Distribution to the Members in accordance with Section 4.1(h); and
(ii) on and after the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date, all transfers from the Operating Account shall be made in the following
order of priority and for the following purposes from time to time:
1. first, to pay amounts due and payable by the Company;
2. second, and until the Intel Member receives Distributions pursuant to this clause in an amount that results in a 9.4% IRR to
the Intel Member in respect of all Unbudgeted Capital Contributions funded by the Intel Member pursuant to Section 2.6(e), to pay a Distribution
to the Intel Member (“Priority Distribution”);
3. third, and until the Intel Member receives Distributions pursuant to this clause in an amount equal to the aggregate payments
made to the Brookfield Member in respect of the Special Distribution Amount pursuant to Section 4.1(h), to pay a Distribution to the Intel
Member; and
4. fourth, subject to Section 4.1(e), to pay a Distribution to the Members in accordance with Section 4.1(h).
It is understood and agreed that all Enumerated Payments shall be deposited into the Operating Account.
 
12
(c) Transfer Elections; Offset Elections.
(i) Within ten (10) calendar days prior to each Quarterly Date that occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, the Board shall
(A) calculate Available Cash, if any, in the Operating Account that may be distributed in accordance with Section 4.1(h) on such Quarterly Date
(such amount, with respect to each Member as of such time, such Member’s “Transfer Balance”) and (B) deliver to each Member written notice of
the amount of Available Cash so determined in the foregoing clause (A) (a “Transfer Election Notice”). Upon receipt of any Transfer Election
Notice, each Member may elect, exercisable upon written notice to the Board at any time during the ten (10) day period immediately prior to the
Quarterly Date, to direct that the cash to which such Member would be entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(h) be transferred, effective as of the
Quarterly Date and in lieu of a Distribution of Available Cash to such Member, from the Operating Account to the Construction Account in lieu of
any Budgeted Capital Contributions that are contemplated by the Project Execution Plan to be required during the three (3) calendar months
following the relevant Quarterly Date and for which such Member is or would be responsible if called pursuant to a Capital Call (a “Transfer
Election”). Any notice delivered by a Member in connection with its Transfer Election shall specify whether the Additional Capital Contribution
is a Budgeted Capital Contribution or an Unbudgeted Capital Contribution and the amount thereof. In connection with any Transfer Election, for
purposes of Section 2.6, the applicable Member shall be deemed to have contributed cash equal to the amount transferred from the Operating
Account to the Construction Account in respect of such Transfer Election.
(ii) At the written election of the Intel Member delivered to the Board, the Excess Contribution Amount, if any, may be applied
(without duplication) towards any Capital Call for Budgeted Capital Contributions identified in such written election and shall reduce, on a dollar
for dollar basis, the amount the Intel Member is required to contribute in connection with any such Capital Call (any such reduction, an “Offset
Credit”).
(d) Incentive Account. At all times, the Company shall maintain a segregated account (the “Incentive Account”), separate from each of the
Construction Account, the Operating Account and the Extraordinary Proceeds Account. The Incentive Account shall be funded with any Economic
Incentives received by the Company in cash. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any funds in the Incentive Account
constitute Available Cash or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be otherwise available to satisfy Company obligations unless otherwise agreed
to by the Intel Member. Upon written notice of election at any time by the Intel Member, the Company shall transfer or distribute all or any portion of
such amounts held in the Incentive Account (as directed by, and for the benefit of, the Intel Member) to (i) the Construction Account in lieu of the Intel
Member making a Capital Contribution pursuant to a Capital Call (and, in such case, all such amounts so transferred shall be deemed contributed in
satisfaction of the applicable Capital Call by the Intel Member or otherwise credited to the Intel Member against future Capital Calls), (ii) to the
Extraordinary Proceeds Account for such purposes as determined by the Intel Member, or (iii) the Intel Member in a special distribution, which for
clarity shall not be pro rata to all Members, solely to the extent not prohibited by the terms of such Economic Incentives.
 
13
(e) Investor Liability. In the event of any Investor Liability, the Company shall promptly notify the Brookfield Member in writing of the
amount of such Investor Liability, including a reasonably detailed basis for asserting a liability is an Investor Liability and a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount thereof (an “Investor Liability Notice”). If the Brookfield Member fails to dispute any such Investor Liability within ten
(10) Business Days of receiving the Investor Liability Notice, then the determination of the Investor Liability shall be final and binding. If the
Brookfield Member disputes any such Investor Liability, it shall deliver a written notice of such dispute to the Company (each, a “Dispute Notice”), with
the Intel Member in copy, within ten (10) Business Days of the Brookfield Member’s receipt of the Investor Liability Notice, and the Company and the
Brookfield Member shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such dispute, including mutual agreement on the amount of such Investor Liability,
within ten (10) Business Days of the Company’s receipt of the Dispute Notice. If (i) the Brookfield Member does not deliver a Dispute Notice during the
ten (10) Business Day period following the Brookfield Member’s receipt of the Investor Liability Notice or (ii) the Brookfield Member delivers as
Dispute Notice during the ten (10) Business Day period following the Brookfield Member’s receipt of the Investor Liability Notice and such dispute is
not resolved and settled by the tenth (10th) Business Day following the Company’s receipt of the Dispute Notice (the occurrence of the event described
in clause (i) or (ii), the “Investor Liability Trigger”), the Brookfield Member shall promptly pay to the Company (which in no event shall be more than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the occurrence of the Investor Liability Trigger) an amount equal to the Investor Liability. If the Brookfield Member
fails to pay the Investor Liability when due, then the amount of Available Cash (or such lesser amount equal to the Investor Liability if the Investor
Liability is for a lesser amount) that would have otherwise been allocated and distributed to the Brookfield Member in accordance with Section 4.1(h)
on each subsequent Quarterly Date (after giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(i)) shall instead be retained by the Company in
satisfaction of such Investor Liability until such Investor Liability is paid in full; provided, that if the Investor Liability exceeds the amount of Available
Cash to be retained in accordance with this Section 4.1(e), then the Brookfield Member shall continue to be liable to the Company for the unpaid portion
of the Investor Liability. Any amounts actually or deemed to be contributed by the Brookfield Member pursuant to this Section 4.1(e) shall be “Investor
Liability Contributions.” For the avoidance of doubt, if the Brookfield Member and the Company do not agree on the existence or amount of an Investor
Liability, the amount of the Investor Liability set forth in the Investor Liability Notice shall not be final and binding, and the Brookfield Member may
seek remedies in accordance with Section 19.5, including relief from its requirement to fund any portion of liability set forth in the Investor Liability
Notice that does not constitute an Investor Liability.
(f) Extraordinary Proceeds Account. At all times prior to the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date, the Company shall maintain a segregated
account (the “Extraordinary Proceeds Account”), separate from each of the Construction Account, the Operating Account and the Incentive Account.
The Extraordinary Proceeds Account shall be funded with any Extraordinary Proceeds. The Company shall use amounts held in the Extraordinary
Proceeds Account to fund costs of the Company (including Company Net Liabilities), other than those costs and expenditures set forth in the Project
Execution Plan; provided, that damages (other than Enumerated Payments) and indemnification payments under the Main Project Agreements received
by the Company shall be first used to satisfy the Company Net Liabilities with respect to which they were paid, if applicable. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, in no event shall any funds in the Extraordinary Proceeds Account constitute Available Cash.
 
14
(g) Transfer of Funds Among Company Accounts. The Intel Member shall be permitted to transfer funds from one Company Account to
another Company Account to the extent such funds were originally deposited into such Company Account as a result of clear and manifest error as
determined in good faith by the Board; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time following the date on which all payments required
under the Project Execution Plan have been made, the Intel Member shall be permitted to transfer funds from the Construction Account to the Operating
Account.
(h) Quarterly Distributions. Subject to Section 4.1(f), on each Quarterly Date, the Company shall make a Distribution to the Members
equal in the aggregate to all Available Cash, allocated among the Members based on the Pro Rata Share of each Member; provided, that any transfer
made in connection with a Transfer Election shall be deemed a Distribution of Available Cash to the instructing Member and any amount of Available
Cash actually distributed to such Member on the Quarterly Date shall be reduced (without duplication of any prior reductions to Available Cash pursuant
to this Section 4.1(h)) dollar for dollar with respect to any such Transfer Election; provided, further, that from and after April 1, 2027, the amount of
Available Cash otherwise distributable to the Intel Member pursuant to this Section 4.1(h) shall instead be distributed to the Brookfield Member until
such amount distributed to the Brookfield Member pursuant to this proviso equals, in the aggregate, the Special Distribution Amount.
(i) Parent Guaranty. Any amounts paid to the Company by Intel pursuant to the Intel Parent Guaranty for Guaranteed Obligations (as
defined in the Intel Parent Guaranty) shall be deposited into the same account into which such proceeds would have been deposited if the Intel Member
had made the applicable payment or contribution required by the underlying Guaranteed Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, all such amounts shall
be paid into the Construction Account or the Extraordinary Proceeds Account, as applicable.
Section 4.2 No Violation. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make a Distribution
to any Member on account of such Member’s Units if such Distribution would violate Section 18-607 of the Act or any other applicable Law.
Section 4.3 Withholding; Tax Indemnity. All amounts withheld pursuant to any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax Law with respect to any
payment, distribution or allocation to a Member, or which the Company is otherwise obligated to pay to any Governmental Entity because of the status
of (or that is otherwise attributable to) a Member of the Company (including any interest, penalties and expenses associated with such payments), shall
be treated as amounts distributed to such Member for all purposes of this Agreement. The Partnership Representative shall reasonably determine in good
faith the portion of any tax-related liability (including taxes, interest, penalties, and additions thereto) that is attributable to a Member and shall consult
in good faith with the Members regarding such determination. The Partnership Representative is authorized to withhold from any payments or
distributions to Members, or with respect to allocations to Members, and in each case to pay over to the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S.
government any amounts required to be so withheld. The Partnership Representative shall allocate any such amounts to the Members in respect of
whose payment, distribution or allocation the tax was withheld and shall treat such amounts as actually distributed to such Members. Each Member
further agrees to indemnify the Company in full for any amounts paid
 
15
pursuant to this Section 4.3 or other amounts paid to any Governmental Entity that is specifically attributable to a Member or a Member’s status as such
(or, if applicable, its direct or indirect owner) (including any U.S. federal withholding taxes, state personal property taxes, state unincorporated business
taxes or any other taxes and any interest, penalties and expenses associated with such payments), to the extent such amounts are not already withheld
from any payment or distribution to such Member, and each Member shall promptly upon notification of an obligation to indemnify the Company
pursuant to this Section 4.3 make a cash payment to the Company (or the Board may offset Distributions to which a Member is otherwise entitled under
this Agreement) equal to the full amount to be indemnified (and the amount paid shall not be treated as a Capital Contribution) with interest to accrue on
any portion of such cash payment not paid in full when requested, calculated at a rate equal to the Prime Plus Rate per annum, compounded as of the last
day of each year (but not in excess of the highest rate per annum permitted by Law). An indemnifying Member’s obligation to make contributions to
indemnify the Company under this Section 4.3 shall survive the transfer, forfeiture or other disposition of the indemnifying Member’s Units and the
termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company, and for purposes of this Section 4.3, the Company shall be treated as continuing in
existence. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any determinations by the Partnership Representative under this
Section 4.3 could reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate and adverse impact on the Brookfield Member, the Partnership Representative shall
not make such determination without the prior written consent of the Brookfield Member (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).
Section 4.4 Property Distributions. If any assets of the Company shall be distributed in kind pursuant to this Article 4, such assets shall be
distributed to the Members based on the Pro Rata Share of each Member. The amount by which the Fair Value of any property to be distributed in kind
to the Members exceeds or is less than the then prevailing Asset Value of such property shall, to the extent not otherwise recognized by the Company, be
taken into account in determining Net Profit and Net Loss and determining the Capital Accounts of the Members as if such property had been sold at its
Fair Value immediately prior to such Distribution.
Section 4.5 Net Profit or Net Loss.
(a) The “Net Profit” or “Net Loss” of the Company for each Fiscal Year or relevant part thereof shall mean an amount equal to the
Company’s taxable income or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes for such period determined in accordance with Section 703(a) of the Code
(including all items of income, gain, loss or deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to Section 703(a)(1) of the Code) with the following
adjustments:
(i) Any income of the Company that is exempt from U.S. federal income tax and not otherwise taken into account in computing Net
Profit or Net Loss pursuant to this Section 4.5(a) shall be added to such taxable income or loss.
(ii) Any expenses or expenditures of the Company which may neither be deducted nor capitalized for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (or are so treated for tax purposes) and not otherwise taken into account in computing Net Profit or Net Loss pursuant to this
Section 4.5(a) shall be subtracted from such taxable income or loss.
 
16
(iii) Gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property of the Company with an Asset Value different than the adjusted basis of
such property for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be computed with respect to the Asset Value of such property, and any tax gain or loss
not included in Net Profit or Net Loss shall be taken into account and allocated for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Members pursuant
to Section 4.7.
(iv) Depreciation, amortization or cost recovery deductions with respect to any property with an Asset Value that differs from its
adjusted basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be computed in accordance with Asset Value, and any depreciation allowable for U.S.
federal income tax purposes shall be allocated in accordance with Section 4.7.
(v) If the Company makes an election under Section 754 of the Code to provide a special basis adjustment upon the transfer of a Unit
or the distribution of property by the Company, Capital Accounts will be adjusted to the limited extent required by the Treasury Regulations under
Section 704 of the Code following such transfer or distribution.
(vi) Any items that are required to be specially allocated pursuant to Section 4.6 shall not be taken into account in determining Net
Profit or Net Loss.
(b) After the application of Section 4.6, the Net Profit and Net Loss of the Company for any relevant fiscal period or, to the extent
determined by the Partnership Representative (after consultation with the Brookfield Member and considering any reasonable comment of the
Brookfield Member in good faith) to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Section 4.5(b) and Section 4.6(b), gross items of income, gain,
deduction, and loss constituting such Net Profit and Net Loss, shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Members so as to cause, to the extent
possible, the capital accounts of the Members as of the end of such fiscal period, as increased by the Members’ shares of “minimum gain” and “partner
minimum gain” (as such terms are used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2) not otherwise required to be taken into account in such period, to be
equal to the aggregate Distributions that Members would be entitled to receive (assuming all outstanding Units were vested) if all of the assets of the
Company were sold for their Asset Values (assuming for this purpose only that the Asset Value of an asset that secures a non-recourse liability for
purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1001-2 is no less than the amount of such liability that is allocated to such asset in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(d)(2)), all liabilities of the Company were repaid from the proceeds of sale and the net remaining proceeds were distributed
as of the end of such accounting period in accordance with Section 4.1(b)(ii)(2) through (4) and Section 4.1(d), but, for purposes of (i) Section 4.1(b)(ii)
(2) and (3), prior to the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date, disregarding the Intel Member’s entitlement to any amount in excess of the amount of any
Unbudgeted Capital Contributions as of such time and (ii) Section 4.1(b)(ii)(4), prior to April 1, 2027, disregarding the Brookfield Member’s
entitlement to the Special Distribution Amount.
(c) The allocations made pursuant to this Section 4.5 and Section 4.6 are intended to comply with (i) the provisions of Section 704(b) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and, in particular, to reflect the Members’ economic interests in the Company as set forth in
Section 4.1 and (ii) the intention that all of the benefits and burdens in respect of Economic Incentives shall be allocated to the Intel Member, and the
Board is hereby authorized to reasonably interpret this Section 4.5 and Section 4.6 to the extent necessary to implement such intention in good faith.
 
17
Section 4.6 Special Allocations.
(a) Regulatory Allocations. Provisions governing the allocation of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (and items thereof) are
included in this Agreement as may be necessary to provide that the Company’s allocation provisions contain a so-called “Qualified Income Offset” and
comply with all provisions relating to the allocation of so-called “Nonrecourse Deductions” and “Member Nonrecourse Deductions” and the chargeback
thereof as set forth in the Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) of the Code (“Regulatory Allocations”); provided, however, that the Members
intend that all Regulatory Allocations that may be required shall be offset by other Regulatory Allocations or special allocations of tax items so that each
Member’s share of the Net Profit, Net Loss and capital of the Company will be the same as it would have been had the events requiring the Regulatory
Allocations not occurred.
(b) Allocations Relating to Economic Incentives. Any items of gross income or loss (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any items with
respect to tax-exempt income, any basis reduction, or any loss or tax liability that may arise as a result of recapture or disallowance) arising from or with
respect to any Economic Incentives received in cash are to be allocated to the Intel Member, and any items with respect to or resulting from any tax
credits arising by way of or with respect to any Economic Incentives (including any recapture or loss of such tax credits or basis reduction attributable to
such tax credits) shall be allocated to the Intel Member.
Section 4.7 Tax Allocations.
(a) Contributed Assets. In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property
contributed to the Company with an adjusted basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes different from the initial Asset Value at which such property
was accepted by the Company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take into account such difference in the manner
required by Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
(b) Revalued Assets. If the Asset Values of any assets of the Company are adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2, subsequent allocations of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such assets shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take into account
such adjustment in the same manner as under Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
consistent with the intent of the Members, any revaluation gain with respect to any property the basis of which has been reduced as result of or in
connection with obtaining any Economic Incentives shall be attributed solely to the Intel Member.
 
18
(c) Elections and Limitations. The allocations required by this Section 4.7 are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local income
taxes and shall not affect the allocation of Net Profits or Net Losses as between Members or any Member’s Capital Account. All tax allocations required
by this Section 4.7 shall be made using the “traditional method” permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b), unless the Board and the
Members jointly and reasonably determine that another method permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3 is more appropriate. For the
avoidance of doubt, basis will be allocated between Code Section 704(c) layers (if any) in a way that reduces any “ceiling rule” limitations (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b)(1)), to the extent applicable, to the Brookfield Member (or its regarded owner for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) to the greatest extent possible with respect to its Units.
(d) Allocations. Except as set forth in this Agreement or otherwise required by Law, all items of income, deduction, loss and credit shall be
allocated for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes in the same manner such items are allocated for purposes of maintaining Capital
Accounts.
Section 4.8 Changes in Members’ Units. If during any year there is a change in any Member’s Unit, the Partnership Representative shall allocate
the Net Profit or Net Loss to the Members so as to take into account the varying Units of the Members in the Company using an “interim closing of the
books” method in a manner that complies with the provisions of Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
ARTICLE 5
STATUS, RIGHTS AND POWERS OF MEMBERS
Section 5.1 Limited Liability. Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts, expenses, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether
arising in contract, tort or otherwise, will be solely the debts, expenses, obligations and liabilities of the Company, and no Member will be obligated
personally for any such debt, expense, obligation or liability of the Company solely by reason of being a Member. All Persons dealing with the
Company will have recourse solely to the assets of the Company for the payment of the debts, expenses, obligations or liabilities of the Company. In no
event will any Member be required to make up any deficit balance in such Member’s Capital Account upon the liquidation of such Member’s Units or
otherwise.
Section 5.2 Return of Distributions of Capital. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as otherwise expressly required by Law, a
Member, in such capacity, shall have no liability for obligations or liabilities of the Company in excess of (a) the amount of Capital Contributions made
or required to be made by such Member, (b) such Member’s share of any assets and undistributed profits of the Company and (c) to the extent required
by Law or this Agreement, the amount of any Distributions wrongfully distributed to such Member. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as
otherwise required by Law, upon an insolvency of the Company, no Member shall be obligated by this Agreement to return any Distribution to the
Company or pay the amount of any Distribution for the account of the Company or to any creditor of the Company; provided, however, that if any court
of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding this Agreement, any Member is obligated to return or pay any part of any Distribution, such
obligation shall bind such Member alone and not any other Member or any Board Member; provided, further, that if any Member is required to return
all or any portion of any Distribution under circumstances that are not unique to such Member but that would have been applicable to all Members if
such Members had been named in the lawsuit against the Member in
 
19
question (such as where a Distribution was made to all Members and rendered the Company insolvent, but only one Member was sued for the return of
such Distribution), the Member that was required to return or repay the Distribution (or any portion thereof) shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
other Members that were not required to return the Distributions made to them based on each such Member’s Pro Rata Share of the Distribution in
question. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence are solely for the benefit of the Members and shall not be construed as benefiting any
Third Party. The amount of any Distribution returned to the Company by a Member or paid by a Member for the account of the Company or to a creditor
of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be added to the account or accounts from which it was subtracted when it was distributed to such
Member.
Section 5.3 No Management or Control. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Member shall take part in or interfere in any manner
with the management of the business and affairs of the Company notwithstanding Section 18-402 of the Act.
Section 5.4 Voting. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including Articles 6 and 7 and Schedule 6.1 hereof) or as required
by applicable Law that cannot be waived, no matter or action will require the vote or approval of the Members. In the event any matter or action is
required by applicable Law to be submitted to a vote (or for the approval) of the Members and such Law cannot be waived, (a) the Units will vote
together as a single class, (b) each Member shall be entitled to one vote per Unit held by such Member, and (c) action by written consent in lieu of a
meeting is expressly permitted if such written consent is signed by Members having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Units entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided that, unless consented to in
writing by the Brookfield Member, any such written consent must be distributed to all Members at least forty-eight (48) hours before execution and an
executed version of any such written consent shall be circulated to all Members within twenty-four (24) hours of execution.
ARTICLE 6
DESIGNATION, RIGHTS, AUTHORITIES, POWERS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD
Section 6.1 Board.
(a) The business of the Company will be managed by the Board, and the Persons constituting the Board will be the “managers” of the
Company for all purposes under the Act; provided that, except as otherwise provided herein, and notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 18-402 of
the Act, no single member of the Board may bind the Company, and the Board will have the power to act only collectively in accordance with the
provisions and in the manner specified herein and in Schedule 6.1. The Board will initially be the individuals set forth in Schedule 6.1. Thereafter, the
individuals constituting the Board will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 6.1. Schedule 6.1 sets forth the procedures for the
conduct of the affairs of the Board and decisions of the Board will be set forth in a resolution adopted in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Schedule 6.1. Such decisions will be decisions of the Company’s “manager” for all purposes of the Act and will be carried out by officers or agents of
the Company designated by the Board in the resolution in question or in one or more standing resolutions or with the power and authority to do so under
Article 7.
 
20
(b) A decision of the Board may be amended, modified or repealed in the same manner in which it was adopted or in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Schedule 6.1 as then in effect; provided, however, that no such amendment, modification or repeal will affect any Person who has
been furnished a copy of the original resolution, certified by a duly authorized officer of the Company, until such Person has been notified in writing of
such amendment, modification or repeal; provided, further that no such amendment, modification or repeal will invalidate actions previously authorized
by such original resolution with respect to any Person if such original resolution has been relied upon in good faith by such Person.
Section 6.2 Authority of the Board. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Board will have the exclusive power and
authority to manage the business and affairs of the Company and to make all decisions with respect thereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, the Board or Persons designated by the Board, including officers and agents of the Company appointed by the Board, will be the only
Persons authorized to execute documents which will be binding on the Company. To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, but subject to any
specific provisions hereof granting rights to Members, the Board will have the power to perform any acts, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Company or this Agreement, which would otherwise be possessed by the Members under Delaware law, and the Members will have no power
whatsoever with respect to the management of the business and affairs of the Company. As permitted by Sections 18-209(b), 18-213(b), 18-216(b),
18-301(b)(1), 18-302(a), 18-302(b), 18-304, 18-704(a), 18-801(a) and 18-803(a) of the Act, the power and authority granted to the Board hereunder will
include all those necessary, advisable or incidental for the accomplishment of the purposes of the Company set forth in Section 1.5 and the exercise of
the powers of the Company set forth in Section 1.6. Except as otherwise stated herein, any decision, action, approval, authorization, election or
determination made by the Board in furtherance of the terms herein may be made by the Board in its sole discretion.
Section 6.3 Reliance by Third Parties. Any Person dealing with the Company or the Members may rely upon a certificate signed by any Intel
Manager as to: (a) the identity of the Members, (b) the existence or non-existence of any fact or facts which constitute a condition precedent to acts by
Members or are in any other manner germane to the affairs of the Company, (c) the Persons which are authorized to execute and deliver any instrument
or document of or on behalf of the Company, (d) the authorization of any action by or on behalf of the Company by the Board or any officer or agent
acting on behalf of the Company or (e) any act or failure to act by the Company or as to any other matter whatsoever involving the Company or the
Members.
Section 6.4 Certain Approval Rights. The Company shall not take, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (and its and their respective agents and
Representatives, including, solely with respect to its role as the “partnership representative” within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code, the
Partnership Representative) not to take, any of the actions set forth on Schedule 6.4 without the affirmative approval (whether acting at a meeting or by
written consent) of the majority of Board Members, which majority shall include at least one Brookfield Manager; provided, that the items marked with
** on Schedule 6.4 shall be deemed removed therefrom effective from and after the O&M Agreement Initial Term Date. Any action taken that is not in
compliance with this Section 6.4 and Schedule 6.4 shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect.
 
21
Section 6.5 Certain Requirements of the Board; Operation of the Company.
(a) The Intel Member shall cause the Intel Managers to vote in favor of causing the Company to enforce the Transaction Documents (other
than this Agreement). The Company shall be operated in material compliance with all applicable Laws, and each Member shall act in its capacity as
such in accordance with all applicable Laws in all material respects.
(b) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives (in each case, solely to the extent acting at the direction or in
the name of the Company) not to, (i) maintain, form, sponsor, donate, provide financial support, or in any way contribute or provide money or anything
of value to, any Person engaged in or otherwise involved in political activities, including any political action committee (including related charitable
organizations) or political candidate, any state, district, local or national party or party committee or (ii) donate or otherwise provide financial support to
any political or charitable organization.
ARTICLE 7
DESIGNATION, RIGHTS, AUTHORITIES, POWERS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES OF OFFICERS AND AGENTS
Section 7.1 Officers, Agents. The Intel Managers, acting with majority approval, shall appoint officers and/or agents of the Company to such
positions and with such titles, if any, as such Intel Managers deem appropriate and to delegate to such officers or agents such of the powers as are
granted to the Board hereunder, including (as applicable) the power to run the day-to-day business of the Company, to execute documents on behalf of
the Company and to cause the Company to perform and/or make elections under the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement), in each case,
as the Intel Managers may reasonably determine; provided, however, that no such delegation by the Intel Managers will cause the Persons constituting
the Board to cease to be the “managers” of the Company within the meaning of the Act; provided, further, that no such delegation by the Intel Managers
shall be permitted if it will result in the Company taking any of the actions set forth in Section 6.4 or Schedule 6.4 without the written consent of all
Persons having approval rights pursuant thereto and in breach of Section 6.4 or Schedule 6.4, as the case may be. Subject to Section 6.4 and
Schedule 6.4, unless the authority of the officer in question is limited in the document appointing such officer or is otherwise specified by the Intel
Managers, any officer so appointed shall have the same authority to act for the Company as a corresponding officer of a Delaware corporation would
have to act for a Delaware corporation in the absence of a specific delegation of authority, and if appointed to serve any role required by the NISPOM in
connection with a facility clearance, shall have the authority and responsibility to act as required by any applicable NISPOM Requirements; provided,
that unless such power is specifically delegated to the officer in question either for a specific transaction or generally in a separate writing, no such
officer shall have the power to lease or acquire real property, to borrow money, to issue notes, debentures, securities, equity or other interests of or in the
Company, to make investments in (other than the investment of surplus cash in the ordinary course of business) or to acquire securities of any Person, to
give guarantees or indemnities, to merge, liquidate or dissolve the Company or to sell or lease all or any substantial portion of the assets of the
Company.
 
22
Section 7.2 Tenure. Each officer of the Company shall hold office until his or her respective successor is chosen and qualified unless a shorter
period shall have been specified by the terms of his or her election or appointment, or in each case until he or she sooner dies, resigns, is removed or
becomes disqualified. Each agent of the Company shall retain his or her authority at the pleasure of the Intel Managers, or the officer by whom he or she
was appointed or by the officer who then holds agent appointive power.
Section 7.3 Vacancies. If the office of any officer of the Company becomes vacant, the Intel Managers, acting with majority approval, may choose
a successor. Each such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term, and until his or her successor is chosen and qualified or in each case until he or
she sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.
Section 7.4 Resignation and Removal. The Intel Managers, acting with majority approval, may at any time remove any officer and/or agent of the
Company with or without cause. Any officer may resign at any time by delivering his or her resignation in writing to the Board. Such resignation shall
be effective upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some other time, and without in either case the necessity of its being accepted unless the
resignation shall so state.
ARTICLE 8
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS
Section 8.1 Books and Records. The Company shall maintain at its principal office, or such other office as the Board shall determine, such books
and records with respect to the Company’s business as the Board deems appropriate.
Section 8.2 Reports. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide concurrently to each Member (a) as soon as practicable
upon reasonable written request of any Member (at its sole cost), to the extent available, estimates of taxable income and other relevant information that
such Member requires for its tax filings and tax calculations, (b) a preliminary Schedule K-1 within ninety (90) calendar days after the end of Fiscal
Year (or as soon as practicable thereafter), providing the Company’s reasonable best estimate of such Member’s share of income, gains, loss, deductions
and credits of the Company for the prior year, and (c) a final Schedule K-1 by no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the end of each
Fiscal Year. Each Member shall have the right, for a purpose reasonably related to such Member’s interest as a Member of the Company, upon written
demand (accompanied by a statement of purpose with respect to such demand), to obtain a copy of the Company’s U.S. federal, state and local income
tax returns for each Fiscal Year. In any event, if the Company or Partnership Representative provides information regarding the Intel Member’s income,
gains, loss or deduction to the Intel Member at the Intel Member’s request, the Company or Partnership Representative shall promptly provide similar
information to the Brookfield Member regarding the Brookfield Member’s income, gains, loss or deduction.
 
23
Section 8.3 Transaction Documents Reports and Notices. The Company will reasonably promptly, and in no event later than five (5) Business
Days after receipt thereof, deliver to the Members (a) each material notice received by the Company under the Main Project Agreements and (b) the
reports received by the Company, the Intel Member or its applicable Affiliate under Section 7.3 of the EPC Contract, Sections 4.6.1.1, 5.1 and 5.3.5 of

Section 8.4 Inspection.
(a) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.6 or Section 8.7, the Company and each of the Members acknowledge that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 18-305 of the Act but subject to Section 8.6 hereof, no Member nor any of the Members’ respective Representatives
shall have access to visit or inspect the Company’s properties; examine its books of account and records; or discuss the Company’s affairs, finances, and
accounts with Representatives of the Company (excluding Board Members appointed by such Member), whether or not during normal business hours of
the Company; provided, however, that the Intel Member may grant any such access in its sole discretion; provided, further, that in each case:
(i) the Company shall not be obligated to provide access to any Restricted Access Areas or any information (A) to the extent
prohibited by applicable Law or regulation or pursuant to any agreement with or obligation to a Governmental Entity (including any applicable
FOCI and CFIUS mitigation agreements), and (B) that the Intel Member reasonably considers in good faith to be a trade secret or similarly
competitively sensitive confidential information to Intel and its Affiliates or the disclosure of which, on the advice of counsel, would adversely
affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel (provided, further, that if there is a limit to a Member’s or its
representatives’ right to access such information, then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek to develop an alternative to
providing such access to information to such Persons in a manner reasonably acceptable to such Persons);
(ii) any such permitted inspection by or on behalf of any Member other than the Intel Member shall be conducted by a third-party
firm mutually agreeable to the Members and subject to restrictions no more burdensome than those Intel would require for access to other similar
facilities owned or operated by Intel or its Subsidiaries; and
(iii) an independent engineer approved by the Intel Member (in its reasonable discretion) will be provided access to the Company’s
properties determined by Intel in Intel’s reasonable discretion, but will be subject to Intel’s policies and procedures, it being understood that such
independent engineer shall not have access to Restricted Access Areas or any other proprietary equipment, production areas or procedures as
determined by the Intel Member in its reasonable discretion, for the purpose of (A) providing a closing date report and (B) confirming the content
of the Construction Report (as defined and in the form set forth in the EPC Contract) that will be prepared by an Affiliate of the Intel Member
under the EPC Contract.
 
24
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, auditors and accountants of the Company shall not be obligated to make
any work papers available to a Member unless and until such Member has signed a customary agreement relating to such access in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such auditors or accountants and the provision of such information is not prohibited by applicable Law or regulation or
pursuant to any agreement (including any applicable FOCI or CFIUS mitigation agreement) with or obligation to a Governmental Entity.
Section 8.5 Non-Disclosure.
(a) Each Member agrees that, except as otherwise consented to by the Board, all commercially sensitive, non-public information,
confidential information or proprietary information, in each case relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries furnished to such Member prior to, on or
after the date hereof (collectively, “Confidential Information”) will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed by such Member in any manner, in
whole or in part, except that, with respect to any Confidential Information provided to such Member on or after the Contribution Agreement Execution
Date, (i) each Member (and its Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, partners, employees, agents and members) shall be
permitted to disclose such Confidential Information (A) to those of such Member’s Affiliates, and its and their respective agents, Representatives and
employees who (x) need to be familiar with such Confidential Information in connection with such Member’s investment in the Company or its
obligations under the Transaction Documents and (y) are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as the obligations set forth herein
(“Acceptable Confidentiality Provisions”), (B) to such Member’s existing or prospective direct (or, in the case of fund-level investors, indirect) limited
partners and equity holders so long as they are subject to confidentiality restrictions not less onerous than those set forth herein, (C) to the extent
required to be disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Entity, or by any Law, rule or regulation, or by subpoena,
summons or any other administrative or legal process, or by applicable regulatory standards (after (x) taking commercially reasonable steps to redact or
otherwise maintain confidential treatment with respect to such information, and (y) notice of such requirement has been given to the Company, in each
case, to the extent legally permissible, and the Company has had a reasonable opportunity to oppose such disclosure), (D) to the extent necessary for the
enforcement of any right of such Member arising under this Agreement, (E) to the extent required to be disclosed on any tax return or in connection with
any audit or other proceeding relating to taxes, (F) to potential permitted transferees in connection with the exercise of such Member’s rights as set forth
in Section 10.2(b), so long as they are subject to a confidentiality agreement containing Acceptable Confidentiality Provisions, and (G) to any potential
equity (other than fund-level limited partners, which are the subject of subclause (B) above) or debt financing sources, or otherwise to any Person in
connection with obtaining any potential financing (and any refinancing thereof) incurred by such Member or a proposed Transferee (eligible for such
Transfer under the terms hereof) of any Transferring Member in connection with its financing or investment in the Company, as applicable (including
inclusion of such information in any bank information memoranda, offering memoranda or rating agency presentations), in each case described in this
clause (G), so long as (x) the recipient of such Confidential Information is subject to a confidentiality agreement containing Acceptable Confidentiality
Provisions (which may include “click through” or other affirmative action by such recipient to access such Confidential Information contained in bank
information memoranda,
 
25
offering memoranda, rating agency presentations or other marketing materials hosted on an electronic system or platform and acknowledge its
confidential obligations in respect thereof) and (y) such recipient is not an Intel Competitor or an Affiliate thereof, and (ii) Affiliates of each of the Intel
Member and the Brookfield Member shall be permitted to disclose such Confidential Information as part of its or its Affiliates’ normal internal reporting
or review procedure (subject to such Members’ internal confidentiality policies and procedures). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Member and its
Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind (other than to bind the recipient thereof to a written nondisclosure
agreement with Acceptable Confidentiality Provisions and subject to the following sentence), the tax treatment, tax strategies and tax structure of the
Company and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Member and its Representatives relating to
such tax treatment, tax strategies and tax structure. Each Member agrees that it will be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of this
Section 8.5(a) by any of its Representatives. The Members acknowledge and agree the Intel Member shall be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions
of this Section 8.5(a) and each of the confidentiality agreements containing Acceptable Confidentiality Provisions to which it is not a party, and the Intel
Member shall be entitled to enforce such provisions on behalf of the Company against the Brookfield Member and such third party in the event of its
actual or threatened breach or violation.
(b) For purposes of this Section 8.5, “Confidential Information” shall not include any information: (i) that is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by any Person not otherwise permitted pursuant to this Section 8.5, which for clarity shall
include general statements in respect of the transactions to the extent permitted by the Contribution Agreement, (ii) of which such Person (or its
Affiliates) learns from sources other than the Company or its Subsidiaries or their predecessors; provided, that such source is not known (after
reasonable inquiry undertaken in good faith) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such information, (iii) that is developed independently by any Person without
the use of any Confidential Information (other than in such Person’s capacity as an officer, manager, employee or consultant of the Company or its
Subsidiaries), (iv) which is disclosed in a prospectus or other documents available for dissemination to the public otherwise in compliance with the
requirements of this Agreement or (v) which is disclosed with the written approval of the Board with respect to such Confidential Information related to
the Company or its Affiliates, including this Agreement, the terms hereof and all agreements and documents related hereto.
Section 8.6 Information Rights. The Company shall furnish the following to each Member concurrently, subject to any Law, regulations, or
express obligation to any Governmental Entity:
(a) No later than ninety (90) calendar days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Company, the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such Fiscal Year and the consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in members’ equity
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such Fiscal Year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the immediately preceding Fiscal
Year, and in each case which shall not be required to include footnotes, accompanied by an audit report of independent certified public accountants of
recognized national standing thereon, which accountants shall be selected by the Board;
 
26
(b) No later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each Fiscal Quarter of the Company for the first three Fiscal Quarters of a
Fiscal Year, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such Fiscal Quarter and the consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and changes in members’ equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Fiscal Year then ended, setting forth in
the case of the consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in members’ equity in comparative form the figures for the corresponding
period of the previous Fiscal Year, and, in the case of such balance sheet in comparative form the figures for the last day of the previous Fiscal Year, and
in each case which shall not be required to include footnotes and shall not be required to be reviewed by the accountants; and
(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in this Section 8.6, the Company shall timely prepare and deliver to any Member upon such
Member’s reasonable request and at such Member’s sole cost and expense, such additional financial information as shall be required in order for each
Member and its Affiliates to comply with any applicable reporting requirements under (i) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) any National
Securities Exchange or automated quotation system, or (iii) any other rules or regulations promulgated by a Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over
such Member or its Affiliates; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligations shall not require the Company to disclose Intel IP to
any such Member; provided, further, that in no event shall the Intel Member or its Affiliates be required to provide any such information that is not
readily available in scope or form.
Each Member shall be permitted to deliver to its financing sources any financial information, budget or report delivered to it by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3 or this Section 8.6 (including providing such information in marketing and offering materials in connection with the arrangement,
syndication, marketing and consummation of any debt financing (and any refinancing thereof)). For clarity, any disclosure of such information shall be
used and disclosed by such Member solely for such purposes and shall be subject to confidentiality standards substantially similar to those set forth in
Section 8.5(a)(i)(G).
Section 8.7 Financing Support.
(a) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (solely to the extent such Representatives have significant, direct involvement in the operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide customary support reasonably requested by any Member, at such Member’s sole
expense, in connection with the arrangement, syndication, marketing and consummation of any debt financing (and any refinancing thereof) incurred by
such Member or a proposed Transferee (eligible for such Transfer under the terms hereof) of any Transferring Member in connection with its investment
into the Company, including to (x) provide customary information about the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required to be included in
customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda, offering memoranda and similar
customary marketing documents reasonably required in connection with such debt financing or refinancing (it being understood that such Member or
proposed Transferee shall, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to such materials being shared with any external parties, provide the foregoing
marketing documents to the Intel Member and the Company for their information only
 
27
(and not approval) to the extent they contain material changes from such materials previously delivered, which marketing documents shall provide that
any such debt financing or refinancing is non-recourse to the Company, Intel and Intel’s Affiliates; provided, that Brookfield may describe the terms of
the Main Project Agreements (but shall not provide a copy of any such Main Project Agreements to any Person unless subject to confidentiality
undertakings) in such marketing documents); and (y) cooperate reasonably with the due diligence requirements of the lenders or purchasers of such debt
financing or refinancing, to the extent customary and reasonable, it being understood that the financing support and cooperation under this Section 8.7(a)
shall include providing information and financial data of the Company and its Subsidiaries (I) that is customarily included in a bank information
memorandum or (II) in the case of an offering memorandum with respect to a Rule 144A/Regulation S marketed private placement of debt securities
through one or more investment banks acting as “initial purchasers,” that would be necessary for the Company’s independent accountants to provide to
such initial purchasers customary “comfort” letters (including customary “negative assurance” comfort and, if available, change period comfort) for
such a private placement with respect to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in such offering memorandum, and, if
requested, “management discussion and analysis” for the most recently completed Fiscal Year and year-to-date through the end of the most recently
completed Fiscal Quarter, in each case for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 8.6, or information of the type required
for the preparation of such “management discussion and analysis,” in each case subject to exceptions customary for such financings; provided that (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will not be obligated to provide information reasonably determined by the Intel
Member to be sensitive to Intel or to the Company, (ii) any information provided shall be subject to agreed confidentiality undertakings by the recipients
thereof, (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will not be required to participate in any meeting, presentation, road
show, due diligence session or session with any rating agency in connection with any such debt financing (or refinancing), (iv) the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will not be required to prepare or provide any financial statements beyond what is required pursuant to
Section 8.6(a) and Section 8.6(b), (v) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will not be required to prepare or provide
any information not readily available or accessible to the Company or that cannot reasonably be prepared by the Company without undue effort or
expense, (vi) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will not be obligated to provide any such cooperation to the extent
such cooperation would cause the breach of any contract to which the Company or Intel or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates is a
party or any violation of applicable Law or that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or Intel or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, and (vii) in respect of financing support under this Section 8.7 for the Brookfield Member or proposed
Transferee of the Brookfield Member for a private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S of the Securities Act, as
applicable, the Brookfield Member or proposed Transferee of the Brookfield Member shall provide prior notice to the Company and its Subsidiaries of
such intended private placement: not less than 75 days prior to the launch of the first such private placement by either the Brookfield Member or a
proposed Transferee of the Brookfield Member, and thereafter (A) not less than 45 days prior to the launch of such private placement where the most
recent financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in such preliminary offering materials are audited financial statements, and
(B) not less than 60 days prior to the launch of such private placement
 
28
where the most recent financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in such preliminary offering materials are unaudited or interim
financial statements; provided, that in the event the Brookfield Member wishes to launch an add-on or supplemental offering of debt securities within 30
days or within 60 days after the most recent private placement of debt securities, and such add-on or supplemental offering requires the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide monthly interim financial information (but not updated quarterly or annual financial statements) and the review thereof need
only be on a ‘bringdown’ basis for the purposes of such add-on or supplemental offering, then such required prior notice period may be shortened to 15
days and 30 days, respectively, prior to the launch of such add-on or supplemental offering. The Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall not be required to execute any consent, resolution or document relating to any debt financing (or any refinancing thereof) incurred
by a Member or a proposed Transferee (eligible for such Transfer under the terms hereof) of any Transferring Member in connection with its investment
into the Company, including, without limitation, any indenture, credit agreement or other agreement, pledge or security document, or other certificates,
legal opinions or documents in connection with such debt financing or refinancing, and the definitive documentation relating to any such debt financing
(or refinancing) and any marketing materials relating to such debt financing (or refinancing), including, without limitation any rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, offering memoranda, lender presentation, road show materials or any other marketing materials, shall
provide that the financing is non-recourse to Intel and its Affiliates and the Company; provided, that Brookfield may describe the terms of the Main
Project Agreements (but shall not provide a copy of any such Main Project Agreements to any Person unless subject to confidentiality undertakings) in
such marketing materials. In no event shall the Company be required to: (x) pay any commitment or other fee in connection with any debt financing (or
any refinancing thereof) incurred by a Member or a proposed Transferee (eligible for such Transfer under the terms hereof) of any Transferring Member
in connection with its investment into the Company or (y) incur any liability (including due to any act or omission by Intel or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives) or expense in connection with providing any such financing cooperation or as a result of any information
provided by Intel, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection therewith, which, in each case
described in this subclause (y), is not reimbursed or indemnified by the applicable Member pursuant to this Section 8.7. The applicable Member
requesting financing cooperation pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall (A) promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including documented costs and expenses for compensation of applicable employees and agents and
related administration) incurred by the Company or its Representatives in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 8.7; and
(B) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against any and all claims, liabilities, taxes, damages, losses, costs and
expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any such debt financing (or refinancing) and the provision of any
information utilized in connection therewith and any financing cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 8.7, except, in each case, insofar as such
claims, liabilities, taxes, damages, losses, costs and expenses arose out of or resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Company of
its Representatives.
(b) The Brookfield Member shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, execute any agreement with any lender that lends to the
Brookfield Member in connection with the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, which agreement prohibits such lender
from lending to parties other than the Brookfield Member or any of its Affiliates in connection with any semiconductor fab developed by Intel or any of
its Affiliates in Ohio in which the Brookfield Member or any of its Affiliates invests.
 
29
(c) The Intel Member may reasonably request from the Brookfield Member from time to time, but in no event more than three (3) times in
any calendar year, information on the identity of the debt financing sources for any existing debt financing of the Brookfield Member at such time
(“Existing Debt Facilities”) and, subject to any confidentiality obligations of the Brookfield Member contained in or relating to such Existing Debt
Facilities, the Brookfield Member shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonably promptly the identity of the initial purchasers or
initial lenders under such Existing Debt Facilities and any other Persons that accessed Confidential Information in connection with the process related
thereto, in each case, unless such information has been previously provided (it being understood and agreed that (i) the information required to be
provided under this Section 8.7(c) shall be limited to that readily available and known to the Brookfield Member (which information, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall exclude information that is not accessible or customarily provided to the Brookfield Member regarding Persons that have accessed
Confidential Information through electronic platforms, arrangers, underwriters or Persons with similar roles in connection with such Existing Debt
Facilities, whether owing to standard bank or syndication practices or procedures, or the discretion of such arrangers, underwriters or Persons with
similar roles, or otherwise) and (ii) the Brookfield Member shall not be required to provide information regarding any transfers or assignments by the
initial purchasers and initial lenders under such Existing Debt Facilities).
ARTICLE 9
TAX MATTERS
Section 9.1 Partnership Representative. Unless and until another Member is designated as the “partnership representative” within the meaning of
Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (the “Partnership Representative”) by the Board, the Partnership Representative of the Company will be the Intel
Member. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 8 hereof, the Partnership Representative shall (i) keep the other Members promptly informed
about any communications with any Governmental Entities in connection with any income or other material tax audit or proceeding of the Company,
(ii) consult with the other Members in connection with any such audit or other proceeding about strategy and give the other Members the opportunity (at
the sole cost and expense of such Members) to attend any meetings with the Governmental Entities in such audit or other proceeding and (iii) provide
the Members with an opportunity to review and comment on any material substantive written communications with such Governmental Entities relating
to such audit or other proceeding, in each case, to the extent any such Member could reasonably be expected to be adversely impacted by such audit or
proceeding. To the extent any settlement or compromise with respect to Company tax matters could reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate
and adverse impact on the Brookfield Member, the Partnership Representative shall not enter into such settlement agreement with any Governmental
Entities without the prior written consent of the Brookfield Member (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each
Member hereby agrees to use reasonable efforts (i) to take such actions as may be required to effect the Intel Member’s designation as the Partnership
Representative, (ii) supply to the Company, as reasonably requested by the Partnership
 
30
Representative, all reasonably accessible, pertinent information in its possession relating to the operations of the Company necessary to enable the
Company’s tax returns to be prepared and filed, and (iii) to cooperate to provide any information or take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by the Partnership Representative in order to modify any Imputed Underpayment Amount pursuant to Code Section 6225(c); provided,
however, that none of the Members shall be required to file any amended U.S. federal income tax return or comply with the alternative procedure
described in Code Section 6225(c)(2)(B), or pay any tax due in connection with such tax return in accordance with Code Section 6225(c)(2) or any
corresponding provision of applicable state or local law, in each case, without the prior written consent of such Member (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Section 9.2 Indemnity of the Partnership Representative. The Company will indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
Partnership Representative for all reasonable third-party expenses (including legal and accounting fees) incurred as Partnership Representative pursuant
to this Article 9 in connection with any administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to the tax liability of the Members attributable to their interests
in the Company.
Section 9.3 Tax Elections. Except as provided in Section 4.7(c), Section 6.4, Section 15.6 and this Section 9.3, the Partnership Representative
shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether to make, change or revoke any available election or decision relating to Company tax matters; provided,
that, without limiting Section 4.7(c), Section 6.4, Section 15.6 or this Section 9.3, the Partnership Representative shall consult with the Brookfield
Member prior to making any such election and consider any reasonable comments of the Brookfield Member in good faith. Each Member will upon
request by the Partnership Representative supply any information necessary to give proper effect to such election made in accordance with the prior
sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except with the prior consent of all of the Members, the Partnership Representative shall make an
election pursuant to Code Section 6226 with respect to an Imputed Underpayment Amount, and each Member shall comply with the requirements under
such section (and any Treasury Regulations or other guidance that may be promulgated or issued in the future relating thereto). It is intended that the
Members shall bear the economic responsibility for the payment of any taxes, penalties and interest paid by the Company in the same manner (to the
maximum extent possible) in which such adjustments would have been borne had the Company elected out under Code Section 6221(b).
ARTICLE 10
TRANSFER OF INTERESTS
Section 10.1 Restricted Transfer.
(a) No Member shall Transfer or permit the Transfer of any Units or all or any part of the economic or other rights that comprise such
Member’s interest in the Company, except (i) Transfers to a Permitted Transferee in compliance with this Article 10; provided, that if a Transfer to a
Permitted Transferee results in a covered transaction as that term is defined 31 C.F.R. Part 800, such Transfer shall require prior written consent of the
other Member, (ii) pursuant to the Intel Call Right as set forth in Article 12, and (iii) with the prior written consent of the Intel
 
31
Majority and the Brookfield Majority. Any attempted Transfer not in compliance with the terms of this Article 10 will be null and void, and the
Company will not in any way give effect to any such Transfer. Further, any Transfer in violation of this Section 10.1 shall result in a suspension of all
voting rights of the breaching Member, and all Board Members appointed by such Member shall be deemed immediately removed upon the occurrence
of such breach, in each case, until the earlier of the time at which (x) such Transfer is rescinded or (y) the Units subject to such impermissible Transfer
are Transferred to a Person permitted by this Agreement.
(b) Any Member who assigns any Units in the Company (any such Member, an “Assignor”) in accordance with this Article 10 or
Article 11 will cease to be a Member of the Company with respect to such Units or other interest in the Company represented by such assigned Units
and will no longer have any rights or privileges of a Member with respect to such assigned Units or such portion of its interest represented by such
assigned Units (but will still be bound by this Agreement in accordance with this Article 10, subject to Section 10.5), including the power and right to
vote (in proportion to the extent of the interest Transferred) on any matter submitted to the Members, and, for voting purposes, such interest will not be
counted as outstanding in proportion to the extent of the interest Transferred unless and until the transferee is admitted as a Member in accordance with
Section 10.3.
(c) Subject to the terms of this Article 10, any Person who acquires in any manner whatsoever any Unit (any such Person, an “Assignee”),
irrespective of whether such Person has accepted and adopted in writing the terms and provisions of this Agreement, will be deemed by the acceptance
of the benefits of the acquisition thereof to have agreed to be subject to and bound by all of the terms, conditions and obligations (but will be entitled to
none of the rights or benefits) of this Agreement that any transferor of such Unit of such Person was subject to or by which such transferor was bound.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no purported Transfer will be recognized (directly or indirectly) if such
Transfer is not taken in accordance with any mandatory CFIUS filing obligations in 31 C.F.R. Part 800.
Section 10.2 Permitted Transfers. The following Members, as applicable, will be entitled to Transfer such Member’s Units to a Person (a
“Permitted Transferee”) in accordance with the following and subject to the other provisions of this Article 10:
(a) Intel Permitted Transferees. Subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in this Agreement, the Intel Member shall be entitled
to Transfer, in each case, all or any portion of its Units:
(i) at any time, to a successor to Intel;
(ii) at any time, to a successor to all or substantially all of Intel’s foundry services business or assets;
(iii) at any time, to an Affiliate that is Controlled by Intel; or
 
32
(iv) following the date that is the earlier of (A) the date that the Budgeted Capital Contributions of the Brookfield Member have been
funded in full and (B) the Longstop Date (such earlier date, the “Lock-Up Date”), to any Person.
(b) Brookfield Permitted Transferees. Subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in this Agreement (including Section 10.4),
the Brookfield Member shall be entitled to Transfer all or any portion of its Units:
(i) at any time, indirectly to any (x) Affiliate that is Controlled by Brookfield or (y) unaffiliated Third Party equity financing source,
in each case, that both (A) is not an Intel Competitor or Affiliate thereof and (B) does not have direct participation or governance rights in, or
recourse to, the Company; provided, that in no event shall Brookfield cease to retain Control of a majority of the Units not owned by the Intel
Member as of the date hereof pursuant to this clause (i); provided, further, that (1) fund-to-fund Transfers amongst funds Controlled by Brookfield
and (2) the admission of any new partner or member (to the extent not an Intel Competitor or an Affiliate thereof), or the purchase, sale, transfer or
issuance of any interest in, any investment fund managed or Controlled by Brookfield or any Affiliate thereof (to the extent such transfer is made
to passive investors (none of which are an Intel Competitor or Affiliate thereof)), shall not be subject to the Transfer restrictions in Article 10 other
than Section 10.4;
(ii) at any time, indirectly to the collateral agent, trustee or other agent of any secured parties providing debt financing to the
Brookfield Member or any Affiliate thereof; provided, that (A) such agent transferee is not an Intel Competitor or Affiliate thereof and (B) any
subsequent Transfer by such agent transferee shall comply with the Transfer restrictions in Section 10.1, including compliance with the Intel
Member’s right of first offer pursuant to Article 11; or
(iii) following the Lock-Up Date, to a Brookfield Qualified Transferee, subject to Section 11.1; provided, that the Brookfield
Member shall not be in default under its obligations (as applicable) set forth in Section 2.6 to fund any Capital Calls issued prior to such time,
including with respect to all Budgeted Capital Contributions (including Overrun Commitments).
(c) Publicly Traded Securities. Transfers of publicly traded securities (including of Brookfield and Intel) shall not constitute Transfers of
the Members’ Units in violation of this Article 10.
Section 10.3 Transfer Requirements. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.1, no Transfer shall be permitted and, in the case of a direct Transfer,
no Assignee (including a Permitted Transferee) will be admitted to the Company as a Member unless the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) In the case of a direct Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, a duly executed written instrument of Transfer is provided to the Board,
specifying the Units being transferred and setting forth the intention of the Member effecting the Transfer that the transferee succeed to a portion or all
of such Member’s Units and status as a Member;
 
33
(b) Each of the following is true (and, except in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) below, if requested by the Board, an opinion of responsible
counsel (who may be counsel for the Company) is provided to it, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Board confirming the same):
(i) such Transfer would not violate the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky Laws applicable to the Company or the Unit
to be transferred;
(ii) such Transfer would not cause the Company to be considered a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704(b) of the Code;
(iii) such Transfer would not cause the Company to lose its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
(iv) such Transfer would not cause or reasonably be expected to cause disallowance of, disqualification from or otherwise reduce any
Economic Incentives attributable to a Member or the Company.
(c) In the case of a direct Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, the Member effecting the Transfer and such Permitted Transferee shall
execute any other instruments that the Board deems reasonably necessary or advisable for admission of the transferee, including the written acceptance
by such Permitted Transferee of this Agreement and such Permitted Transferee’s agreement to be bound by and comply with the provisions hereof and
confirmation that the representations and warranties in Article 15 are true and correct with respect to it; and
(d) The Member effecting the Transfer or the transferee shall (i) pay to the Company a transfer fee in an amount sufficient to cover the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the admission of such transferee and (ii) provide to the Company any
information necessary for the Company to make required basis adjustments and comply with tax reporting requirements.
Section 10.4 Certain Transfer Restrictions. No holder of a Unit shall Transfer or permit the Transfer of any Units to:
(a) any Intel Competitor or any other Person set forth on Schedule 10.4, other than with the prior written consent of the Intel Majority; or
(b) any Person if such Transfer would result in the failure of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 15.12 and
Section 15.13 as if such representations and warranties were made on the date of such Transfer.
Any such attempted Transfer not in compliance with this Section 10.4 shall be null and void and not give effect to any such Transfer.
Section 10.5 Withdrawal of Member. If a Member Transfers all of its Units pursuant to Section 10.1 and the Assignee of such interest is admitted
as a Member pursuant to Section 10.3, such Assignee will be admitted to the Company as a Member effective on the effective date of the Transfer or
such other date as may be specified by the Assignee when the Assignee is admitted
 
34
and, if such Assignor has not already ceased to be a Member pursuant to Section 10.1(b), then immediately following such admission the Assignor will
cease to be a Member of the Company. Upon the Assignor ceasing to be a Member, the Assignor will not be entitled to any Distributions from and after
the date of such Transfer. Notwithstanding the admission of an Assignee as a Member and except as otherwise expressly approved by the Board, the
Assignor will not be released from any obligations to the Company as a Member (or otherwise) existing as of the Transfer and which are intended to
survive such withdrawal of a Member, including the obligations set forth in Section 4.3, Section 8.5 and Section 14.1.
Section 10.6 Blocker Rights. Except in connection with the Intel Call Right, in connection with any Transfer of Units, at the request of the
Brookfield Member, the Members and the Company shall structure such transaction in a manner that results in a disposition of the securities in any
Blocker Corporation, rather than a disposition of the Units in the Company owned, directly or indirectly, by such Blocker Corporation, and the owners
of such securities in such Blocker Corporation shall be entitled to receive the same portion of the aggregate consideration that such Blocker Corporation
would have received had the Units in the Company owned, directly or indirectly, by such Blocker Corporation been sold or disposed of; provided,
however, the proceeds to be paid to such owners shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, to the extent the entity which interests are being sold has any
liabilities as of the closing of such Transfer that, in the absence of this proviso, would otherwise reduce the aggregate consideration payable to Members
in connection with such Transfer of Units. In connection with any conversion, recapitalization, restructuring or reorganization of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or Units in the Company or interests in any of its Subsidiaries) in order to undertake an initial public offering (an “IPO Restructuring”),
at the request of the Brookfield Member, such IPO Restructuring shall be structured in a manner that results in the merger or consolidation of any
Blocker Corporation into the public vehicle in a transaction intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the utilization of such Blocker Corporation
as the public vehicle, or otherwise structuring the transaction in a tax-efficient manner with respect to such Blocker Corporation and its shareholders.
Section 10.7 Amendment of Schedule 2.1. In the event of the admission of any transferee as a Member of the Company, the Board will promptly
amend Schedule 2.1 to reflect such Transfer or admission, as the case may be.
ARTICLE 11
RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER
Section 11.1 Procedures. Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section 11.1, if the Brookfield Member desires to Transfer all or any
portion of its Units (the “Offered Units”) pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iii), the Brookfield Member shall first offer the Offered Units to the Intel Member
in the following manner:
(a) The Brookfield Member shall provide written notice (the “ROFO Notice”) to the Intel Member stating the number and type of Offered
Units proposed to be Transferred by the Brookfield Member.
 
35
(b) Upon receipt of the ROFO Notice, the Intel Member shall have a period of up to forty-five (45) calendar days (the “ROFO Period”) to
submit to the Brookfield Member an offer to acquire the Offered Units by delivering a written notice (an “Intel Offer”) to the Brookfield Member stating
that it offers to acquire all (but not less than all) of such Offered Units on the terms specified in the Intel Offer, which shall (i) include the Intel
Member’s proposed purchase price per Offered Unit and for the Offered Units in the aggregate, (ii) be made on an “as-is, where-is” basis (but subject to
customary fundamental representations pertaining to organization, authority, no conflicts, valid title and ownership, and absence of violation or default),
(iii) be composed solely of cash consideration, (iv) not be subject to any financing contingency, and (v) be binding upon delivery and irrevocable by the
Intel Member until the end of the ROFO Consideration Period, subject to compliance with this Agreement and applicable Law.
(c) If the Intel Member delivers an Intel Offer within the ROFO Period, the Brookfield Member shall have a period of up to forty-five
(45) calendar days from such delivery (the “ROFO Consideration Period”) to determine whether it (i) accepts the Intel Offer, (ii) rejects the Intel Offer
and will retain the Offered Units, or (iii) rejects the Intel Offer and will seek to sell the Offered Units to a Brookfield Qualified Transferee on economic
terms more favorable the Brookfield Member in the aggregate to than those contained in the Intel Offer, and to deliver a written notice to the Intel
Member with notice of such determination (the date of such notice, the “Brookfield ROFO Determination Date”).
(d) If the Brookfield Member determines to accept the Intel Offer, then such Transfer of the Offered Units shall be consummated on a date
that is mutually agreeable to the Brookfield Member and the Intel Member (and in no event later than forty five (45) calendar days following the
Brookfield ROFO Determination Date). The Brookfield Member shall, subject to compliance with applicable Law, use commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary to consummate the Transfer of the Offered Units to the Intel Member, including
executing, acknowledging and delivering transfer agreements, sale agreements, escrow agreements, consents and any other documents or instruments.
(e) If, following compliance with this Section 11.1, either (i) the Intel Member declines to exercise its right of first offer during the ROFO
Period or (ii) the Brookfield Member rejects the Intel Offer and desires to sell the Offered Units to a Brookfield Qualified Transferee, then, in each case,
the Brookfield Member may, for a period ending one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following the Brookfield ROFO Determination Date, enter into
a definitive agreement to Transfer to a Brookfield Qualified Transferee any or all of the Offered Units for a price per Unit that is not less than the price
per Unit set forth in the ROFO Notice and on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Brookfield Member in the aggregate than the terms set forth
in the Intel Offer. If the Brookfield Member has not so entered into a definitive agreement to Transfer to a Brookfield Qualified Transferee within one
hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the Brookfield ROFO Determination Date, then the Brookfield Member shall be required to comply with the
provisions of this Section 11.1 in the event it desires to Transfer the Offered Units or all or any portion of other Units that are directly or indirectly
owned by the Brookfield Member.
Section 11.2 Limitation on Applicability. The provisions of this Article 11 shall not apply to Transfers of Units pursuant to Section 10.2 (other
than Transfers of Units pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iii)).

ARTICLE 12
INTEL CALL RIGHT
Section 12.1 Intel Call Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without any requirement to comply with the
restrictions on Transfer set forth in Section 10.1, but subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 12, at any time following the Lock-Up Date the
Intel Member shall have the right, but not the obligation (the “Intel Call Right”), to (a) cause a sale of all of the Units of the Company in a single
transaction to a Third Party (a “Forced Company Sale” and, the Units held by the Brookfield Member and Transferred pursuant to such Forced
Company Sale, the “Forced Transfer Units”) or (b) require the Brookfield Member to sell or cause to be sold to the Intel Member or one or more of its
Affiliates or to a Third Party (as designated by the Intel Member in its sole discretion) all of either (i) the Units held by the Brookfield Member (the
“Called Units”), or (ii) the equity interests in the Brookfield Member (the “Brookfield Called Equity”), in the case of either clause (a) or (b), for cash
consideration received by the Brookfield Member equal to the Call Price.
Section 12.2 Call Price.
(a) Subject to Section 2.6(d)(iii), Section 12.6 and Section 12.7, the purchase price with respect to any Forced Transfer Units, Called Units
or Brookfield Called Equity shall, in each case, be the amount that, if paid to the Brookfield Member, would result in an Intel Call Right exercise price
(the “Call Price”) in an amount equal to:
(i) the amount set forth on Schedule 12.2(a)(i) (the “Unlevered Call Price”), minus
(ii) the lesser of (A) the amount set forth on Schedule 12.2(a)(ii) (the “Maximum Fixed Amount”) and (B) any outstanding liabilities
of the Brookfield Member (if less than the Maximum Fixed Amount), excluding, in the case of clause (A) and (B), Breakage Costs and any
ordinary course payment obligations under Hedging Agreements arising under the Transferable Liabilities (the “Fixed Amount”), minus
(iii) as applicable:
1. in the event the Intel Member or its designee has elected to exercise the Intel Call Right with respect to the Called Units and
has made a Call Prepayment Election, an amount equal to the Brookfield Pro Rata Excess Payment Credits then in existence; or
2. in the event the Intel Member or its designee has elected to exercise the Intel Call Right with respect to the Brookfield Called
Equity, an amount (only if positive) equal to (A) the Brookfield Pro Rata Excess Payment Credits then in existence, minus (B) the cash owned by
the Brookfield Member, and indirectly transferred to Intel Member, at the time such purchase by the Intel Member is consummated.
 
37
(b) The Brookfield Member shall cooperate with the Intel Member in calculating the Call Price and, if the Intel Member is buying the
Called Units and is not assuming the Indebtedness of the Brookfield Member, the Brookfield Member shall facilitate the prepayment in full of such
Indebtedness (including, if requested by the Intel Member, shall cooperate to obtain payoff documentation and establish an escrow or other arrangement
to administer such prepayment concurrently with the consummation of the Intel Call Right). The Brookfield Member shall provide the Intel Member
such information as is reasonably requested by the Intel Member from time to time, in order to facilitate and inform the Intel Member’s consideration of
the Intel Call Right, which information shall include (i) a good faith estimate, relevant agreements (with relevant provisions identified), supporting
calculations and other reasonable information of the Breakage Costs in the event the Intel Member were to elect to repay any outstanding Transferable
Liabilities, and (ii) the terms and conditions upon, and the process by, which the Intel Member or its designee (as applicable) would assume the
Indebtedness of the Brookfield Member, in each case, in connection with its exercise of the Intel Call Right as of a date that may be proposed by the
Intel Member.
Section 12.3 Call Prepayment Election. If the Intel Member or its designee has elected to exercise the Intel Call Right and elects not to comply
with the terms of customary consents or conditions associated with the Transferable Liabilities and instead elects to repay in whole or in part any
Transferable Liabilities or such Transferable Liabilities become due and payable under the terms thereof as a result of such transaction (a “Call
Prepayment Election”), in addition to the Call Price, the Intel Member shall be required to pay to the Brookfield Member for the benefit of the
applicable creditors of such Transferable Liabilities (or directly to the administrative agent or other representative for such parties), any Breakage Costs
resulting from the prepayment of such Transferable Liabilities; provided, that the Intel Member and the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the
Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) shall share the first $100 million of Breakage Costs associated with Transferable Liabilities in
proportion to the Members’ respective Original Pro Rata Share (and no portion of such first $100 million of Breakage Costs shall be funded with any
portion of cash representing Excess Payment Credits), and thereafter the Intel Member shall fund any remaining Breakage Costs associated with the
Transferable Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, Breakage Costs with respect to any liabilities of the Brookfield Member or the Called Units in
excess of the Transferable Liabilities shall in all cases be solely the responsibility of the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called
Equity, its immediate owners).
Section 12.4 Documentation and Procedures.
(a) The Intel Member shall have the ability to exercise the Intel Call Right on or about (subject to extension if necessary to permit
approvals from Governmental Entities) the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter of the Company upon written notice to Brookfield Member ninety
(90) calendar days prior to such Business Day, with such transaction closing effective as of such Business Day (subject to extension if necessary to
permit approvals from Governmental Entities). In the event that the Intel Member determines to exercise the Intel Call Right, the Intel Member shall
deliver to each of the Brookfield Member and the Company a revocable written notice of its intention to so exercise the Intel Call Right, which notice
shall include the purchaser to which the Forced Transfer Units, Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable) will be transferred, whether the
Intel Member, one or more of its Affiliates or a Third Party (such notice, the “Intel Call Notice”).
 
38

provide the Intel Member with a written statement setting forth the Call Price, including a good faith estimate, relevant provisions, supporting
calculations and other reasonable information supporting the calculation thereof or otherwise reasonably requested by the Intel Member (such statement,
the “Call Statement”).
(c) Within fifteen (15) calendar days (or, if later, ten (10) calendar days before the date on which Brookfield Member must provide an
irrevocable prepayment notice to its creditors (or, if no such date exists, ten (10) calendar days prior to the final day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter))
after the Intel Member’s receipt of the Call Statement, and solely if the Intel Member determines to exercise the Intel Call Right, the Intel Member shall
provide the Brookfield Member with an irrevocable written notice that it intends to exercise the Intel Call Right and, if applicable, a Call Prepayment
Election.
(d) In the event that the Intel Member exercises the Intel Call Right pursuant to this Article 12 (other than in connection with a Brookfield
Default Call),
(i) the Brookfield Member shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or the Brookfield Called
Equity (as applicable), duly endorsed or accompanied by written instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Intel Member or the
applicable Transferee, duly executed by the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners);
(ii) the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) shall represent and warrant only
(A) that it is the sole beneficial and record owner of such Forced Transfer Units, Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable), (B) that
such interests are being validly transferred free and clear of all liabilities other than Transferable Liabilities (including Breakage Costs with respect
thereto) and Liens other than Liens securing Transferable Liabilities, (C) with respect to the due authorization, execution and delivery of any
agreement entered into in connection therewith, and (D) with respect to its authority to enter into such agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby without the consent or approval of any other Person, and shall otherwise agree to complete such transaction on customary
terms and conditions and pursuant to customary documents;
(iii) the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) shall cause all liabilities that are
not Transferable Liabilities and all Liens (other than Liens securing Transferable Liabilities) associated with the Forced Transfer Units, the Called
Units or the Brookfield Called Equity, as applicable, to be discharged prior to consummation of the Intel Call Right;
(iv) the Intel Member or the applicable Transferee of the Forced Transfer Units shall pay the applicable Call Price in immediately
available funds to a bank account or bank accounts of (as designated by) the Brookfield Member, subject to the consummation of the Transfer of
the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or the Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable);
 
39
(v) such Intel Call Right transaction shall be consummated on the last Business Day of applicable Fiscal Quarter unless otherwise
agreed by the Intel Member and the Brookfield Member, subject to extension if necessary to permit approvals from Governmental Entities; and
(vi) following the consummation of such Intel Call Right transaction, as applicable, (A) the Brookfield Member shall no longer be
entitled to any rights in respect of the Forced Transfer Units or the Called Units, including the right to any Distributions or payments by the
Company and shall thereupon cease to be a Member of the Company or (B) the immediate owners of the Brookfield Member shall no longer by
entitled to any rights in respect of the Brookfield Called Equity, including the indirect right to any Distributions or payments by the Company, and
shall thereupon cease to be owners of the Brookfield Member.
Section 12.5 Cooperation; Brookfield Debt Terms.
(a) The Brookfield Member shall, subject to compliance with applicable Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be
taken all such actions as may be necessary to consummate the Transfer of the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or the Brookfield Called Equity, as
applicable, to the Intel Member or its designee, including executing, acknowledging and delivering transfer agreements, sale agreements, escrow
agreements, consents and any other documents or instruments. At the closing of the purchase of the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or
Brookfield Called Equity, as applicable, the Brookfield Member shall deliver or cause to be delivered the certificates, if any, evidencing the number of
Forced Transfer Units, Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity, as applicable, to be purchased by the Intel Member or its designee, accompanied by
Unit powers duly endorsed in blank or duly executed instruments of transfer, and any other documents that are reasonably necessary or requested by the
Intel Member or its designee (as applicable) or, in the case of a Forced Company Sale, the Transferee of the Forced Transfer Units in order to transfer to
the Intel Member or its designee (as applicable) or such Transferee good title to the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity,
as applicable, to be transferred, free and clear of all Liens other than those imposed under this Agreement or, in the case of Brookfield Called Equity,
relating to Indebtedness to remain outstanding in accordance herewith.
(b) The Brookfield Member shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the general terms and conditions of Transferable Liabilities,
including with respect to prepayment rights, to be consistent with market terms for financings of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents as
of the date of this Agreement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the terms and conditions of the Transferable Liabilities to permit a
transfer of the Brookfield Member to the Intel Member or its designee (as applicable) without penalty, premium or modification of such terms or
conditions (other than administrative matters associated with such transfer, including the execution of a pledge of the equity in the Brookfield Member
by the Intel Member or its designee (as applicable)). Without limiting the foregoing, the Brookfield Member shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its financing to be prepayable without make-whole or premium, or to be subject to declining or reduced premium, in each case in connection
with the exercise of the Intel Call Right; provided, that such terms do not adversely impact the economic terms of such financing, as reasonably
determined by the Brookfield Member.
 
40
Section 12.6 Specified Award Call.
(a) If the Enacting Regulations, or the requirements of or agreement with an applicable Governmental Entity (in each case, pursuant to a
Specified Act) setting forth the terms and conditions of a Specified Award in writing, are issued prior to May 31, 2024 and provided that (i) Intel, its
Affiliates or the Company would fail to qualify for a material portion of any Specified Award as a direct result of the identity of any direct or indirect
equity owner of the Brookfield Member or the Brookfield Member’s ownership interest percentage in the Company, or (ii) the Company would be
required, in order to so qualify for a material portion of a Specified Award, to comply with conditions or obligations that are in conflict with the
Transaction Documents or the Brookfield Member or its direct or indirect owners would be required, in order to so qualify for a material portion of a
Specified Award, to comply with conditions or obligations which they are not required to comply with under the Transaction Documents (each, a
“Disqualification Trigger”), the Intel Member shall promptly provide notice to the Brookfield Member and the Company of the Disqualification Trigger.
Following receipt of such notice (it being understood and agreed that such notice will be deemed to have been received on the day following the Closing
Date for purposes hereof if the Enacting Regulations are issued prior to the Closing Date), each Member and the Company shall endeavor for a period of
the earlier of (x) 30 calendar days following receipt of such notice and (y) June 30, 2024 (the “Evaluation Period”) to review and evaluate a structure
proposed by the Intel Member that (A) does not result in a Disqualification Trigger and (B) is not adverse in any material respect (with any adverse
change to the economic or governance terms in the Transaction Documents as of the Contribution Agreement Execution Date to be deemed to be
material) to the Brookfield Member or its Affiliates compared to the structure contemplated by the Transaction Documents on the Contribution
Agreement Execution Date (collectively, a “Qualifying Structure”).
(b) If on or before the expiration of the Evaluation Period, the Brookfield Member, in its sole discretion, agrees to the Qualifying
Structure, the Brookfield Member and the Intel Member will implement any proposed changes, modifications or amendments to effect such Qualifying
Structure as soon as reasonably practicable, including by amending this Agreement pursuant to Section 18.1, subject to receiving any required approvals
for such amendment under any debt financing (and any refinancing thereof) of the Brookfield Member.
(c) Following the expiration of the Evaluation Period, if the Brookfield Member does not agree to the Qualifying Structure proposed by the
Intel Member, as the sole and exclusive remedy for Intel pursuant to this Section 12.6(c), the Intel Member and their respective Affiliates related to any
Disqualification Trigger, starting from the Closing Date until June 30, 2024, Intel Member shall have the right to exercise the Intel Call Right for all or
any portion of the Units held by the Brookfield Member (a “Specified Award Call”) by delivering to the Brookfield Member and the Company an Intel
Call Notice specifying that the exercise is being made pursuant to Specified Award Call and the portion of the Units of the Brookfield Member that the
Intel Member is electing to purchase (the “Specified Award Call Units”). The Call Price with respect to a Specified Award Call shall be equal to the
Specified Award Call Amount multiplied by the quotient of the Specified Award Call Units divided by the total number of Units held by the Brookfield
Member. The closing of the exercise of the Specified Award Call shall occur and be effective on the last day of the Fiscal Quarter in which the
expiration of the applicable Evaluation Period occurs, so long as the Evaluation Period expires at least 30 calendar days before the end of the Fiscal
Quarter (otherwise the closing shall occur on the last day of the immediately following Fiscal Quarter) and in no event shall the closing occur following
June 30, 2024.
 
41
(d) If on or before the expiration of the Evaluation Period, the Intel Member does not present a Qualifying Structure, or if Enacting
Regulations are issued after May 31, 2024, there shall be no changes to the terms set forth in the Transaction Documents, except as otherwise agreed by
the parties thereto pursuant to the terms set forth therein.
Section 12.7 Brookfield Default Call. In the event of an uncured default by the Brookfield Member pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and
following the sixty (60) calendar day cure period required under Section 2.6(d)(iii) (the last day of such period, the “Cure Period End Date”), the Intel
Member shall have the right to initiate its exercise of the Intel Call Right pursuant to this Section 12.7 (a “Brookfield Default Call”), as follows:
(i) The Intel Member shall have the right to exercise the Brookfield Default Call at any time during the sixty (60) calendar day period
following the Cure Period End Date by delivering to the Brookfield Member and the Company an Intel Call Notice (specifying that the exercise is
being made with respect to a Brookfield Default Call).
(ii) The Call Price with respect to a Brookfield Default Call shall be equal to the Brookfield Invested Capital Amount.
(iii) The closing of a Brookfield Default Call transaction shall be effective as of the date set forth in the Intel Call Notice, which shall
be no less than ten (10) calendar days following delivery of the Intel Call Notice (subject to extension if necessary to permit approvals from
Governmental Entities). At the closing of a Brookfield Default Call transaction:
(iv) the Brookfield Member shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable), duly
endorsed or accompanied by written instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Intel Member, duly executed by the Brookfield
Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) and accompanied by all requisite transfer taxes, if any;
(v) the Brookfield Member (or, in the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) shall represent and warrant
(A) that it is the sole beneficial and record owner of such Called Units or Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable), (B) that such interests are

Liens associated with the Called Units or the Brookfield Called Equity, as applicable, to be discharged prior to consummation of the Intel Call
Right;
 
42
(vii) the Intel Member shall pay the applicable Call Price in immediately available funds to a bank account or bank accounts of (as
designated by) the Brookfield Member, subject to the consummation of the Transfer of the Called Units or the Brookfield Called Equity (as
applicable); and
(viii) following the consummation of such Brookfield Default Call transaction, (A) the Brookfield Member shall no longer be
entitled to any rights in respect of the Called Units, including the right to any Distributions or payments by the Company and shall thereupon
cease to be a Member of the Company or (B) the immediate owners of the Brookfield Member shall no longer by entitled to any rights in respect
of the Brookfield Called Equity, including the indirect right to any Distributions or payments by the Company and shall thereupon case to be
owners of the Brookfield Member, as the case may be.
Section 12.8 Remedies. Without limitation to any other remedies available to the Intel Member, material breach by the Brookfield Member (or, in
the case of the Brookfield Called Equity, its immediate owners) of any of its (or their) obligations to discharge liabilities or Liens as required by this
Article 12, to fund a share of Breakage Costs as required by this Article 12, or as set forth in Section 16.1 or Section 16.2, shall result in a suspension of
all voting and Distribution rights of the Brookfield Member pursuant to this Agreement, and all Brookfield Managers shall be deemed removed
immediately upon the occurrence of such breach, in each case, until (a) the Intel Member either rescinds the exercise of its Intel Call Right or Brookfield
Default Call or (b) the Forced Transfer Units, the Called Units or the Brookfield Called Equity (as applicable) are transferred to the Intel Member or the
applicable Transferee, in each case, pursuant to this Article 12; provided that, in such case, the Call Price in respect thereof shall be reduced by an
amount, if any, by which the Breakage Costs have decreased as of such later date (as compared to the Breakage Costs as of the original date of such
exercise).
ARTICLE 13
DISSOLUTION OF COMPANY
Section 13.1 Termination of Membership. No Member may resign or withdraw from the Company except as otherwise set forth herein. The
expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of any Member or the occurrence of any other event that terminates the continued membership of any Member will
not in and of itself cause the Company to be dissolved or its affairs to be wound up, and upon the occurrence of any such event, the Company will be
continued without dissolution.
Section 13.2 Events of Dissolution. The Company will be dissolved upon the happening of any of the following events: (a) the entry of a decree of
judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of the Act, (b) subject to compliance with Section 6.4 and Schedule 6.4, the determination of the Board, (c) the
disposition of all of the Company’s assets or (d) the termination of the legal existence of the last remaining Member or the occurrence of any other event
which terminates the continued membership of the last remaining Member unless the business of the Company is continued in a manner permitted by
this Agreement or the Act.
 
43
Section 13.3 Liquidation. Upon dissolution of the Company for any reason, the Company will immediately commence to wind up its affairs. A
reasonable period of time will be allowed for the orderly termination of the Company’s business, discharge of its liabilities, and distribution or
liquidation of its remaining assets so as to enable the Company to minimize the normal losses attendant to the liquidation process. The Company’s
property and assets or the proceeds from the liquidation thereof will be distributed so as not to contravene the Act and will be otherwise distributed to
the Members in accordance with their positive Capital Account balances. A full accounting of the assets and liabilities of the Company will be taken and
a statement thereof will be furnished to each Member promptly after the distribution of all of the assets of the Company. Such accounting and statements
will be prepared under the direction of the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if upon a dissolution and
termination of the Company and after taking into account all allocations of Net Profit and Net Loss, there remains a deficit in any Member’s Capital
Account, then gross items of income, gain, deduction and loss for Capital Account purposes for such Fiscal Year (and to the extent permitted by
Section 761(c) of the Code, gross items of income and gain for Capital Account purposes for the prior Fiscal Year) shall be allocated so as to eliminate,
to the extent possible, the deficit balance in any Member’s Capital Account in proportion to such deficit.
Section 13.4 No Action for Dissolution. The Members acknowledge that irreparable damage would be done to the goodwill and reputation of the
Company if any Member should bring an action in court to dissolve the Company under circumstances where dissolution is not required by
Section 13.2. This Agreement has been drawn carefully to provide fair treatment of all parties and equitable payment in liquidation of the Units of all
Members. Accordingly, except where the Board has failed to liquidate the Company as required by Section 13.3 and except as specifically provided in
Section 18-802 of the Act, each Member hereby waives and renounces its right to initiate legal action to seek dissolution or to seek the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to liquidate the Company.
Section 13.5 No Further Claim. Upon dissolution, each Member will have recourse solely to the assets of the Company for the return of such
Member’s capital, and if the Company’s property remaining after payment or discharge of the debts and liabilities of the Company, including debts and
liabilities owed to one or more of the Members, is insufficient to return the aggregate Capital Contributions of each Member, such Member will have no
recourse against the Company, the Board or any other Member.
Section 13.6 First Offer and Cooperation Rights. In connection with any transfer of property or assets of the Company in a dissolution of the
Company or otherwise without the approval of the Intel Managers, Intel Member shall first have the right to purchase any or all of such property or
assets at Fair Value and, if Intel Member does not purchase any such assets, the Company shall provide commercially reasonable assistance and
cooperation to Intel Member to identify and to sanitize or otherwise remove the Intel Member’s or any of its Affiliates’ Intellectual Property from any
assets being distributed to a Member other than Intel Member or transferred to a Third Party, including the Intel Member Confidential Information, from
any or all such property or assets prior to such distribution, transfer or dissolution, as applicable.

ARTICLE 14
DUTIES
Section 14.1 Business Opportunities. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity and any analogous doctrine will
not apply to any Exempted Person. The Company, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Economic Incentives with respect to any other project) that are known or from time to time presented to an Exempted Person, including with respect to
those set forth on Schedule 14.1. Each Exempted Person who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement, Economic
Incentive or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a) will not have any duty to communicate or offer such
opportunity to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) will not be liable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to the equityholders of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries because such Exempted Person pursues or acquires for, or directs such opportunity to, itself or another Person or
does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Section 14.2 Reliance, etc. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, an Exempted Person acting under this Agreement shall not be
liable to the Company for such Person’s good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever in this Agreement any Member or Board
Member (in each case, other than a Person who is also an officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) is permitted or required to
make a decision (a) in such Person’s discretion or under a grant of similar authority, such Person shall be entitled to consider only such interests and
factors as such Exempted Person desires, including the interests of such Person’s and Affiliates thereof, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Company, any Member, any Board
Member or any other Person, or (b) in such Person’s good faith or under another express standard, such Person shall act under such express standard and
shall not be subject to any other or different standards; provided, however, that the Board Members shall not take any actions in contravention of their
duties set forth in Section 14.3.
Section 14.3 Duties. Without limiting the applicability of any other provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 14.1 and the
other provisions of this Section 14.3 the following provisions, as applicable, shall be applicable to the Board and the members thereof in their capacity
as members of the Board and to officers of the Company:
(a) The Board and the members thereof and the decisions of the Board shall have the benefit of the business judgment rule to the same
extent as the Board, such members and such decisions would have the benefit of such rule if the Board were a board of directors of a Delaware
corporation.
(b) No Board Member, in his or her capacity as a Board Member, shall have any fiduciary or other duty to the Company, any Member, any
other Board Member or any other Person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement other than the implied contractual covenant of good
faith and fair dealing and other than such Board Member’s express obligations
 
45
under this Agreement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, whenever a Board Member, in his or her capacity as a Board Member, is
permitted or required to make a decision or take an action or omit to take an action (including wherever in this Agreement that any Board Member is
permitted or required to make, grant or take a determination, a decision, consent, vote, judgment or action at its “discretion,” “sole discretion” or under a
grant of similar authority or latitude), such Board Member shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors, including his or her own (or those
of the Member that appointed such Board Member), as such Board Member desires, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to
any other interest or factors whatsoever.
(c) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, no Board Member shall be liable to the Company, to any Member or to any other
Board Member for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission (in relation to the Company, any transaction, any investment
or any business decision or action, including for breach of duties including fiduciary duties) taken or omitted by such Board Member, unless there has
been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of such act or omission, and taking
into account the acknowledgments and agreements set forth in this Agreement, such Board Member engaged in bad faith, fraud or willful or intentional
misconduct or criminal wrongdoing; provided, however, the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise affect (i) the scope or applicability of Investor
Liabilities or (ii) a Board Member’s liability with respect to a breach of the express terms of this Agreement applicable to such Board Member.
(d) Any Board Member, in his or her capacity as a Board Member, shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement and on the
advice of counsel, accountants and other professionals that is provided to the Company or such Board Member, and such Board Member shall not be
liable to the Company or to any Member for such reliance on this Agreement or such advice; provided, however, that there has not been a final and
non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of such reliance, and taking into account the
acknowledgments and agreements set forth in this Agreement, such Board Member engaged in bad faith, fraud or willful or intentional misconduct or
criminal wrongdoing.
(e) Officers of the Company (other than officers serving in a national security or similar capacity) shall have customary fiduciary duties
and waivers that would apply to officers of a corporation in Delaware.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 14.3, the limitations set forth herein shall not eliminate the implied contractual
covenant of good faith and fair dealing or limit the duties or obligations of any Member or Board Member who is also an officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from performing such duties in accordance with any employment or similar agreement, any policies or procedures
applicable to such Person in such capacity or any duty or obligation in such capacity arising under applicable Law.
 
46
Section 14.4 Board Member Indemnification.
(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 14.4(f), the Company shall indemnify any Board Member who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
by reason of the fact that such Person is a Board Member (each, a “Proceeding”), against any and all losses, claims, expenses (including reasonable
out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees), costs, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
Board Member in connection with such Proceeding; provided, however, that such Board Member shall not be indemnified by the Company if there has
been a final and nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which such Board
Member is seeking indemnification hereunder, and taking into account the acknowledgments and agreements set forth in this Agreement, such Board
Member committed bad faith, fraud or willful or intentional misconduct or criminal wrongdoing. Any indemnification provided hereunder shall be
satisfied solely out of the assets of the Company (including available insurance coverage, if any), as an expense of the Company and, accordingly, no
Board Member shall be subject to personal liability by reason of these indemnification provisions.
(b) Except as provided in Section 14.4(c), any indemnification under this Section 14.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of a Board Member is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 14.4(a). The determination of whether a Board Member has met the standard of
conduct that entitled it to indemnification hereunder shall be made by the Board. To the extent that a Board Member has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 14.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Board Member shall be
indemnified against expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Board Member in
connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
(c) Upon written request by a Board Member, the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred (or reasonably expected
to be incurred) by such Board Member in defending or investigating a Proceeding in advance of (a) the final disposition of such Proceeding and (b) the
determination of whether such Board Member has met the standard of conduct that entitles such Board Member to indemnification hereunder; provided,
however, prior to payment (or advancement) by the Company of any such expenses, the Board Member shall provide an unsecured undertaking to the
Company to repay all such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that such Board Member is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as
authorized by this Section 14.4; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company be required to pay or advance to any Board Member any amounts
in connection with a Proceeding initiated by (i) such Board Member, (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the Intel Member or any of its
Affiliates (in the case of any Intel Manager) or (iv) the Brookfield Member or any of its Affiliates (in the case of any Brookfield Manager).
(d) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Section 14.4 shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, contract, a vote of the
Board or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The provisions of this Section 14.4 shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any Person who is not specified in Section 14.4(a), but whom the Company has the power or obligation to indemnify under the
provisions of the Act or otherwise.
 
47
(e) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 14.4 shall, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of a Board Member. Any amendment, modification
or repeal of this Section 14.4(e) or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on liability of the Board
Members, or terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Board Members, under and in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 14.4 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 14.4 to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to indemnify a Board Member
appointed by the Brookfield Member in connection with liabilities that constitute Investor Liabilities, except to the extent the Brookfield Member makes
an Investor Liability Contribution and then, such indemnification obligation shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the Investor Liability
Contribution.
ARTICLE 15

ARTICLE 16
COVENANTS OF THE MEMBERS
The applicable Member(s) hereby covenant to, and agree with, the other Members and the Company, severally and not jointly and solely on its
own behalf, as follows:
Section 16.1 Hedging Agreements. Other than Hedging Agreements in respect of interest rates associated with floating-rate Indebtedness, the
Brookfield Member shall not enter into any Hedging Agreements. The Brookfield Member shall not at any time permit the notional balance of interest
rate Hedging Agreements to which it is a party or otherwise subject as of any date to exceed the sum of (a) the notional principal amount of any floating-
rate Indebtedness to which the Brookfield Member is a party or otherwise subject as of such date and (b) the notional principal amount of any floating-
rate Indebtedness to which the Brookfield Member reasonably anticipates it will become a party.
Section 16.2 Brookfield Member. The Brookfield Member is, and at all times shall be, treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
Section 16.3 Enforcement of Affiliate Contracts. The Intel Member shall administer and enforce the Transaction Documents and all other
contracts entered into by or on behalf of the Company with Intel Member or any of its Affiliates (collectively, the “Affiliate Contracts”), on behalf of the
Company. The Intel Member shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to (if applicable), terminate the Affiliate Contracts due to (x) the Intel Member’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) the Company’s failure to perform with respect to any Change Order initiated by Intel or
one of its Affiliates without the consent of Brookfield Member. To the extent there is a payment breach under any Affiliate Contract, the Brookfield
Member shall be entitled to claim damages on behalf of the Company from Intel under such Affiliate Contract (or, to the extent Intel is not the
counterparty to such Affiliate Contract, the Intel-Affiliated counterparty to such Contract), and such damages shall be (a) in the amount that would have
been received by the Company but for such payment breach and (b) held and accounted for, and permitted to be used or distributed by the Company, in
each case, in the same manner as such amounts would have been held, accounted for and used or distributed if such Affiliate Contract had not been
breached.
Section 16.4 Ownership of Units. Each of the Members is, and at all times shall remain, in material compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting their ownership of the Units and status as a Member of the Company.
Section 16.5 Economic Incentives. Each Member agrees that it shall reasonably consider Economic Incentives suggested by any Member, and that
the Board may cause the Company to pursue such Economic Incentives (in the case such Economic Incentives constitute Indebtedness, to the extent
mutually consented to by the Intel Member and Brookfield Member); provided, that no such application or receipt of Economic Incentives may
expressly prohibit or expressly limit quarterly Distributions of Available Cash in accordance with Section 4.1(b)(i)(3); provided, further, that
performance and payment obligations associated with Economic Incentives shall not be deemed to be an express limitation or prohibition on such
Distributions of Available Cash to
 
51
the extent they do not reduce expected Available Cash and do not adversely impact the Brookfield Member. Subject to the foregoing, the Intel Member
may cause the Company to comply with the CHIPS Act, the FABS Act and other applicable Laws or regulations that would make the Intel Member or
its Affiliates (including the Company) eligible for Economic Incentives. For the avoidance of doubt, any disallowance or recapture of Economic
Incentives (other than to the extent arising from an Investor Liability or a Transfer in violation of Section 10.3 or an action or inaction by the Brookfield
Member or its Affiliates in violation of Section 16.6) will be borne solely by the Intel Member and funded by the Intel Member via an Unbudgeted
Capital Contribution to the extent required for the Company to pay costs due and payable by it.
Section 16.6 Specified Awards.
(a) The Brookfield Member, its Affiliates and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Intel all information or
documents reasonably requested by Intel to support its efforts to apply for a Specified Award, and any information or documents requested by the U.S.
Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) or other applicable Governmental Entity in connection with such an application, subject to the Brookfield
Member and its Affiliates confidentiality policies and obligations and applicable contractual restrictions and applicable Law; provided, that the
Brookfield Member and its Affiliates may submit business confidential information directly to Commerce or any other applicable Governmental Entity
in connection with such requests. For purposes of this Section 16.6(a), with respect to Brookfield, “Affiliate” shall be limited to the Brookfield Fund
Entities and any Subsidiary thereof and the Brookfield Fund GPs, in each case, excluding portfolio companies that have not received any Confidential
Information or otherwise been involved in the consideration or negotiation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
(b) The Brookfield Member shall promptly notify the Intel Member in writing of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Entity relating to a Specified Award or application for a Specified Award and permit the Intel Member to review in advance any
proposed written communication by the Brookfield Member or the Company to any Governmental Entity in connection therewith, to the extent
permitted by Law and subject to customary confidentiality protections. The Brookfield Member shall not agree to participate in any meeting (including
by video conference or telephone) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any matter relating to a Specified Award or application for a Specified
Award unless it consults with the Intel Member in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and applicable Law, gives the Intel
Member the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the terms and conditions related to confidential, proprietary or
commercially sensitive information that are contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (“Confidentiality Provisions”), each
Member will reasonably coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other Member
and the Company may reasonably request in connection with preparing, and responding to requests from Governmental Entities about, any applications
by the Company for Specified Awards.
(c) Intel, the Intel Member and the Company’s sole remedies for any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 16.6(a) and
Section 16.6(b) by the Brookfield Member or any of its Affiliates shall be (i) specific performance or (ii) the exercise by the Intel Member of a Specified
Award Call to the extent such remedy is available pursuant to Section 12.6.
 
52
(d) Prior to May 31, 2024, the Intel Member, Intel and its Affiliates, in connection with the Arizona Fab, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to advocate for the Enacting Regulations to not include a Disqualification Trigger. The Members shall periodically consult with each
other regarding advocacy strategies and material developments in connection with the Enacting Regulations.
(e) None of the Brookfield Member or any of its Affiliates shall take, fail to take, or permit to be taken, any action that would cause such
Person to be in breach of the following representations and warranties:
(i) All of the equity interests in Brookfield are owned, directly or indirectly, by (A) the Brookfield Fund Entities and (B) Brookfield
Infrastructure Partners L.P., a Bermuda limited partnership. The Brookfield Fund GPs directly or indirectly Control Brookfield and each of the
Brookfield Fund Entities, and no Person (other than Brookfield Asset Management Inc. via the Brookfield Fund GPs) holds any “control” (as
defined pursuant to 31 CFR § 800.208 as of the date hereof) rights with respect to Brookfield or any of the Brookfield Fund Entities.
(ii) In the five (5) years prior to the date hereof, none of Brookfield or its Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors or officers,
general partners, managers, employees or, to the Knowledge of Brookfield, agents, in each case acting on behalf of Brookfield or its Affiliates:
(A) has, directly or indirectly violated any applicable Anti-Corruption Laws or Ex-Im Laws, (B) has been, nor is, a Restricted Person or a
Sanctioned Person, (C) transacted business or had any dealings with or for the benefit of any Restricted Person or Sanctioned Person nor
otherwise violated Sanctions, or (D) has received any allegation, inquiry, notice or communication that alleges that the Company, Brookfield or
any Person acting for or on behalf or at the direction thereof may have violated any Anti-Corruption Laws, Sanctions, or Ex-Im Laws, and is not
aware of any such circumstances presently in existence likely to give rise to any such allegation, inquiry, notice or communication. To the
Knowledge of Brookfield, no capital contribution to the Brookfield Fund Entities by a limited partner has been derived from any illegal or
illegitimate activities.
(iii) (A) The Brookfield Fund Entities have not contributed to Brookfield or the Company capital from an individual limited partner
or other passive investor in the Brookfield Fund Entities who is (1) a government of, (2) an entity organized under the laws of or having its
principal place of business in, or (3) a citizen or lawful permanent resident of any “foreign country of concern,” within the meaning of
Section 103(a)(4) of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, H.R. 4346 (as in effect on the Contribution Agreement Execution Date and with the
parties’ acknowledgment and agreement that no country is listed under Section 103(a)(4)(B) of such Act as of the Contribution Agreement
Execution Date), if any, in excess of five percent (5%) of the aggregate amount of capital contributed from limited partners of the Brookfield Fund
Entities to Brookfield or the Company, (B) the aggregate amount of capital contributed from the Brookfield Fund Entities to Brookfield or the
Company from such limited partners and/or passive investors described in the foregoing clause (A) is less than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate
amount of capital contributed from the Brookfield Fund Entities to Brookfield or the Company and (C) no Person directly or indirectly holds or
has otherwise acquired any economic or voting interest in Brookfield or the Company, other than as a direct result of (and in proportion to) capital
contributions made by the Brookfield Fund Entities to Brookfield or the Company (as applicable) on behalf of such Person.
 
53
(iv) Neither Brookfield nor any of its Affiliates is a “foreign entity of concern” within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 4651(6) (as such
term is in effect on the Contribution Agreement Execution Date and with the parties’ acknowledgment and agreement that no entity is listed under
15 U.S.C. § 4651(6)(E) as of the Contribution Agreement Execution Date).
For purposes of this Section 16.6(e), the term “Affiliate” shall have the meaning given to such term in the Contribution Agreement.
Section 16.7 Licenses and Permits. Each Member agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in providing such
information, in signing such documents and in taking any other action as may reasonably be requested by the Company in connection with obtaining any
federal, state, local or foreign license or permit needed to operate its business or the business of any entity in which the Company invests.
Section 16.8 Indemnities. Each Member agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the other Members from and against
all losses, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and charges) resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty
or agreement of such Member in this Agreement or any misrepresentation by such Member in this Agreement. In the event the acts or omissions of a
Member give rise to any indemnification obligation of the Company under the Contribution Agreement, such Member shall make a Capital Contribution
in cash to the Company (for no additional Units) in the amount of such indemnification obligation (an “Indemnity Payment Contribution”) and the
Company shall pay such indemnification obligation in accordance with Section 4.1(f).
Section 16.9 DCSA. Each Member agrees to use reasonable best efforts to comply with the NISPOM and to submit all applicable and required
information and take all required actions to comply with the NISPOM, applicable national or industrial security regulations, and any relevant Foreign
Ownership, Control, or Influence (“FOCI”) related requirements and similar requirements included in any Government Contract. The Members agree to
use reasonable best efforts to minimize the nature and burden of FOCI or CFIUS mitigation including taking actions and agreeing to certain limitations
consistent with this Agreement to reduce the burden of any required FOCI or CFIUS mitigation; provided, that the foregoing shall in no way limit,
restrict, hinder, or otherwise impede the Brookfield Member’s ability to designate at least one (1) director to the Board or restrict the Brookfield
Member’s access to information or reporting that would limit, restrict, hinder, materially delay, or prevent the Brookfield Member from providing
required information or reports to its or its Affiliates’ lenders.
Section 16.10 Intel Parent Guaranty. If, subject to the terms and conditions of that certain Parent Guaranty, made by Intel in favor of the Company,
dated as of the date of the Contribution Agreement (the “Intel Parent Guaranty”), the Brookfield Member makes a claim under the Intel Parent Guaranty
in respect of the payment of any Company Net Liability, the proceeds from any payment by Intel in connection with such claim shall be placed in the
Extraordinary Proceeds Account, and the Brookfield Member shall be entitled to cause the Company to use such proceeds to satisfy such Company Net
Liability.

Section 19.4 Execution of Documents. Each Member, including any new and substituted Member, by the execution of this Agreement or by
agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement, irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Board or any Person designated by the Board to act on such
Member’s behalf for purposes of this Section 19.4 as such Member’s true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in such Member’s
name and stead to execute, deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate public offices such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry
out this Agreement, including:
(a) all certificates and other instruments (specifically including counterparts of this Agreement), and any amendment thereof, that the
Board deems appropriate to qualify or to continue the Company as a limited liability company in any jurisdiction in which the Company may conduct
business or in which such qualification or continuation is, in the opinion of the Board, necessary to protect the limited liability of the Members; and
(b) all amendments to this Agreement adopted in accordance with the terms hereof and all instruments that the Board deems appropriate to
reflect a change or modification of the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The appointment of each member of the Board as such Member’s attorney-in-fact to act on its behalf for purposes of this Section 19.4 will be deemed to
be a power coupled with an interest, in recognition of the fact that each of the Members under this Agreement will be relying upon the power of the
Board to act as contemplated by this Agreement in any filing and other action by him, her or it on behalf of the Company, and will survive the
bankruptcy or dissolution of any Member giving such power and the transfer or assignment of all or any part of such Member’s Units; provided,
however, that in the event of a Transfer by a Member of all of its Units, the power of attorney given by the transferor will survive such assignment only
until such time as the transferee will have been admitted to the Company as a substituted Member and all required documents and instruments will have
been duly executed, filed, and recorded to effect such substitution.
Section 19.5 Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction
and venue of the state and federal courts located in Delaware in connection with any action relating to this Agreement and agree that service of
summons, complaint or other process in connection with any such action may be made as set forth in Section 19.3 and that service so made will be as
effective as if personally made in the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
 
57
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
Section 19.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination shall not
affect the other provisions hereof, each of which shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not contained herein.
Such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any valid and enforceable application thereof, and each such provision shall be deemed to be
effective, operative, made, entered into or taken in the manner and to the full extent permitted by Law.
Section 19.7 Construction. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, the principle of contra proferentum shall not apply to this Agreement and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 19.8 Table of Contents, Headings. The table of contents and headings used in this Agreement are used for administrative convenience only
and do not constitute substantive matter to be considered in construing this Agreement.
Section 19.9 No Third Party Rights. Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
Company, the Board and the Members and no other Person, including creditors of the Company, will have any right or claim against the Company, the
Board or any Member by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof or be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Exempted Person not otherwise party to this Agreement shall be an express third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.
Section 19.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto recognize that irreparable injury may result from a breach of any provision of this
Agreement and that money damages may be inadequate to fully remedy the injury. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of one or
more of the provisions of this Agreement, any party which may be injured (in addition to any other remedies which may be available to that party) shall
be entitled to seek one or more preliminary or permanent orders (a) restraining and enjoining any act which would constitute a breach or (b) compelling
the performance of any obligation which, if not performed, would constitute a breach, all without the need to post a bond and in an expedited hearing.
Without liming the foregoing, (i) the Intel Member shall have the right to seek enforcement on behalf of the Company of the indemnity of the Brookfield
Member pursuant to Section 4.1(e) and the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the Brookfield Member shall have the right to seek enforcement on
behalf of the Company of the Intel Parent Guaranty.
 
58
Section 19.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents, each Member’s respective purchase agreement, Contribution
Agreement or unit certificate and the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby constitute the entire agreement of the Members and their
Affiliates relating to the Company and supersede all prior meetings, communications, representations, negotiations, contracts or agreements (including
any prior drafts thereof) with respect to the Company, whether oral or written, none of which will be used as evidence of the parties’ intent. In addition,
each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that all prior drafts of this Agreement contain attorney work product and will in all respects be subject to the
foregoing sentence.
Section 19.12 Effect of Waiver or Consent. A waiver or consent, express or implied, to or of any breach or default by any Person in the
performance by that Person of its obligations with respect to the Company is not a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the
performance by that Person of the same or any other obligations of that Person with respect to the Company. Failure on the part of a Person to complain
of any act of any Person or to declare any Person in default with respect to the Company, irrespective of how long that failure continues, does not
constitute a waiver by that Person of its rights with respect to that default until the applicable statute-of-limitations period has run.
Section 19.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts with the same effect as if all signing parties had signed the
same document. All counterparts will be construed together and constitute the same instrument. This Agreement, each Member’s respective purchase
agreement, Contribution Agreement or unit certificate and the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of electronic delivery (i.e., by email of a PDF signature page), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of an electronic
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated electronically as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.
Section 19.14 Business Days. If any time period for giving notice or taking action hereunder expires on a day which is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday in the State of Delaware, or the jurisdiction in which the Company’s principal office is located, the time period will automatically be extended to
the Business Day immediately following such Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
Section 19.15 Survival. Section 5.1, Section 8.5 and Article 13 will survive and continue in full force in accordance with their terms
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the dissolution of the Company.
Section 19.16 Gender. Any reference to the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter genders unless the context
otherwise requires.
