Distribution
 
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers,
jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with
skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.
 
Research and Patents
 
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s 
activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit
growth. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.7
63
 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014 and $1.715 billion in 2013.
Research and development, covering basic scientific
 
research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $1.
22
3 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150 billion in 2013. Related expenses
primarily include technical support
; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and
maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses
associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.
 
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous
U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by
new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent
grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,
which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in
the country.
 
The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or
group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments. The importance of
patents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in
Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Raw Materials
 
In 
2015
, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel
, due largely to the significant
price
 decreases in crude oil
. This 
in turn 
dr
ove
 year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based
materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to
meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such
shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material
inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply
contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.
 
Environmental Law Compliance
 
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to
continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to
environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 1
4
, Commitments and
Contingencies).
 
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and
reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or
approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital
6
 
Table of Contents
 
projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
 
In 
2015
, 3M expended about 
$
26
 million
 for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for
remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are
expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant
improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed
or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s 
emphasis on
 environmental responsibility, 
capital
expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about 
$51
 million over the next two years
for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
 
While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for
environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may
also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to
shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.
Words such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could
,”
“
forecast
”  
and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include,
among others, statements relating to
:
·
the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial
performance, and market position,
·
worldwide economic and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial conditions
of our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters 
or climate change 
affecting the operations of the Company or our
suppliers and customers,
·
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,
·
the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
·
the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
·
future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
·
future availability of and access to credit markets,
·
pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,
·
asset impairments,
·
tax liabilities,
·
information technology security, and
·
the effects of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we
operate.
 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking
statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among
others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,”
“Financial Condition and Liquidity
” and annually in
 
“Critical Accounting Estimates
.
”  
Discussion of these factors is incorporated by
reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors
that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K filed
 with the SEC from time to time.
 
Item 1A. 
Risk Factor
 
s.
 
Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion
of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II,
 
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
 
* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic
, political,
 and capital markets conditions.
 The Company
operates 
in more than 70 countries and
 
derives 
approximately 60 percent of
 its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s
business is subject to global competition 
and geopolitical risks 
and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as 
slower economic growth, 
disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of
either contained or widespread recessionary
9
 
Table of Contents
 
conditions, 
inflation, 
elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, 
government deficit reduction and other austerity measures
in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries
 in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific
countries or regions; natural and other disasters
 or climate change 
affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or
adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates,
 tax 
laws,
 or 
exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings
and other 
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
 
* 
Change in t
he Company’s credit ratings 
could increase cost of fund
ing
.
 
The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of
capital
.
 
The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. 
The Company has an AA-
credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s Investors
Service. 
This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which includ
e financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as
transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have 
served to
 lower 
3M’s 
borrowing
costs and 
facilitate 
access to a variety of lenders. 
The Company’s
 ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure, financed with
additional low-cost debt, could impact 3M’s credit rating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely
affect the Company’s cost of fund
ing
 and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
 
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
 Demand for the Company’s products, which
impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the
Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of
inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in
the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our
products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the
demand for some of the Company’s products.
 
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its
sales and earnings. 
Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 
60 percent
 of the
Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected
growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
 
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its
ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
 This ability may be adversely affected by
difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property
protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
 
* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials
and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency
exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.
 The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy
(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its
supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained
interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the
Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able
to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
 
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving
business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. 
The Company monitors its business portfolio and
organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its
organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions,
10
 
Table of Contents
 
future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.
 The Company
utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma,
 
and engages in ongoing global business transformation
. Business transformation
 is defined
as 
changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business model
s
 to improve operational
efficiency and productivity, while allowing 
3M
 to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by 
the ongoing multi-
year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis
.
 
There can be no assurance that all of the
projected productivity improvements will be realized.
 
* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP
system 
as part of business transformation 
on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the
Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the
Company and its customers
,  
suppliers
, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s
business and reputation. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of
which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business
processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may
have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and
customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and
systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information
technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,
employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers
including cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an
extended period, up to and including several years. While we
 have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats
to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company.
There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events
could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s
reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various
cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
 
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our
results.
 The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.
Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant
legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely
impact its results of operations and cash flows.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those
involving product liability, antitrust,
 intellectual property,
 environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,
anti-corruption, or other matters.
 The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the
outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the
Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant
regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future
charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. For a more
detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 1

OVERVIEW
 
3M is a diversified 
global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. 
As described in Note
16
,  
effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division,
which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.
 
3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial;
Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to
Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.
 
Restructuring actions:
 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on
structural overhead, largely in the U.S., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on EMEA and Latin America. This impacted
approximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or
$0.14 per diluted share.

For total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per
diluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price
increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed
above) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety
and Polypore Separations Media acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of
the library systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven
by average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The
income tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year
to 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled “Results of Operations”
for further discussion.
 
For total year 2014, net income attributable to 3M was $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per
diluted share, in 
2013
, an increase of 11.5 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include a significant benefit from the
combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus profit leverage on organic volume growth. Foreign exchange
impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 15 cents per diluted share. The income tax rate was 28.9 percent in 2014
, up
0.
8 percentage points versus 2013, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 8 cents. Weighted-average diluted shares
outstanding in 2014 declined 4.6 percent year-on-year to 662.0 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 34
cents.
 
Fourth-quarter 2015 sales and operating income results:
 
 
Fourth-quarter 2015 net income attributable to 3M was $
1.038
 billion, or $
1.66
 per diluted share, compared to $1.179 billion, or $1.81 per
diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth-quarter 2015 sales totaled $
7.3
 billion, a 
de
crease of 
5.4
 percent from the fourth quarter
of 2014. 3M achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in 
Health Care, and
Consumer, with declines in Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy
. Organic local-currency sales increased 
4.5
 percent
in 
Health Care
, led by 
health information systems, food safety, oral care, drug delivery systems, and critical and chronic care.
 
Organic local-
currency sales increased 
2.7
 percent in the Consumer business segment, with positive growth in
 the 
construction and home improvement
business,
 stationery and office supplies, and home care, while consumer health care declined. Organic local-currency sales declined 1.8
percent in Industrial, with sales growth in 3M purification and automotive OEM more than offset by declines in industrial adhesives and
tapes, abrasives, and advanced materials.
 
Organic local-currency sales declined 2.5 percent in Safety and Graphics, with sales declines in
personal safety partially offset by sales growth in roofing granules, and 
commercial solutions, 
while traffic safety and security was flat
.
Electronics and Energy organic local-currency sales growth 
declined
 
7.7
 percent, with 
de
creases in electronic-related sales in both
electronics materials solutions, and display materials and systems. Energy-related 
organic local-currency sales declined in 
renewable energy
,
communications markets
, and electrical markets
. For the Company in total, organic-local currency sales 
declined 1.1
 percent, with 
organic
volume declines of 2.3 percent partially offset by 
higher 
selling prices
 
which added
 
1.2
 percent. Acquisitions added 
1.9
 percent to sales,
which related to the 
March 
201

 acquisition of 
Ivera Medical Corp. (Ivera), the August 2015 acquisition of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L.
(Capital Safety), and the August 2015 acquisition of Polypore International Inc.’s Separations Media business (Polypore)
.  
Divestitures
reduced sales by 0.4 percent, related to the January 2015 sale of the global static business, and the fourth quarter sale of the license
converting business in France, along with substantially all of the library systems business. 
Foreign currency translation reduced sales by

percent year-on-year.
 
From a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 
2015
 organic local-currency sales gr

1.1 percent in EMEA. Organic local-currency
sales declined 0.4 percent in the United States, 0.6 percent in 
Latin America/Canada, 
and 2.7 percent 
in Asia Pacific
.
 
In EMEA, 
Central/East
Europe showed solid local-currency sales growth in the quarter, while West Europe 
was up slightly, and Middle East/Africa declined.
Organic local-currency sales in the United States 
declined, as 3M experienced weak end-market demand in its industrial-related businesses.
The consumer-oriented businesses (Health Care and Consumer) continued to deliver positive organic growth. 
Organic local-currency sales
in Latin America/Canada 
declined. In Latin America, Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7 percent, while
Brazil declined 6 percent.
 Organic local-currency sales in Asia Pacific
 declined 2.7 percent. Three of five

business groups posted positive growth in the Asia Pacific region, led by Health Care and Consumer, while Electronics and Energy
declined. Within Asia Pacific, organic local-currency sales declined by 3 percent in both Japan and China/Hong Kong.
 
 
Operating income in the fourth quarter of 
2015

 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 
2014
, a
de
crease of 
1.0

ew
 5.8 percent in Health Care, 5.4 percent in Safety and
Graphics, 5.2 percent in Electronics and Energy, 4.9 percent in Industrial, and 3.9 percent in Consumer. From a geographic area perspective,
2014 organic local-currency sales gr
ew
 6.3 percent in Asia Pacific, 4.9 percent in the United States, 4.5 percent in Latin America/Canada,
and 3.2 percent in EMEA. For the Company in total, organic local-currency sales grew 4.9 percent, with higher organic volumes
contributing 3.9 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.0 percent. Acquisitions added 0.1 percent to sales, driven by the Treo

Operating income in 2014 was 22.4 percent of sales, compared to 21.6 percent of sales in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. These
results included a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, lower pension/postretirement
benefit costs, and profit leverage on organic volume growth. These factors were partially offset by strategic investments and other factors.

Financial condition:
 
3M 
generated $6.4 billion
 of operating cash flow in 
2015
, a
 de
crease of $
206
 million when compared to 
2014
. This followed an increase of
$
809
 million when comparing 
2014
 to 
2013
. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a
discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 201
6
, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
10
 billion of 3M’s
outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company’s February
 
201
4
 repurchase program. This new program has no pre-established
end date. In 
2015
,  
2014, and 2013, 
the Company purchased 
more 
than $5 billion
 of 
its own 
stock
 each 
year. The Company expects to
purchase $4 billion to $6 billion of its own stock in 2016. In February 2016, 3
M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 201
6
 dividend
of $
1.11
 per share, an increase of 
8
 percent. This marked the 5
8
th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M’s debt to total capital
ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 
48
 percent at 
December 31, 2015
,  
34
 percent at 
December 31, 2014,
 and 
25 percent at
December 31, 2013
.  
T
he Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard
 
& Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a
negative outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. 
The Company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital
markets to meet its funding needs
.

Raw materials:
 
In 
2015
, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel
, due largely to the significant
price decreases in crude oil
. This 
in turn 
dr
ove
 year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based
materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. 
To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to
meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such
shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material
inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply
contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.
 
Pension and postretirement defined benefit
/contribution 
plans:
 
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 86 percent funded at year-end 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension
plan, which is approximately 69 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans
were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2015
for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan was 0.7%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to
manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016
is 7.50%, down 0.25% from 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2015 discount rate was 4.47%, up 0.37 percentage
points from the year-end 2014 discount rate of 4.10%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected
benefit obligation (PBO), however the plan’s funded status decreased slightly in 2015 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate
than the plan assets returned in 2015. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in
Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).
 
3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
in 2016. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. 3M expects
global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other)
to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and
Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.
 
Beginning on January 1, 2016, 
with respect to defined contribution plans,
 the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions
for U.S. employees
. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates
of 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation will be matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The
reduction in the company’s match is anticipated to reduce 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $35 million.

The Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external
service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business model
s
 to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing
3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, as discussed within the Overview section above, 3M incurred restructuring charges impacting operating
expenses as follows:

Cost of Sales:
 
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
 
Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 50.9 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 2014. Cost of sales as a
percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net
sales by 1.1 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, higher pension
and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales) and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges, increased cost of sales as a
percent of sales.
 
Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.7 percent in 2014, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from 2013. Cost of sales as a
percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net
sales by 1.0 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 1.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, lower pension and
postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), along with organic volume leverage, decreased cost of sales as a percent of
sales
.
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. The
translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars reduced SG&A expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which
reduced worldwide sales by 
6
.
8
 percent. This foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement
expense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4
percent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $85 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2014 when compared to 2013. Year 2014
included strategic investments in business transformation, while lower pension and postretirement expense benefitted SG&A. SG&A,
measured as a percent of sales, decreased 0.4 percentage points to 20.3 percent in 2014, compared to 20.7 percent of sales in 2013.
 
Research, Development and Related Expenses:
 
Research, development and related expenses (R&D) decreased $7 million, or 0.4 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. R&D increased 3.2
percent in 2014 compared to 2013. 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation,
which refers to innovation which has the potential to create new markets and disrupt existing markets. In 2015, like SG&A, R&D spending
in U.S. dollars was reduced due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. These 2015 translation benefits were partially offset
by higher pension and postretirement expense in 2015 when compared to 2014. In 2014, increases in R&D, when compared to 2013, were
partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2015, compared to
5.6 percent in both 2014 and 2013.

Operating income margins were 22.9 percent in 2015 compared to 22.4 
percent 
in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. These results
included a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, and a benefit from productivity
and other items. These benefits w
ere
 partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs, 2015 restructuring charges, higher
strategic investments, and acquisition and divestiture impacts. Strategic investments include in
cremental programs around 
disruptive R&D
and
 business transformation. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media
acquisitions, and the divestitures of substantially all of the 
l
ibrary 
s
ystems business
, along with 
the license plate converting business in
France.
 
 
Operating income margins were 22.4 percent in 2014 compared to 21.6 
percent 
in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. These results
included a 
significant b
enefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs. In addition, lower year-on-year
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
and 
profit leverage on organic volume growth 
provided benefits
. Items that reduced operating
income margins included strategic investments, which included investments in disruptive R&D, business transformation, the supply chain
center of expertise in Europe, and portfolio management actions. The Company invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio management
actions to position 3M for greater success. Foreign currency effects 
and acquisition impacts (Treo) 
reduced operating income margins.

Interest Expense
:  
Interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, despite significantly higher debt levels, helped by lower
average interest rates. 
Interest expense
 
decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, 
again 
despite higher debt levels, primarily due to lower U.S.
borrowing costs as debt maturities were replaced with lower cost financing from commercial paper and lower interest rates on new debt
issuances.
 
Capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. The
amounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of $

The effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points.  The effective tax
rate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points.  The changes in the rates between
years are impacted by many factors, as described further in Note 8.
 
The Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.5 percent. The
 rate can vary from
quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors,
such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests
in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which
was 3M’s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 
6
, on September
 
1, 2014, 3M
purchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited, bringing 3M’s ownership to 100 percent. Thus, effective
September
 
1, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. The primary remaining noncontrolling
interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.
 
Currency Effects:
 
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased 
pre-tax
 income
 
by approximately 
$390
 million and
$
100
 million in 201
5
 and 201
4
, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars;
the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains
and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping
Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses 
increased 
pre-tax
income by approximately 
$
180 
million 
and $10 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Refer to Note 1

 in the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities.
 
 
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are
provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
.  
As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the
Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M
Unitek divisions.
 
3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics;
Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.

Table of Contents
 
Corporate and Unallocated:
 
In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the
preceding business segments table and in Note 1
6
. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate
investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and
environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation)
that the Company 
determines
 not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous
items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $104 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by
higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to
Corporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below
table. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&D 
cost
absorption by
 the five business segments, resulting in less 
under-absorbed 
expense being allocated to Corporate.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $70 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. This decrease was driven by lower
pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which declined year-on-year by $162 million. Of this reduction, $116 million was allocated to
Corporate and Unallocated. This was partially offset by higher Corporate and Unallocated expenses related to year-on-year increases in
annual incentive plan expenses and legal accruals.

Operating Business Segments:
 
Each of 3M’s business segments incurred restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, as indicated in the preceding table. In 2014,
each business segment absorbed additional cost related to incremental investments related to business transformation, enabled by 3M’s
global ERP implementation, which impacted each of the five business segments 2014 annual operating income margins by approximately
0.2 percentage points when compared to 2013.
 
Information related to 3M’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic
volume impacts plus selling price impacts. Acquisition impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months of the
acquisition. The divestiture impacts, if any, foreign currency translation impacts and total sales change are also provided for each business
segment. Any references to EMEA relate to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.

The Electronics and Energy segment serves customers in electronics and energy markets, including solutions that improve the
dependability, cost-effectiveness, and performance of electronic devices; electrical products, including infrastructure protection;
telecommunications networks, and power generation and distribution. This segment’s electronics solutions include film solutions for the
electronic display industry; packaging and interconnection devices; high performance fluids and abrasives; high-temperature and display
tapes; flexible circuits, which use electronic packaging and interconnection technology; and touch systems products, which includes touch
screens, touch monitors, and touch sensor components. This segment’s energy solutions include pressure sensitive tapes and resins;
electrical insulation; infrastructure products that provide both protection and detection solutions; a wide array of fiber-optic and copper-
based telecommunications systems; and renewable energy component solutions for the solar and wind power industries.
 
The display materials and systems business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M
provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld
devices such as cellular phones and tablets 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. 
The display materials and systems business
includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of
exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M’s multi-layer optical film patents 
expired at the end of 2013 and will
expire over several years thereafter
, 3M will likely see more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical
films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M’s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a
competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA
 
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the
Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic
area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are
exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s
results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.
Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 1

Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America/Canada. 3M is continuing to increase its manufacturing and sourcing
capability, particularly in developing economies, in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic
areas. 3M will continue to make investments in critical developing markets, such 
as Brazil, China, Mexico, Panama, Poland, Southeast Asia,
and Turkey.
 Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
 
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement
obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical
accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
 
Legal Proceedings:
 
The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates
of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled “Process
for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in
Note 1
4
) for additional information about such estimates.

Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
 
3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United
States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for
its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard
Codification (ASC) 715, 
Compensation — Retirement Benefits
, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the
amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit
pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the
year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While
the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining
pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
 
Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at
retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for
services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting
benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the
yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle
projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan
’
s benefit obligation was 
also 
used for the
calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and 
interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M change
d
 the
method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new
method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation.
Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is
determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not
affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses
recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company chang
ed
 to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and
interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company
account
ed
 for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the change to the spot
yield curve approach, 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by $180 million.
Including this $180 million, 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements,
curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.

 significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan
assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the
expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, 0.25% lower than 2015. Refer to Note 11 for information on
how the 2015 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for

international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected
long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.77% for 2016, compared
to 5.90% for 2015.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement
expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $55
6
 million, up from $391 million in 2014. Defined
benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to
decrease to approximately $
236
 million in 2016, a decrease of $320 million compared to 2015.

Asset Impairments:
 
As of 
December 31, 2015
, net property, plant and equipment totaled 
$8.5 billion
 and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $
2.6
 billion.
Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over
long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses.
These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance,
expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the
related asset group.
 
3M goodwill totaled approximately $
9.2
 billion as of 
December 31, 2015
. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the
fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.
Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have
similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units
for impairment testing.
 
An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for
 
the reporting unit multiplied by a
price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio
approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash
flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, 
in addition to businesses where the
price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M
 also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for
businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.
 
As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care
Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.
 For
 any product moves that resulted in reporting unit
changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During
the 
third
 quarter of 201
5
, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this
new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 201
5
 annual
impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
 
As of October 1, 2015, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill.
These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M 
p
urification (which
36
 
Table of Contents
 
includes the Polypore Separations Media acquisition), Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems,
Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety (which includes
the Capital Safety acquisition), and Traffic Safety and Security. The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying
value by approximately 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value
exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M’s market value at both September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, was
significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $12 billion at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
 
In 2015, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting
units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using
projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The
weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.
 
3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on
research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill
associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting
units.
 
Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in
competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in
Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing
results. As indi
cated above, during the third
 quarter of 201
5
, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment
for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a
definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset
group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived
assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 201
6
 for any triggering events or
other indicators of impairment.
 
Income Taxes:
 
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude
of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions
and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records
tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, regarding uncertainty in
income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing
facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that
is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be
less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less
than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company
determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
 
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
37
 
Table of Contents
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
 
3M continues 
its transition to a better-optimized
 capital structure 
and is adding 
leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of
3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable 
the Company to implement
this strategy. 
Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3M will continue to deploy capital towards
research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by
complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for
 cash
availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient
to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those
international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for
U.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S.
taxes to repatriate them. See Note 
8
 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
 
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 
The Company
 believes it will
have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $3
billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.
 
Net Debt:
 
The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its
components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The
following table provides net debt as of 
December 31, 2015
 and 
2014

At 
December 31, 2015
, 3M had $

 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately 
$1.7 billion was
held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $200 million was hel
d by the United States. Of the $
1.7
 billion held internationally, U.S.
dollar-based cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 
$355 million
, or 
21
 percent, which was invested in money market
funds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other high quality fixed income securities. At
December 31, 2014
, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the United States
totaled approximately $
3
.3 billion and 
less than $100 million,
 respectively.
 
The Company’s total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.4 billion lower at 
December 31, 2015
 when
compared to 
December 31, 2014
. 3M was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow
generation and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.

ebt:
 
The Company’s total debt was $
4.0
 billion higher at 
December 31, 2015
 when compared to 
December 31, 2014
. The strength of 3M’s
capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity
profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 
T
he Company has
an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard
 
& Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s
Investors Service. 
The Company’s ongoing transition to a 
better-
optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could
impact 3M’s credit rating in the future.
 
Effective May
 
16, 2014, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement, which registers an
indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated August
 
5, 2011. In
June
 
2014, in connection with the May
 
16, 2014 shelf registration, 3M re-commenced its medium-term notes program (Series
 
F) under
which 3M may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes
. Included in this $9 billion are $
8.17
 billion
(utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt) 
of notes previously issued in 2011
,
2012, 2014, and 2015
 as part of Series F.
 
Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is
included in Note 10.
 
In August
 
2014, 3M amended and extended 
its
 existing $1.5 billion five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement to a $2.25 billion
five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, with an expiration date of August
 
2019. This credit agreement includes a provision
under which 3M may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion, bringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lenders’ discretion). This
facility was undrawn at 
December 31, 2015
. Under the $2.25 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to
Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of
consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At
December 31, 2015
, this ratio was approximately 
56
 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
 
Apart from the
committed facilities, a
n additional $2
41
 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees were also issued and
outstanding at 
December 31, 2015
. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
 
Balance Sheet:
 
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going
forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
 
Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term
liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $
3.868
 billion at December
 
31, 201

with $
6.339

The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These
measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled
measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts
receivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at year-end —
multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 
4.9

Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
 
The Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as
annualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net
assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures used by other companies. ROIC was 
22.5
 percent for 
2015
, and 2

Cash Flows:
 
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences
and other items can significantly impact cash flows.
 
In 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $206 million compared to 2014. Operating cash flows decreased due to $
363
million in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year
working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46
million in
 
2015
, compared to increases of $
306
 million in 
2014
, with the year-on-year improvement related to
 lower organic volume growth.
Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.
 
In 
2014
, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $809 million compared to 
2013
. Operating cash flows benefited year-on-year
from increases in net income including noncontrolling interest, lower pension and postretirement plans contributions, and lower year-on-
year working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by
$306 million in 
2014
, compared to increases of $407 million in 
2013
, with the year-on-year improvement 
partially due to 
higher receivable
and inventory turns
.
 Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.

Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
 
In addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of
performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and
free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be
considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant
and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for
discretionary expenditures. 3M defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. Below find a
recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing
manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending was $1.4
61
 billion in 
2015
, compared to $1.
493
 billion in 
2014
 and $1.
665
 billion in 
2013
. The
Company expects 2016 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.
 
3M invests in renewable and maintenance programs, which pertains to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current
capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M
also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus
research facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities.
 
In 2015,
 investments included new sites and buildings, investments in IT, continued expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus
the sustainment of existing facilities, in addition to other initiatives. Specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story,
400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. In addition, 3M continued its investments it IT systems and
infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system.
 
In 2014, investments in growth across geographies included production equipment, new sites and buildings, capacity investments,
converting, and distribution, and other growth initiatives. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, including an ongoing
multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis

In both 2015 and 2014, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan
and Korea in 2015. 
In 2015, repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition
(refer to Note 2). 
In 2014, repayment of debt primarily includes repayment of a Eurobond in July
 
2014 totaling 1.025 billion Euros
(approximately $1.4 billion carrying value), repayment of the three-year 66 million British Pound committed credit facility agreement
entered into in December
 
2012, and repayment of other international debt. In 2013, repayment of debt related to the August

2013 issuance of an eight-year Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros.
 Refer to Note 10
for additional discussion of debt.
 
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate
purposes. In February 201
6
, 3M’s Board of Directors auth
orized the repurchase of up to $10
 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock,
which replaced the Company’s February
 
201
4
 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. 
In 2015, 2014, and
2013, the Company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year. 
The Company expects full-year 201
6
 gross share
repurchases will be in the 
range of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
For
 more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
 
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled 
$2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015, 
$2.216 billion ($3.42 per share)
 in 2014
,
 and
 $1.730
billion ($2.54 per share) in 
2013
. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. 
In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter
2016 dividend of $
1.11 
per share, an increase of 
8  
percent. This is
 equivalent to an annual dividend of $
4.44 
per share and marked the 58th
consecutive year of dividend increases.
 
On September
 
1, 2014, 3M purchased (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) Sumitomo Electric Industries,
 
Ltd.’s 25 percent interest in 3M’s
consolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese Yen. Upon completion of this transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of
Sumitomo 3M Limited. This was reflected as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated statement
of cash flows. In addition, in April
 
2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an
immaterial amount, which was also classified as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated
statement of cash flows.
 
In March
 
2013, 3M sold shares in 3M India Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in return for $8 million. The noncontrolling interest
shares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in India. This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities
regulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a
result of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent. The $8 million received in the
first quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
In addition to the March
 
2013 sale of noncontrolling interest described above, other cash flows from financing activities may include
various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
 
As of 
December 31, 2015
, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer
to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 1
4
 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
 
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify
either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or
the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s
maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Long-term debt payments due in 2016 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling $126 million (classified as current portion of long-term
debt), and $96 million (included as a separate floating rate note in the long-term debt table), respectively, as a result of put provisions
associated with these debt instruments
. Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest
rate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of 
December 31, 2015
.
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the
Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital
commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one
year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts,
in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive
consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the
preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending in 
2016
 and beyond. The
purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the
Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-
alone basis.
 
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the
current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid
 
out in cash in the next 12 months.
The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or
decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $
208
 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to
Note 
8
 for further details.
 
As discussed in Note 1
1
, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 201
6
and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore,
amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks
using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these
arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply
contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.
44
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk,
interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
 
Item 7A. 
Quantitative
 
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management
provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives,
and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to
control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company
actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks
and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
 
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:
 
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may
cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency
earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange
rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may
dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. 
Beginning in the second quarter
of 2014
,
 3M began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the
forecasted transactions from a previous term of 
12
 months to a longer term of 
24
 months
, with certain currencies being extended further to
36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015.
 In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in
hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing
arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward
contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign
operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash
flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were $
2.8
 billion and $
5.4
 billion, respectively, at 
December 31, 2015
. As of
December 31, 2015
, the Company had 
974
 million Euros 
and 248 billion South Korean Won 
in notional amount of foreign currency
forward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 
3.6
 billio
n Euros in principal amount of 
foreign currency denominated
debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 1
2
 in the “Net Investment
Hedges” section.
 
Interest Rates Risk:
 
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest
expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that
are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the
difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar
equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2015
 was $
1.8
 billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note 
10
, including references to
information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt.
 
45
 
Table of Contents
 
Commodity Prices Risk:
 
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M
used 
commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions 
to manage price volatility, but discontinued this
practice 
in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive
income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.
 
Value At Risk:
 
The value at risk analysis is performed annually
 to assess the Company’s
 
sensitivity
 to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and
commodity prices
.
 A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the 
impact on
 after-tax earnings related to f
inancial instruments
(primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at 
December 31, 2015
. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95
percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies, interest rates
related to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be
experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would
not materially impact the results.
 
The risk of loss or benefit associated with exchange rates was higher in 2015 due to a greater mix of
floating rate debt and a rising interest rate environment in the U.S.
 Interest rate volatility increased in 2015, based on a higher mix of
floating rate debt and the use of forward rates.
 The
 following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax
earnings related to these exposures.

In addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates, recent historical
information is as follows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, had the following effects on
 pre-tax
income: 
2015
 ($
390
 
million decrease)
 and 
2014 ($
100
 million decrease). This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local
currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and
abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the
negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains
and losses had the following effects on 
pre-tax
 income: 
2015
 ($
180
 
million increase) and
 
2014
 ($
10
 million 
in
crease).
 
An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price
change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $
70
 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent
price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $
40
 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs
used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.

Management’s Responsibility
 
 for Financial Reporting
 
Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the
financial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment.
 
Management has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This
system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified
personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control
over financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to
require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the
accounting and control system.
 
3M Company
 
Management’s Report
 
 on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management
conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013
)
.  
Management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group
S.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in
purchase business combinations. 
These acquired business
es
’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent
and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
2015.
 Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year
of acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Based on
the assessment,
 management concluded that, as of 
December 31, 2015
, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
 
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015
 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015
.

Report
 
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
3M Company and its subsidiaries
 
(the “Company”) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 
(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for marketable securities and
deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2015.
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. (“Capital
Safety”) and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media Business (“Polypore Separations Media”) from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because 
these businesses were
 acquired by the Company in purchase business combination
s
 during
2015.  We have also excluded Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Capital Safety
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of Polypore Separations Media whose total assets and
total net sales, in the aggregate, represent less than 
2
 percent and less than 
1
 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
NOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies
 
 
Consolidation:
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries
are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
Basis of presentation:
 Certain balances relative to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to December 31, 2015 presentation in
connection with the following, each of which is further discussed in the indicated section of Note 1:
·
Change in method of classification of certain marketable securities previously classified as 
non-current
 to current as further
discussed in the Marketable securities section; and
·
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, 
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
, and ASU
No. 2015-17, 
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
, in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis as further
discussed in the New Accounting Pronouncements section.
 
Foreign currency translation:
 Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and
liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and
expense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
 
Although local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the United States, under Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 830, 
Foreign Currency Matters
, the reporting currency of a foreign entity’s parent is assumed to be that entity’s
functional currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly inflationary—generally when its cumulative inflation is
approximately 100 percent or more for the three years that precede the beginning of a reporting period. 3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela
with operating income representing less than 1.0 percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2015. Since January 1, 2010, the
financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiary have been remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent.
 
The Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local
currency. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government
announced that the National Center for Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX), had assumed the role with respect to the continuation of the
existing official exchange rate, significantly expanded the use of a second currency auction exchange mechanism called the Complementary
System for Foreign Currency Acquirement (or SICAD1), and issued exchange regulations indicating the SICAD1 rate of exchange would
be used for payments related to international investments. In late March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a third foreign
exchange mechanism, SICAD2, which it later replaced with another foreign currency exchange platform in February 2015 called the
Marginal System of Foreign Currency (SIMADI). The SIMADI rate was described as being derived from daily private bidders and buyers
exchanging offers through authorized agents
. This rate is
 approved and published by the Venezuelan Central Bank.
 
The financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the official CENCOEX (or its predecessor) rate into
March 2014, the SICAD1 rate beginning in late March 2014, the SICAD2 rate beginning in June 2014, and the SIMADI rate beginning in
February 2015. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate
the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing
and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange
mechanism. Other factors notwithstanding, remeasurement impacts of the changes in use of these exchange rates did not have material
impacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
 
The Company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its Venezuelan subsidiary. Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange
mechanisms may continue in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net
monetary assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of
55
 
Table of Contents
 
December 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of net monetary 
liabilities
 denominated in VEF of less than 500 million VEF and the
CENCOEX, SICAD (formerly SICAD1), and SIMADI exchange rates were approximately 6 VEF, 13 VEF, and 200 VEF per U.S. dollar,
respectively.
 
A need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated
cash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M
monitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability
to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and
economic situation within Venezuela. Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015, the Company continues to consolidate its
Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its equity balance
are not significant.
 
Reclassifications: 
Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
 
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less
when acquired.
 
Marketable securities:
 Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method of classification of certain securities previously
classified as non-current to current. This new method classifies these securities as current or non-current based on the nature of the securities
and availability for use in current operations while the prior classification was based on management’s intended holding period, the
security’s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. The Company believes this method is preferable because it
is consistent with how the Company manages its capital structure and liquidity. The prior period balance has been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation:

3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC
320
, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities
, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-
temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of
shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed
as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future
cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.
 
Investments:
 Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale
investments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
 
Other assets: 
Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the
balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums
paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life
56
 
Table of Contents
 
insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of
marketable securities and investments,” respectively.
 
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
 
Property, plant and equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at
cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives
of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the
range of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the
majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until
disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from
disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be
recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over
its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Conditional asset retirement obligations: 
A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional
asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using
expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs
are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $102 million and $96
million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Goodwill: 
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested
for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level
below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic
characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized
when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of
a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by
using a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a
reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to
apply Step 0 for 2015 or prior
 period annual goodwill assessments
.
 
Intangible assets: 
Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets
acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a
systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,
with customer related largely between seven to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based
largely between two to fifte
en
 years, definite lived tradenames largely between thr
ee
 and twenty years, and other intangibles largely
between two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in
“Research, development and related expenses.”
 
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The
57
 
Table of Contents
 
amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for
impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that
the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value
of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
 
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract
termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. 
Employee-related
severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in
the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated
actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination
dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the
employees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end
of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred
under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.
 
Revenue (sales) recognition:
 The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no
material concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to
customers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. The Company records
estimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at
the time of the initial sale. These sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, 
Revenue Recognition
. The estimated
reductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the
various markets served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most
common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. Free goods are
accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
 
The vast majority of 3M’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the
product or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements (such as
equipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and conditions.
 
For non-software multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone
value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights.
Arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. The selling price used for each
deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to
establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded
until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the
functionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.
 
For arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant
production, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is recognized when the Company has
VSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. When the
arrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional
performance is generally employed.
 
58
 
Table of Contents
 
For prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence
indicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized
until the inception of the license term.
 
On occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For these agreements,
and depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to
date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
 
Accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company
maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and
product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales
returns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and
historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant
off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
 
Advertising and merchandising:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $368 million in 2015, $407 million
in 2014 and $423 million in 2013.
 
Research, development and related expenses:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line
of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014
and $1.715 billion in 2013. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific
advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.
223
 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150
billion in 2013. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees
incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research
and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method
effects and impairments.
 
Internal-use software:
 The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of internal-use software. Amounts
capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis
is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases
within property, plant and equipment.
 
Environmental:
 Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when
they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a
plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
 
Income taxes:
 The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income
taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and
liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had valuation allowances of $
31
 million and $22 million on its deferred tax assets,
respectively. 
The increase in valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 relates to current acquisitions in certain international jurisdictions.
The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
.
 
Earnings per share:
 The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share
attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain
options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would not have had a dilutive effect (5.0
million average options for 2015, 1.4

million average options for 2014, and 2.0 million average options for 2013). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for
the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include
stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under
applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related
expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.
 
Comprehensive income:
 Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international
companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity
securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
 
Derivatives and hedging activities:
 All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and
option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled
are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in
current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows
from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
 
Credit risk:
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The
Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major
international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when
possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts
owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and
60
 
Table of Contents
 
liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting
arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
 
Fair value measurements:
 3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the
measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs
are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent
of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in
valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into
three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Acquisitions: 
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
.  
This standard requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of
consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related
restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-08, 
Reporting Discontinued Operations and
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity
, which changed the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as
discontinued operations and modified related disclosure requirements. This standard has the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals
reported as discontinued operations, by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an
entity’s operations and financial results. However, existing provisions that prohibited an entity from reporting a discontinued operation if it
had certain continuing cash flows or involvement with the component after disposal were eliminated by this standard. The ASU also
expands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not
qualify as discontinued operations. For 3M, this ASU was effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2015. This ASU was applied to the
2015 divestiture information discussed in Note 2 and had no material impact on consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14,
which amended ASU No. 2014-09 as to effective date. The ASU, as amended, provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-
specific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the contract with a
customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the
performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard also specifies the
accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. The
standard provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified retrospective adoption by which it is applied only to the most current
period presented. For 3M, the ASU, as
61
 
Table of Contents
 
amended, is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing this standard’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, 
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
, which changes guidance related to both
the variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard
changes, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the
VIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the
ASU eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise
be overcome. Under the new guidance, a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model.
For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. 3M does not have significant involvement with entities
subject to consolidation considerations impacted by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships potentially impacted by the VOE
model changes. As a result, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.
   
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, 
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
, and in August 2015 issued ASU
No. 2015-15, 
Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements
. Under ASU
2015-03, debt issuance costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt
liability rather than as an asset. While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding
costs to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU No. 2015-15 provides
commentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an
asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. For 3M, ASU No. 2015-03 is effective
January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application
to prior periods. As a result, debt issue costs aggregating $26 million previously included within Other Assets have been reflected as
reductions in the balances of Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2014.
 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, 
Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement
, which requires a
customer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license,
the customer would account for fees related to the software license element in a manner consistent with accounting for the acquisition of
other acquired software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as
a service contract. An arrangement would contain a software license element if both (1) the customer has the contractual right to take
possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either
run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. For 3M, this ASU is
effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The standard provides for adoption either fully retrospectively or prospectively to
arrangements entered into, or materially modified, after the effective date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact
on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, 
Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
(or Its Equivalent)
. This standard modifies existing disclosure requirements such that investments for which the practical expedient is used
to measure their fair value at net asset value (NAV) would be removed from the fair value hierarchy disclosures. Instead, an entity would be
required to include those investments as a reconciling item such that the total fair value amount of investments in the fair value hierarchy
disclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet. Changes were also made to the requirements in a sponsor’s employee benefit
plan asset disclosures. For 3M, this standard is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in
the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans,
reflects the modified disclosures with respect to applicable plan assets. As this ASU only relates to certain disclosures, it did not impact the
Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, 
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
, which modifies existing requirements
regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of
replacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit
62
 
Table of Contents
 
margin. The new ASU replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV
less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. For 3M, this standard is effective prospectively beginning January 1,
2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.
   
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, 
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments
, that eliminates
the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under existing
standards, an acquirer in a business combination reports provisional amounts with respect to acquired assets and liabilities when their
measurements are incomplete as of the end of the reporting period. Prior to the impact of this ASU, an acquirer is required to adjust
provisional amounts (and the related impact on earnings) by restating prior period financial statements during the measurement period
which cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period
adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified—eliminating
the requirement to restate prior period financial statements. The new standard requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement-
period adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in current-period earnings that would have
been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The
ASU is applied prospectively to measurement-period adjustments that occur after the effective date. For 3M, this standard is required
prospectively beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard with respect to measurement-
period adjustments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additional disclosure, as applicable, is included in Note 2, Acquisitions and
Divestitures.
 
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, 
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
, which requires entities to present
deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), along with any related valuation allowance, as noncurrent in a balance sheet.
This ASU eliminates current guidance requiring deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and a
net noncurrent asset or liability. As a result, each jurisdiction would have one net noncurrent DTA or DTL balance. The ASU does not
change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting DTAs and DTLs within a particular jurisdiction. For 3M, this standard is
effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. In light of the process simplification provided by this ASU, the Company adopted
this standard
 in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, the December 31, 2014 balances of
DTAs and DTLs previously reported were impacted as follows:

In conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, 3M reclassified $169 million of remaining other current tax assets to prepaid expenses and
other to conform to the 2015 presen
t
ation.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
, which
revises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain
fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the
fair value of financial instruments. The new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other
ownership interests in an entity, including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies
(collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to
measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding
gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available for sale in other comprehensive income (OCI). They
also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be
permitted to elect a practicability exception and
63
 
Table of Contents
 
measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly transactions). The ASU also establishes
an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the
fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion of the
total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. For derivative
liabilities for which the FVO has been elected, however, any changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk would
continue to be presented in net income, which is consistent with current guidance. For 3M, this standard is effective beginning January 1,
2018 via a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity securities without readily
determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.
 
 
NOTE 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
Acquisitions:
 
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors,
growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies.
 
The impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2015 acquisitions and assigned weighted-average
intangible asset lives, including adjustments relative to other acquisitions within the measurement period, follows.
 
The allocation of purchase
consideration related to the August 2015 Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media acquisitions is considered preliminary, primarily
with respect to certain tax-related assets and liabilities. 3M expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one year
measurement-period following these acquisitions. Adjustments to preliminary allocations primarily related to the identification and
valuation of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets (further discussed below). The change to provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial
impact to results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015, a portion of which relates to earlier quarters in the measurement period.

3M completed one acquisition (Treo Solutions, LLC) during 2014, the impact of which on the consolidated balance sheet was not
considered material. 
Separately, as discussed in Note 6, during 2014, 3M (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) purchased Sumitomo Electric
Industries, Ltd.’s 
25
 percent interest in 3M’s consolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 
90
 billion Japanese Yen. Because 3M
already had a controlling interest in this consolidated subsidiary, this transaction was separately recorded as a financing activity in the
statement of cash flows.
 
There were 
no
 acquisitions that closed during 2013.
 
Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies
expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses. Pro forma information related to acquisitions was not included because the
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not considered to be material.
 
In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain
enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset
purchase and investment activity.
 
2015 acquisitions:
 
In March 2015, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding shares of Ivera Medical Corp., headquartered in San Diego,
California. Ivera Medical Corp. is a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices used for access into a patient’s
bloodstream. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) purchased the remaining interest in a former equity method
investment for an immaterial amount.
 
In August 2015, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) acquired all of the outstanding shares of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L., with operating
headquarters in Bloomington, Minnesota, from KKR & Co. L.P. for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The net assets acquired included the
assumption of $0.8 billion of debt. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment.
 
In August 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) acquired the assets and liabilities associated with Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media
business, headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, for $1.0 billion. Polypore’s Separations Media business is a leading provider of
microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments.
 
Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2015 totaled $1.0 billion. The associated finite-lived
intangible assets acquired in 2015 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life
of 
14
 years (lives ranging from 
two
 to 
20
 years). Indefinite-lived intangible assets of $520 million relate to certain tradenames associated
with the Capital Safety acquisition which have been in existence for over 55 years, have a history of leading market-share positions, have
been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an
indefinite period of time. Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed
renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.
 
2014 acquisitions:
 
During 2014, 3M completed 
one
 business combination. The purchase price paid for this business combination (net of cash acquired) and the
impact of other matters (net) during 2014 aggregated to 
$94
 million.
 
In April 2014, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of Treo Solutions LLC, headquartered in Troy,
New York. Treo Solutions LLC is a provider of data analytics and business intelligence to healthcare payers and providers.
 
65
 
Table of Contents
 
Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2014 totaled 
$34
 million. The associated finite-lived
intangible assets acquired in 2014 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life
of 
six
 years (lives ranging from 
three
 to 
10
 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for
which significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not
material.
 
Divestitures:
 
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors
relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling
the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders.
 
In January 2015, 3M (Electronics and Energy Business) completed the sale of its global Static Control business to Desco Industries Inc.,
based in Chino, California. 2014 sales of this business were

As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care
Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.
 For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit
changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During
the 
third
 quarter of 
2015
, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this
new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth
quarter of 
2015
 for all reporting units and determined that 
no
 impairment existed. In addition, the Company had 
no
 impairments of goodwill
in prior years.
 
Acquired Intangible Assets
 
For 
2015
, the 
intangible assets (excluding goodwill) acquired through business combinations increased the gross carrying amount. Balances

NOTE 4.  Restructuring Actions
 
2015 Restructuring Actions:
 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on
structural overhead, largely in the U.S. and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)
and Latin America. This impacted approximately 
1,700
 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114
million.

Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Shares
 
On September 1, 2014, 3M (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) purchased Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.’s 
25
 percent interest in 3M’s
consolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 
90
 billion Japanese Yen. Upon completion of the transaction, 3M owned 
100
 percent of
Sumitomo 3M Limited. This transaction was recorded as a financing activity (Purchase of noncontrolling interest) in the statement of cash
flows.
 
In April 2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was
classified as a financing activity (Purchase of noncontrolling interest) in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
The following table summarizes the effects of these 2014 transactions on equity attributable to 3M Company shareholders:

In March 2013, 3M sold shares in 3M India Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in return for 
$8
 million. The noncontrolling interest
shares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in India. This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities
regulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 
25
 percent. As a
result of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 
76
 percent to 
75
 percent. The 
$8
 million received in the
first quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Because the Company retained its
controlling interest, the

sale resulted in an increase in 3M Company shareholder’s equity of 
$7
 million and an increase in noncontrolling interest of 
$1
 million.

as well as net interest payments/receipts associated with interest rate swap contracts.
 
Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate
impacts, which are presented separately.
 
Transactions related to investing and financing activities with significant non-cash components are as follows:
 
·
During the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M sold and leased-back, under a capital lease, certain recently constructed machinery and
equipment in return for a municipal bond with the City of Nevada, Missouri valued at approximately 
$15
 million as of the
transaction date.
 
·
During the third quarter of 2013, 3M sold its equity interest in a non-strategic investment in exchange for a note receivable of
approximately 
$24
 million, which is considered non-cash investing activity. As a result of this transaction, in the third quarter of
2013, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of 
$18
 million in its Health Care business segment. In October 2013, cash was received for the
note receivable and is reflected in other investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the 
year ended 
December
31, 
2013.
 
·
During the second quarter of 2013, the Company’s Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary moved its administrative headquarters to a
new leased location and sold the former site under an installment sale arrangement. As a result, at the time of the closing of the
sale transaction, the Company received certain cash proceeds (included in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in
the consolidated statement of cash flows) and recorded a note receivable (due in quarterly installments through the first quarter of
2016) of 
$78
 million and deferred profit of 
$49
 million (both based on the foreign currency exchange rate at the time of closing).
Remaining quarterly installments are due through the first quarter of 2016 and will be included in other investing activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows. Deferred profit is reduced and recognized into income in connection with such quarterly
installments.
 
In addition, as discussed in Note 6, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2015 dividend of 
$1.025
per share (pa
id
 in March 2015), which reduced 3M’s stockholders equity and increased other current liabilities as of December 2014 by
$648
 million. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2014 dividend of 
$0.855
 per share (paid in
March 2014). This reduced 3M’s stockholders equity and increased other current liabilities as of December 31, 2013 by 
$567
 million.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal
(approximately 
$31
 million), state (approximately 
$2
 million), and international (approximately 
$76
 million), with all amounts before
valuation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 
15
 to 
20
 years, the state after 
five
 to 
10
 years, and the majority of
international after 
four
 years with the remaining international expiring in 
one
 year or with an indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes
being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of
taxable income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has provided 
$31
 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred
tax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be
realized.

The 
effective tax rate for 2015 was 
29.1
 percent, compared to 
28.9
 percent in 2014, an increase of 
0.2
 percentage points, impacted by several
factors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included international taxes, which were impacted by changes in foreign
currency rates and changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes, and other items. Combined, these factors increased the
Company’s effective tax rate by 
2.4
 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 
2.2
 percentage point decrease, which related to
the remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions, including the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation
deductions were previously limited, and increases in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction and U.S. research and development credit
benefits.
 
T
he effective tax rate for 2014 was 
28.9
 percent, compared to 
28.1
 percent in 2013, an increase of 
0.8
 percentage points, impacted by many
factors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included a one-time international tax impact related to the establishment
of the supply chain center of expertise in Europe, decreased U.S. research and development credit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to 
two
years inclusion as a result of the reinstatement in 2013, decreased domestic manufacturer’s deduction, and other items. Combined, these
factors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 
1.6 
percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 
0.8
 percentage point
decrease, which related to both lower 3M income tax reserves for 2014 when compared to 2013 and international taxes as a result of changes
to the geographic mix of income before taxes.
 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.
 
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2013. The
Company protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the IRS. In
December 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the
first quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year. Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax
returns for the years 2014 and 2015. It is anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2014 by the end of the
first quarter of 2016 and for 2015 by the end of the first quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2015, the IRS has not proposed any significant
adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.
 
Payments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2015 examinations may not be made until a final agreement
is reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals
process or judicial action. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign
jurisdictions.
 
3M anticipates changes to the Company’s uncertain tax positions due to the closing and resolution of audit issues for various audit years
mentioned above and closure of statutes. The Company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease during the next 12 months as a result of the ongoing income tax authority examinations.

The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by 
$369
 million as of December 31, 2015, 
$265
 million as of
December 31, 2014, and 
$262
 million as of December 31, 2013. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such
as Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other
Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the
consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately 
$2
 million of expense, 
$14
 million of benefit, and 
$22
 million of expense
in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or
remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, accrued interest and penalties in the
consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were 
$45
 million and 
$44
 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts
are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about
the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the
shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to
an earlier period.
 
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the
following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Taiwan (2015),
China (2016), Korea (2018), Brazil (2023), Switzerland (2024), and Singapore (2025). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status
of these subsidiaries are estimated to be 
$114
 million (
18
 cents per diluted share) in 2015, 
$99
 million (
15
 cents per diluted share) in 2014,
and 
$87
 million (
13
 cents per diluted share) in 2013.
 
The Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to
be reinvested indefinitely, with the exception of an acquired entity. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately 
$1
2
billion as of December 31, 2015. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the
earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax
liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely
.

Classification of marketable securities
 as current or non-current is based on the nature of the securities and availability for use in current
operations
.
 
At December 31, 2015 
and
 2014, gross unrealized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were 
not 
material. Refer to Note 6 for a table that
provides the net realized gains (losses) related to sales or impairments of debt and equity securities, which includes marketable securities.
The gross amounts of the realized gains or losses were not material. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Since
these marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other comprehensive
income, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment.
 
3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC
320
, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities
, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-
temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of
shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income attributable to 3M for the applicable accounting period because the
loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the
projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.

The balance at December 31, 2015, for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from
contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

3M has a diversified marketable securities portfolio of 
$12
7
 
million as of December 31, 2015. Within this portfolio, current asset-backed
securities (estimated fair value of 
$57
 million) primarily include interests in automobile loans, credit cards and equipment leases. 3M’s
investment policy allows investments in asset-backed securities with minimum credit ratings of Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA
by Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must be rated by at least 
two
 of the aforementioned rating
agencies, 
one
 of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At December 31, 2015, all asset-backed security
investments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 
75.8
 percent of all asset-backed security investments were rated AAA or A-
1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or AAA or F1+ by Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit
risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general
conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed
securities. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holding in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or
liquidity.

Credit Facilities
 
In August 2014, 3M amended and extended its existing 
$1.5
 billion 
five
-year revolving credit facility to a 
$2.25
 billion five-year agreement
expiring in August 2019. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to 
$2.25
 billion,
bringing the total facility up to 
$4.5
 billion (at the lender’s discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. Under the 
$2.25
billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less
than 
3.0
 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the 
four
 consecutive quarters
then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 
56
 to 1. Debt
covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
 
Other Credit Facilities
 
Apart from the committed revolving facility, a
n additional 
$241
 million in stand-alone letters of credit and 
$18
 million in bank guarantees
were also issued and outstanding at 
December 31, 2015
. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
 
Long-Term Debt Issuances
 
The principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table
found at the beginning of this note.
 
In May 2015, 3M issued 
1.750
 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium term notes. 
In August 2015, 3M issued 
$1.500
 billion
aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. 
Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into 
two
 interest rate swaps as fair value
hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a 
$450
 million 
three
-year fixed rate note, and
the second converted 
$300
 million of a 
five
-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index.
 
In June 2014, 3M issued $
950
 million aggregate
 principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap to convert $600 million of a 
$625
 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.
 In November 2014, the Company
issued 
1.250
 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.
 
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond for an amount of 
600
 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap on a notional amount of 
300
 million Euros.

Long-Term Debt Maturities
 
In July 2014, 3M retired at maturity 
1.025

three
-year 
66
 million British Pound (approximately 
$106
 million based on agreement date exchange rates) committed credit facility
agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2012. 3M repaid the balance in 2014.
 
In August 2013, 3M repaid 
$850
 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.
 
Floating Rate Notes
 
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at
various prices ranging from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004,
3M issued a 
forty
-year 
$60
 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note
due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 
100
 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity.
Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence 
ten
 years from the date of
issuance and each 
third
 anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value. In 2008
through 2015, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.
 
 
NOTE 11.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
 
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In
total, 3M has over 
80
 defined benefit plans in 
28
 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each
participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed
to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for
substantially all of its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company. Most international employees and
retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international
employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.
 
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to
substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
6%
of eligible compensation were matched in cash at rates of 
60%
 or 
75%
, depending on the plan in which the employee participates.
Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, received a cash match of 
100%
 for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
6%
 of eligible
compensation and also received an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 
3%
 of the participant’s total eligible
compensation. Beginning on January 1, 2016, for U.S. employees, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions. For
eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
5%
 of eligible compensation will be matched in
cash at rates of 
45%
 or 
60%
, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, will
receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and will also continue to receive an
employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested
in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were
$165
 million, 
$153
 million and 
$136
 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also
participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were 
$77
 million, 
$75
million and 
$71
 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
 
The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies
are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due
to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to
annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.

Table of Contents
 
3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has a significant credit
balance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act funding requirements.
 
As a result of changes made to its U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans in 2010, the Company has transitioned all current and future
retirees to a savings account benefits-based plan. These changes became effective beginning January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible
retirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and
their eligible dependents.
 
In August 2015, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the
future benefit for participants not retired as of January 1, 2016. 
For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, t
he Retiree Medical Savings
Account (RMSA) 
is 
no longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement
Arrangement 
is
 reduced from 
3
 percent to 
1.5
 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). Also effective
January 1, 2016, 3M no longer offer
s
 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires. Due to these changes the plan was re-measured in the
third quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease to the projected benefit obligation liability of approximately 
$233
 million, and a related
increase to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
In the third quarter of 2014, former U.S. employees who have a pension benefit for which they have not begun receiving payment (term
vested) were offered a lump sum payout of their pension benefit. As a result of this action, the projected benefit obligation (PBO) liability
was reduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 by approximately 
$270
 million, with the actual cash payout of approximately the same amount
paid from the plan’s assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. The PBO liability reduction was 
34%
 of the term vested eligible PBO and a 
2%
reduction in the overall U.S. pension PBO liability based on the December 31, 2013, valuation. There was 
no
 pension expense impact as a
result of this action on 3M’s consolidated statement of income in 2014.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors approved an amendment of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan to include a lump
sum payment option for employees that have vested retirement benefits who commence their pension January 1, 2015, or later. This option
is also available to vested employees who leave 3M before becoming eligible to retire at the time of termination. This change reduced 3M’s
year-end 2014 U.S
.
 
pension 
PBO liability by approximately 
$266
 million.
 
As of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scale it used
for calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of
this change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension PBO by approximately 
$820
 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately 
$100
 million.
 
In March 2015, 3M Japan modified the Japan Limited Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan (DBCPP). Beginning July 1, 2015, eligible
employees receive a company provided contribution match of 
6.12%
 of their eligible salary to their defined contribution plan. Employees no
longer earn additional service towards their defined benefit pension plans after July 1, 2015, except for eligible salaries above the statutory
defined contribution limits. As a result of this plan modification, the Company re-measured the DBCPP, which resulted in a 
$17
 million
pre-tax curtailment gain for the year ending December 31, 2015. 
I
n March
 
2015, 3M
 also
 received a favorable Internal Revenue Service tax
determination letter
 
to terminate a frozen defined benefit pension plan of one of 3M’s acquired subsidiaries. By the end of 2015, th
is
 
p
lan
made final 
distribut
ions of
 
$16
 million to participants.
 
The Company also had other settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits
and other items in 2015 aggregating to the amounts indicated in these components in the applicable tables that follow.
 
3M was informed during the first quarter of 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold
limited partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC (Commodity
Futures Trading Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and 
six
 other limited partners of WG Trading Company, the
district court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan (and in April 2013, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). 
The benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests
were adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement
dates.

The Company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently known, will result in the probable recovery of a portion of the
decrease in original asset value. In the first quarter of 2014, 3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota against 
five
 insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In September 2015, the court
ruled in favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and
the 3M benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
 As of the 2015 measurement date,
these holdings represented less than 
one half of one percent 
of 3M’s fair value of total plan assets. 3M currently believes that the resolution
of these events will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets
as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective
years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess
benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and
which are not included in the tables that follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than 
$35
 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014

The balance of amounts recognized for international plans in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31 in the preceding
table are presented based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date.
 
The pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation
as of the measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation of the
U.S. pension plans was 
$14.834
 billion and 
$15.335
 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The accumulated benefit
obligation of the international pension plans was 
$5.773
 billion and 
$6.401
 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
The following amounts relate to pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31:

The Company is in the process of transitioning all current and future retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings
account benefits-based plan. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for
employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore,
the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.
 
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and
postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the
current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the
yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle
projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 
4.47%
 for pension and 
4.48%
 for
postretirement benefits to be appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2015, which is an increase of 
0.37
 percentage points and 
0.41
percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2014. For the international pension and postretirement plans the
discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country
has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that
generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep
market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields.
 Beginning in 2016,
3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement
benefit costs. The new method measures service and interest costs separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each
corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The
interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield
curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the
actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise
measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve
rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.
 
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 
7.75%
 in 2015. Projected
returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and
investment management. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s 2016 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 
7.50%
, a
decrease of 
0.25
 percentage points from 2015. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long
term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The 2015 expected long-term rate
of return
86
 
Table of Contents
 
is based on an asset allocation assumption 
of 
25%
 global equities, 
18%
 private equities, 
41%
 fixed-income securities, and 
16%
 absolute
return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management.
The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2015 was 
0.7%
. In 2014 the plan earned a rate of return of 
13.0%
 and in 2013 earned a return
of 
6.0%
. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 
7.8%
 and 
10.0%
, respectively. Return on
assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset
allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
 
During 2015, the Company contributed 
$264
 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and 
$3
 million to its postretirement plans.
During 2014, the Company contributed 
$210 
million to its U.S. and international pension plans and 
$5
 million to its postretirement plans. In
2016, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of 
$100
 million to 
$200
 million of cash to its U.S. and international
retirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. Future
contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.

Plan Asset Management
 
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the
trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its
primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present
and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the
potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments
to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.
 
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds.
However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate
amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
 
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 13 for
descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
 
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include
a target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and
illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long
periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for
tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable
ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans.  Approximately 
39%
 of the postretirement benefit plan
assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same
investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.
 
The fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:

International Pension Plans Assets
 
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories
is presented in aggregate for over 
70
 defined benefit plans in 
27
 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy
from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and
investment allocation process in each country. The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans
with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
 
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.
 
The fair values of the assets held by the international pension plans by asset class are as follows:

NOTE 12.  Derivatives
 
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally
associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various
types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted
for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s financial position and performance.
 
Additional information with respect to the impacts on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is
included in Note 6. Additional information with respect to the fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 13. References to
information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also made in Note 10.
 
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income
:
 
Cash Flow Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same
91
 
Table of Contents
 
period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
 
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts:
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option
contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are
designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other
comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow
hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument
previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until
the forecasted transaction occurs. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are
included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014
,
 3M began
extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions
from a previous term of 
12
 months to a longer term of 
24
 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 
36
 months starting in the
first quarter of 2015
.
 
Cash Flow Hedging - Commodity Price Management:
 The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M discontinued the use of commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted
commodity transactions in the first quarter of 2015. The Company used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted
commodity transactions to manage price volatility. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other
comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected
earnings
.
 
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts:
 
In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest
rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 
500
 million Euros as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with the forecasted issuance
of fixed rate debt. 
3M terminated these interest rate swaps
 
upon issuance 
of 
750
 million Euros aggregate principal amount of 
twelve
-year
fixed rate notes
 in connection with 3M’s 1.250 billion Eurobond offering in November 2014. T
he termination resulted in a 
$8
 million pre-
tax (
$5
 million after-tax) loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the 
twelve
-year life of the notes.
 
The amortization of 
gains and 
losses 
on forward starting interest rate swaps
 is included in the tables below as part of the 
gain/(loss)
recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of 
$124
 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash
flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of 
$5
 million (after tax
loss) related to forward starting interest rate
 swaps
, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates
as of December 31, 2015, 3M expects to reclassify approximately 
$98
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow
hedging gains to earnings in 2016, approximately 
$23
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to
earnings in 2017, and approximately 
$3
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings after
2017 (with the impact offset by 
earnings/losses
 from underlying hedged items).
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other
comprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the
forecasted transaction.

Fair Value Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
 
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps:
 The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help
manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at
specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal
amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of
the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no
impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
 
In July 2007, in connection with the issuance of a 
seven
-year Eurobond for an amount of 
750
 million Euros, the Company completed a
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 
400
 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate
Eurobond obligation. In August 2010, the Company terminated 
150
 million Euros of the notional amount of this swap. As a result, a gain of
18
 million Euros, recorded as part of the balance of the underlying debt, was amortized as an offset to interest expense over this debt’s
remaining life. Prior to termination of the applicable portion of the interest rate swap, the mark-to-market of the hedge instrument was
recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and was offset by the gain or loss on carrying value of the underlying debt instrument.
Consequently, the subsequent amortization of the 18 million Euros recorded as part of the underlying debt balance was not part of gains on
hedged items recognized in income in the tables below. The remaining interest rate swap of 
250
 million Euros (notional amount) matured in
July 2014.
 
93
 
Table of Contents
 
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond 
due in 2021 
for a face amount of 
600
 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-
to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 
300
 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond
obligation.
 
In June 2014, 3M issued 
$950
 million aggreg
ate
 principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap to convert 
$600
 million of 
a $625 mill
i
on note included in this issuance
 to an interest rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.
 
In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. 
Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into
two interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation
. T
he first converted 
a
 $450
million three-year fixed rate note, and the second converted $300 million of 
a
 five-year fixed rate note 
included in this issuance 
to an
interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index
.

Net Investment Hedges:
 
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments
to hedge portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are
designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or
losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The
remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in
cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged
foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment hedge
relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings
through their maturity date.
 
3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by
time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or
are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange
risk coverage.
 
At December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was
approximately 
974
 million Euros and approximately 
248
 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal
94
 
Table of Contents
 
amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 
3.6
 billion Euros. The maturity dates of these derivative
and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 201
6
 to 2030.
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative and
nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. There were 
no
 reclassifications of the effective portion of net
investment hedges out of accumulated other comprehensive income into income for the periods presented in the table below.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were
designated in cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign
currency forward contracts to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany
licensing arrangements) and enters into commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain
commodities and precious metals. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and
losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments
:
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company
actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks
and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit
risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity
and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2015, 3M has International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 
1
6
 applicable banks and financial institutions which contain netting provisions. In
addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a 
primary
 counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has associated credit support
agreements in place with 
1
5
 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under which
either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified
thresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
 
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis
even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the
following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted
in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the
counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the
reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not
eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash collateral had been received or pledged related to these

Foreign Currency Effects
 
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts,
 increased pre-tax income by
approximately
 
$180
 million and 
$10
 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars
into U.S. dollars.
 
 
NOTE 13.  Fair Value Measurements
 
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard
also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants
would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset
or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other
than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
:
 
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities,
available-for-sale investments (included as part of investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and certain derivative instruments.
Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs and
tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements
with respect to nonfinancial assets or
98
 
Table of Contents
 
liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2015 and 2014.
 
3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets
and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:
 
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for
these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from
large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm
to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding
certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 9.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:
 
In the fourth quarter 2014, 3M obtained a municipal bond with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal
securities holding as of December 31, 2015. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the financial health
of the City of Nevada, any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic considerations related to the direction of
interest rates and the health of the overall municipal bond market, and as such will be classified as a level 3 security.
 
Available-for-sale investments:
 
Investments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and
are used as being representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as level 1.
 
Derivative instruments:
 
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair
value. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price
swaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use
foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820,
as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with
respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
 
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps
and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using
standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary
source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated
through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least
annually). Refer to Note 11.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:
 
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset
impairments. There were no material long-lived asset impairments for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments,
accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (except the 
m
edium-term fixed rate notes totaling 
$1
 billion, which will
mature in September 2016 and are shown separately in the table below) approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities and investments, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair
values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. For its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes to estimate fair values
(classified as level 2). Information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount
of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and
by the designation of fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its
European subsidiaries. Many of 3M’s fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at December 31, 2015 and 2014 due to the low interest
rates and tightening of 3M’s credit spreads.

NOTE 14.  Commitments and Contingencies
 
 
Capital and Operating Leases:
 
Rental expense under operating leases was 
$316
 million in 2015, 
$332
 million in 2014 and 
$330
 million in 2013. It is 3M’s practice to
secure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has 
three
primary capital leases. First, 3M has a capital lease, which became effective in April 2003, that involves a building in the United Kingdom
(with a lease term of 
22
 years). During the second quarter of 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 
33.5
million British Pound (GBP), or approximately 
$50
 million at December 31, 2015, exchange rates. Second, during the fourth quarter of
2009, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 
$50
 million related to an IT investment with an amortization period
of 
seven
 years. Third, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 
$15
 million, which is
discussed in more detail in Note 7.
 
Minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of 
one
 year as of December 31, 2015, were

Unconditional Purchase Obligations:
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-
cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment
(for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2015, at 
$596
 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows:
2016 (
$193
 million), 2017 (
$160
 million), 2018 (
$102
 million), 2019 (
$54
 million), 2020 (
$56
 million) and after 2020 (
$31
 million). Many
of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are
sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The
purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the
Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to
purchase obligations.
 
Warranties/Guarantees:
 
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are
estimated at approximately 
$28
 million at December 31, 2015, and 
$30
 million at December 31, 2014. 3M does not consider this amount to
be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.

Related Party Activity:
 
3M does not have any material related party activity.
 
Legal Proceedings:
 
The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory
proceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and
sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental
proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
 
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings
 
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and
are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about
future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, 
Contingencies
,
and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss
and where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate
of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range
of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant
legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there
is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
 
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law
interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and
records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the
Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those
insured matters where the Company has not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not
estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of
insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.
 
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that
the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable
development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in
the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently believes that
such future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on
experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each
period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the
Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the
Company could change in the future.
 
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities
and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.

 individual claimants, compared to approximately 
2,220
 individual claimants with actions pending
at December 31, 2014.
 
The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s
mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace
exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in
the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal
injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as
well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.
 
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The
Company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past.
Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater
percentage of total claims than in the past. The Company has prevailed in all 
ten
 cases taken to trial, including 
eight
 of the 
nine
 cases 
tried
 to
verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2015), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict
adverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the
court’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict.
 
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in
the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their
medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s
litigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons,
and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it
experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired.
 
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two
other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in
2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly
incurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and
unspecified punitive damages. The case has been inactive since the fourth quarter of 2007, other than a case management conference in
March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At 
the
hearing on the motion, the c
ourt declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. 
No
 liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company
believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of
loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the
fact that the complaint asserts claims against 
two
 other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and
several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables: The Company estimates its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including
the cost to resolve the claims and defense costs, by examining: (i) the Company’s experience in resolving claims, (ii) apparent trends,
(iii) the apparent quality of claims (e.g., whether the claim has been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv) changes in the
nature and mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure
to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured
by the Company), (v) the number of current claims and a projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed
against the Company, (vi) the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and (vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current
and future claims.
104
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to,
significant changes in (i) the number of future claims, (ii) the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) the legal costs of defending these claims
and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv) changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) changes in the
law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (vii) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
 
As a result of the Company’s cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other
malignancies, the Company increased its accruals in 2015 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by 
$50
 million. In 2015, the Company
made payments for 
legal 
fees and settlements of 
$46
 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the
Company had accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of 
$144
 million (excluding Aearo accruals). This accrual represents the low
end in a range of loss. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the
accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted
or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where
the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint
and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its
liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was 
$39
million. The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law
interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and an assessment of the nature of each claim and remaining coverage.
The Company then records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of
recovery of this receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become
insolvent in the future, and (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos
liability insurance coverage.
 
The Company has unresolved coverage with claims-made carriers for respirator mask claims. The Company is also seeking coverage under
the policies of certain insolvent insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of
its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies
 
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”).
Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain
respiratory protection products.
 
As of December 31, 2015, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical
Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants,
including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek
damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other
occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of 
$21
 million for product liabilities and defense costs
related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and
judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner
Lambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each
company sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation
and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement
entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a
105
 
Table of Contents
 
quarterly fee of 
$100,000
, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims
involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or  silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining
how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims
arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these
arrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving
exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could
potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects
to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.
 
In March 2012, Cabot CSC Corporation and Cabot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Aearo in the Superior Court of Suffolk County,
Massachusetts seeking declaratory relief as to the scope of Cabot’s indemnity obligations under the July 11, 1995 agreement, including
whether Cabot has retained liability for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis claims, and seeking damages for breach of contract. In June 2014, the
court granted Aearo’s motion for summary judgment on all claims. Cabot has filed a motion for reconsideration, and Aearo filed a motion
for clarification of the court’s order granting Aearo summary judgment. In October 2014, the court denied Aearo’s motion for clarification.
The court also denied, in part, Cabot’s motion for reconsideration and reaffirmed its ruling that Cabot retained liability for claims involving
exposure to silica in coal mine dust. The court granted Cabot’s motion, in part, ruling that Aearo was not entitled to summary judgment on
Cabot’s claim for equitable allocation, and on whether the 
258
 underlying claims were Cabot’s responsibility. These 
two
 issues remain in the
case for further proceedings. New motions for summary judgment were filed and the court heard oral arguments in October 2015.
 
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to:
(i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant
changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate
outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation
among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage
limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is
inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo’s share of liability
for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for
existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.
 
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating
responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate
of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the
Company has established.
 
Environmental Matters and Litigation
 
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater
discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local
authorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain
circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for
personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in
complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in
light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and
regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its
operations worldwide.
 
Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980 and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other
106
 
Table of Contents
 
companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The
Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the
section entitled “
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” 
that follows
 for information on the amount of the accrual.
 
Environmental Matters
 
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated
compounds (“PFCs”), including perfluorooctanyl compounds such as perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”) and perfluorooctane sulfonate
(“PFOS”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds. The
company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately 
two
 years of the phase-out
announcement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its ongoing life cycle
management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all
persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company has on occasion identified the presence of precursor chemicals in materials received
from suppliers that may ultimately degrade to PFOA, PFOS, or similar compounds. Upon such identification, the Company works to find
alternatives for such materials.
 
Regulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international
bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As
the database of studies of both chemicals has expanded, the EPA has developed draft human health effects documents summarizing the
available data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for
PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. The EPA has stated that following the peer review process it will revise its
health effects documents and use them to establish lifetime health advisories for PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. Lifetime health
advisories, while not enforceable, serve as guidance and are benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in tap water from
public utilities are safe for public consumption. Once finalized, the EPA stated that the lifetime health advisories are expected to supersede
the provisional health advisories for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water issued by the EPA in 2009 — currently at 
0.4
 micrograms per liter
for PFOA and 
0.2
 micrograms per liter for PFOS. In an effort to collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA
published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including 
six
 PFCs, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by
public water system supplies to determine the extent of their occurrence. 
The 
EPA is reporting results from this exercise on a rolling basis
that will continue in 2016. Through year-end 2015, 
the 
EPA has reported results for 
4,764
 public water supplies nationwide. 
None
 of these
have reported PFOA above the provisional health advisory level issued by 
the 
EPA in 2009, and 
seventeen
 have reported PFOS levels
above the 2009 provisional health advisory.
 
The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFC-
containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois
plants.
 
As previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to
a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately 
twenty
 years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing
PFCs in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFCs in the soil, ADEM agreed that
the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with
subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that option will continue and is expected to be completed in
2018.
 
The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed
May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFCs in the soil and groundwater at former disposal
sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove,
Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFCs from these sites and
proposing response actions; (ii) providing
107
 
Table of Contents
 
treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”)
(i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human
consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFCs  for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites;
(iii) remediating identified sources of other PFCs at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and
(iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting
remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA
issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and summer
of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial
option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the
MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode.
Remediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2016.
 
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing
facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting
of results.
 
The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken
regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
 
Environmental Litigation
 
As previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama
(the “St. John” case), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and
property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The
court in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are
barred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s Workers Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in
November 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity
of the Decatur plant.
 
In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional defendants, including BFI Waste
Management Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur, Alabama; Morgan County,
Alabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities. In September 2015, the court issued
a scheduling order staying discovery pending mediation which occurred in January 2016, but did not resolve the case. Discovery relating to
the class certification will begin, and the class certification hearing is scheduled for November 2016.
 
In 2005, the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit filed by 
three
 residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated
compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds
from the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler” case) granted
the Company’s motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St.
John case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on
behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. No further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is
lifted.
 
In February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the
“Stover” case) seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment
plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other
perfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS,
and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. In March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the case
transferred from Franklin County to Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County
Circuit Court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.

In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (“Water Authority”) filed an individual complaint against 3M
Company, Dyneon, L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  The complaint also
includes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property
who use water provided by the Water Authority and 
five
 local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the
“Water Utilities”).  The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’
chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River
at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the Water Authority.
 
In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General Lori Swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the natural resources of
the State of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages (including unspecified assessment
costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State’s natural resources under the
Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as
statutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFCs in the groundwater,
surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also seeks declarations under MERLA that 3M is
responsible 
for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFCs into the environment,
and under MWPCA that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages.
 
In November 2011, the
 Metropolitan Council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the NRD Lawsuit seeking compensatory
damages and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for costs and fees that the Metropolitan
Council alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the MPCA imposes restrictions on Metropolitan Council’s PFOS
discharges to the Mississippi River, including the installation and maintenance of a water treatment system. The Metropolitan
 Council’s
intervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under MERLA for response
costs, and under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3M for PFOS and other PFC
pollution of the waters and sediments of the Mississippi River. 3M did not object to the motion to intervene. In January 2012, 3M answered
the Metropolitan Council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the Metropolitan Council discharges PFCs to the Mississippi
River and discharges PFC-containing sludge and bio solids from 
one
 or more of its wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and
local area landfills. Accordingly, 3M requested that if the court finds that the State is entitled to any of the damages the State seeks, 3M
seeks contribution and apportionment from the Metropolitan Council, including attorneys’ fees, under MERLA, and contribution from and
liability for the Metropolitan Council’s proportional share of damages awarded to the State under the MWPCA, as well as under statutory
nuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance, and negligence. 3M also seeks declaratory relief under MERA.
 
In April 2012, 3M filed a motion to disqualify the State of Minnesota’s counsel, Covington & Burling, LLP (Covington). In October 2012,
the court granted 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington as counsel to the State and the State and Covington appealed the court’s
disqualification to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s
disqualification order. In October 2013, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted both the State’s and Covington’s petition for review of the
decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In April 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded
the case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court took evidence on the disqualification issues at a hearing in October
2015.
 In February 2016, the district court ruled that Covington violated the professional ethics rule against representing a client (here the
State of Minnesota) in the same or substantially related matter where that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of a
former client (3M). The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it further found that 3M impliedly
waived by delaying to assert the conflict. 3M is reviewing the district court’s opinion to determine next steps.
 Other activity in the case ha
d
been stayed pending the outcome of the disqualification issue. In a separate but related action, the Company filed suit against Covington for
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company and for breach of contract arising out of Covington’s representation of the State of Minnesota
in the NRD Lawsuit.

For environmental litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the Company believes the
amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accrual is not material to the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. For those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the Company
believes any such liability is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.
 
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of 
$43
 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon
an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of 
$11
 million.
The Company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of
environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as
to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the
nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The
Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 
20
years.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of 
$35
 million for “other environmental liabilities” based upon an
evaluation of currently available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA, the remedial action
agreement with ADEM, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale,
Minnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage
Grove, Minnesota, and at 
two
 former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that
most of the spending will occur over the next 
four
 years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries
related to “other environmental liabilities” was 
$15
 million.
 
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative
cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in
the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental
regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies,
including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in
allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-
party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which
remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including
required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to
the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely
ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons
described above.
 
Other Matters
 
Commercial Litigation
 
3M sued TransWeb Corporation in Minnesota in 2010 for infringement of several 3M patents covering fluorination and hydrocharging of
filter media used in 3M’s respirators and furnace filters. TransWeb filed a declaratory judgment action in and successfully moved the
litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of 3M’s patents,
and further alleging that 3M waited too long to enforce its rights. TransWeb also alleged 3M obtained the patents through inequitable
conduct and that 3M’s attempt to enforce the patents constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. In November 2012, a jury returned a
verdict in favor of TransWeb on all but
110
 
Table of Contents
 
one
 count, including findings that 3M’s patents were invalid and not infringed, and that 3M had committed an antitrust violation by seeking
to enforce a patent it had obtained fraudulently. The jury also recommended that the court find 3M had committed inequitable conduct in
obtaining the patents, and that the patents were therefore unenforceable. Since the vast majority of TransWeb’s claim for treble antitrust
damages was in the form of its attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the patent case, the parties agreed that the
measure of damages would not go to the jury, but rather would be submitted to a special master after the trial.
  I
n April, 2014, the court
issued an order denying 3M’s motions to set aside the jury’s verdict. In addition, the court found 
two
 3M patents unenforceable due to
inequitable conduct. The court accepted the special master’s recommendation as to the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded as damages,
and entered judgment against 3M in the amount of approximately 
$26
 million. In July 2014, 3M filed a notice of appeal of the judgment to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its
decision affirming the lower court’s judgment. 3M is reviewing the appellate court’s decision to determine next steps. The impact of the
appellate court’s decision is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
 
Product Liability Litigation
 
Électricité de France (EDF) 
filed
 a lawsuit against 3M France in the French courts in 2006 claiming commercial loss and property damage
after experiencing electrical network failures which EDF claims were caused by allegedly defective 3M transition splices. The French Court
of Appeals at Versailles affirmed the commercial trial court’s decision that the transition splices conformed to contract specifications and
that EDF thoroughly analyzed and tested the splices before purchase and installation. The Court of Appeals, however, ordered a court-
appointed expert to study the problem and issue a technical opinion on the cause of the network failures. The court-appointed expert
submitted his report to the commercial court in May 2014. The expert found potential defects in 3M’s product and found that EDF incurred
damages in excess of 
100
 million Euros. The expert’s opinion is not dispositive of liability or damages and is subject to numerous factual
and legal challenges that will be raised with the court. The parties are briefing the court on their respective positions. Once the briefing is
complete, the commercial court may take from 
six
 months to 
one
 year to render its decision.
 
One
 customer obtained an order in the French courts against 3M Purification SAS (a French subsidiary) in October 2011 appointing an
expert to determine the amount of commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by allegedly defective 3M filters used in the
customer’s manufacturing process. An Austrian subsidiary of this same customer also filed a claim against 3M Austria GmbH (an Austrian
subsidiary) and 3M Purification SAS in the Austrian courts in September 2012 seeking damages for the same issue. 
Those 
two
 cases are still
pending. Another
 customer filed a lawsuit against 3M Deutschland GmbH (a German subsidiary) in the German courts in March 2012
seeking commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by the same 3M filters used in that customer’s manufacturing process; the
Company has resolved the claims in the German litigation. The Company has also settled without litigation the claims of 
two
 other
customers arising out of the same issue. The amounts paid are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company is a named defendant in 
122
 lawsuits, most of which are pending in federal or state court in
Minnesota, in which the plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty
,
 cardiovascular
, and other surgeries
 and later developed
surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
granted the plaintiffs’ motion to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district proceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation.
 
The Bair Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part of the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading
 
manufacturer of patient
warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature in surgical settings. 
No
 liability has been
recorded for this matter because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.
 
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount
recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

NOTE 15. Stock-Based Compensation
 
The 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 
100
 million shares of 3M common stock (including
additional shareholder approvals subsequent to 2008) pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards under this plan may be issued in
the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. Awards denominated in shares of common stock
other than options and stock appreciation rights, per the 2008 Plan, count against the 100 million share limit as 
3.38
 shares for every one
share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates prior to May 11, 2010), as 
2.87
 shares for every one share covered by
such award (for full value awards with grant dates on or after May 11, 2010, and prior to May 8, 2012), or as 
3.50
 shares for every one share
covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of May 8, 2012 or later). The remaining total shares available for grant under
the 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan Program are 
20,328,681
 as of December 31, 2015. There were approximately 
9,20
0
 participants with
outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units at December 31, 2015.
 
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the
performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees
uses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period
approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at
age 
55
 and after having completed 
five
 years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 
35
 percent of the 2015 annual stock-
based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter. 3M also
has granted progressive (reload) options. These options are nonqualified stock options that were granted to certain participants under the
1997 or 2002 Management Stock Ownership Program, but for which the reload feature was eliminated in 2005 (on a prospective basis only).
 
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.
The Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the
issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the Company.
 
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following
table. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Stock options vest over a period from 
one
 to 
three
 years with the expiration date at 
10
 years from date of grant. Outstanding options under
grant include grants from previous plans. As of December 31, 2015, there was 
$69
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be
recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average
vesting period of 
21
 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 
66
 months
and the aggregate intrinsic value was 
$1.958
 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining
contractual life was 
52
 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $
1.763
 billion.
 
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 
$465
 million, 
$615
 million and 
$562
 million,
respectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 
$501
 million, 
$842
 million and 
$1.492
 billion,
respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2015,
2014 and 2013 was 
$172
 million, 
$226
 million and 
$208
 million, respectively.
 
The Company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the
Company has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends, and other factors, to satisfy
stock option exercise activity.
 
For annual and progressive (reload) options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and the assumptions that follow. As discussed earlier, the progressive (reload) feature was eliminated in 2005,
resulting in no activity in the below table for 201
4
 and thereafter.

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2015 annual
grant date, the Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most recent
113
 
Table of Contents
 
one year volatility, the median of the term of the expected life rolling volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected life
volatility of 3M stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is based on the weighted average of
historical grants.

As of December 31, 2015, there was 
$84
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted
stock and restricted stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
24
months. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013 was 
$166
 million, 
$145
 million and 
$114
 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions
related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 
$62
 million,
$54
 million and 
$43
 million, respectively.
 
Restricted stock units granted under the 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan generally vest 
three
 years following the grant date assuming
continued employment. Dividend equivalents equal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on
these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although 
no
 dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that
are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date on restricted stock units, except for performance shares
which do not earn dividends. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is 
no
 impact on basic earnings per share calculations.
Weighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
 
Performance Shares
 
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The
2015 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and
earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. 
The
number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the 
three
-year performance period may be anywhere
from 
0%
 to 
200%
 of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Non-
substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over 
one
 or 
three
 years depending on when each
individual became a 3M executive. Performance shares do not accrue dividends during the performance period. Therefore, the grant date
fair value is determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance
period.

General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):
 
As of December 31, 2015, shareholders have approved 
60
 million shares for issuance under the Company’s GESPP. Substantially all
employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 
85%
 of market value at the date of grant. There are no
GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the
last business day of the same month.

NOTE 16
. Business Segments
 
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and
services. 3M manages its operations in 
five
 business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; 
Electronics and Energy; 
and
Consumer. 3M’s five business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative
products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at
cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers.
Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information
shown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are not allocated
to business segments.

Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses,
certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate
restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not
to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a
quarterly and annual basis.

3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income.
Management evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit U.S.
reporting to further incentivize U.S. sales growth. As a result, 3M provides additional (“dual”) credit to those business segments selling
products in the U.S. to an external customer when that segment is not the primary seller of the product. For example, certain respirators are
primarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, the Industrial business segment
also sells this product to certain customers in its U.S. markets. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also
receive credit for the associated net sales it initiated and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to
dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual
credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating
income for the U.S. in total are unchanged
.

Item 9A. 
Controls
 
 and Procedures.
 
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
 
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).
 Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of 
December 31, 2015
, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s
Separation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in purchase business combinations. 
These acquired
business
es
’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the
Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 Companies are allowed to exclude
acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while integrating the
acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
 LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015
.
 
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently
completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
 
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the
efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next
several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over
financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
 
The Company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited subsidiaries/locations and
will continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,
this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the
testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the
above paragraphs, that the implementation of ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial
reporting.

3M 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
 
1.
Purposes.
    
 
The purposes of this plan are to help 3M attract, retain and motivate outstanding employees to increase shareholder value by contributing to
the long-term growth and success of its business; to more closely align the financial interests of these employees with those of 3M’s other
shareholders by linking a significant portion of their compensation to the performance of the Company and its stock price; to encourage
employees to acquire an equity stake in the Company; to help 3M attract and retain well-qualified individuals to serve as nonemployee
members of its Board of Directors; and to promote the alignment of interests of these nonemployee directors with those of 3M’s other
shareholders by providing all or a portion of their compensation for serving as directors in the form of 3M common stock.
 
This plan is intended to replace and succeed the 2005 Management Stock Ownership Program, the 3M Performance Unit Plan, and the 1992
Directors Stock Ownership Program.

Eligibility.

select the executives and other employees of the Company and its Affiliates who may participate in this Plan by receiving Awards made
hereunder.  All nonemployee members of the 3M Board of Directors shall also be eligible to participate in and receive Awards made
hereunder.
 
4.
Shares Available for Awards.
 
Unless otherwise authorized by the Company’s stockholders, the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or delivered
pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan will be 100,000,000.  Of this total, no more than 100,000,000 may be issued or delivered upon
the exercise of Incentive Stock Options.  The necessary shares shall be made available at the discretion of the Board of Directors from
authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company under corporate repurchase programs. 
 
The following rules shall apply for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance
under the Plan:
 
(a)
If an Award is denominated in a fixed number of shares of Common Stock on the Grant Date, the number of shares
covered by such Award (as in the case of an Option or Restricted Stock grant) or to which such Award relates (as in the case of a Stock
Appreciation Right) will be counted on the Grant Date against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the
Plan.  If an Award is not denominated in a fixed number of shares of Common Stock on the Grant Date (but is potentially payable in such
shares or the final number of shares is not determined until the completion of a Performance Period), only the number of shares of Common
Stock actually issued or delivered as a result of such Award, if any, shall be counted against the total number of shares available for issuance
or delivery under the Plan.
 
(b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4(a) above, each Full Value Award will be counted against the total number of
shares available for issuance or delivery under the Plan according to the following table:
 
3
 
 
 
 Number of Shares Counted Against
 Grant Date of
  the Total Shares Available for Each
Full Value Award
Share Covered by the Full Value Award
 
   May 13, 2008 – May 10, 2010
3.38
   May 11, 2010 – May 7, 2012
2.87
   On or after May 8, 2012
3.50
 
 
(c)
When an Award granted under this Plan and denominated in shares of Common Stock (or any portion thereof) expires, is
cancelled, is forfeited or is otherwise terminated without the issuance of such shares, or is settled in cash or consideration other than shares
of Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock previously counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or
delivery under the Plan on account of such Award (or portion thereof) will again be made available for issuance hereunder.  When an award
granted under a Predecessor Plan and denominated in shares of Common Stock (or any portion thereof) expires, is cancelled, is forfeited or
is otherwise terminated without the issuance of such shares, or is settled in cash or consideration other than shares of Common Stock, then
the shares of Common Stock previously counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under such Predecessor
Plan on account of such Award (or portion thereof) will be added to the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under this
Plan.  Notwithstanding the rest of this Section 4(c), the following shares of Common Stock will not be added to the total number of shares
available or be made available again for issuance under this Plan: (i) shares not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an
outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right; (ii) shares delivered to or withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of or the
withholding taxes with respect to an award; and (iii) shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds from the payment of the
exercise price of an option.
 
(d)
Any shares of Common Stock related to Awards granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding
awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or an Affiliate or with which the Company or any Affiliate combines,
shall not be counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the Plan.
 
5.
Terms of Awards.
 
The Committee shall determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to each Participant, which shall be evidenced by such written or
electronic documents as the Committee shall authorize; provided, however, that nonemployee members of the 3M Board of Directors shall
not be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, Progressive Stock Options, Performance Units or Performance Shares.  The following
types of Awards may be granted under this Plan:
 
(a)
Incentive Stock Options – Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall have an exercise price equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.  Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall
become exercisable at such time as shall be established by the Committee and reflected in the documents evidencing such Options, and
unless sooner terminated shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.   
 
(b)
Nonqualified Stock Options – Nonqualified Stock Options granted hereunder shall have an exercise price equal to no less
than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.  Nonqualified Stock Options
granted hereunder shall become exercisable and shall expire at such time or times as shall be established by the Committee and reflected in
the documents evidencing such Options; provided, however, that no Nonqualified Stock Option shall expire later than ten years after the
Grant Date (except that the Committee may extend the exercise period for Nonqualified Stock Options granted to Participants in any
country or countries for an additional period of up to one year if and to the extent necessary to prevent adverse tax consequences to such
Participants under the laws of such country).
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the vested and exercisable portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right that remains outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of its full term on or after April 1, 2016 (or, if applicable, the expiration
of the limited post-termination exercise window occurring on or after April 1, 2016) shall be deemed to have been exercised by the
Participant at such time if (i) the Participant has accepted the
4
 
 
 
Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (ii) the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock exceeds the applicable exercise price per
share, and (iii) either (A) such Option or Stock Appreciation Right remains outstanding on the last day of its full term or (B) the
Participant’s Option or Stock Appreciation Right otherwise would terminate prior to the last day of its full term as a result of the
Participant’s death.  For the avoidance of doubt, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that terminates upon the expiration of its limited
post-termination exercise window shall not be deemed to have remained outstanding on the last day of its full term for purposes of clause
(iii) in the preceding sentence.  In the event an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised pursuant to this Section, the Company shall
deliver to the Participant the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option or Stock Appreciation Right was deemed exercised,
less the number of shares of Common Stock withheld for the payment of the total purchase price and withholding taxes.
 
(c)
Progressive Stock Options -
 
Whenever
 
a Participant exercises a nonqualified stock option granted under the 1997 or
2002 Management Stock Ownership Program and makes payment of all or part of the purchase price and withholding taxes, if any, in
Common Stock, the Committee may in its discretion grant such Participant a Progressive Stock Option.  The number of shares subject to
such Progressive Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock utilized by the Participant to effect payment of the
exercise price and withholding taxes, if any, for such nonqualified stock option.  Each Progressive Stock Option granted hereunder shall
have an exercise price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of
the nonqualified stock option, which shall be the Grant Date of such Progressive Stock Option.  Each Progressive Stock Option granted
hereunder shall be exercisable six months after the Grant Date, and shall expire at the same time the nonqualified stock option exercised by
the Participant would have expired. 
 
(d)
Stock Appreciation Rights - The term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Committee and set forth in
the documents evidencing such right, but no Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable more than ten years after the Grant Date.  Each
Stock Appreciation Right shall become exercisable at the time or times determined by the Committee and set forth in the documents
evidencing such right.  Each Stock Appreciation Right granted hereunder shall have a grant price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.
 
(e)
Restricted Stock - At the time a grant of Restricted Stock is made, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish
a Restricted Period and such additional terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or complete lapse of
restrictions with respect to all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock.  The Committee may also,
in its sole discretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any terms or conditions for the lapse of restrictions with respect to
all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock.  During the Restricted Period the Participant shall
generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and
receive dividend payments, except that the following restrictions shall apply: (i) none of the Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred,
assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of any other terms and
conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; and (ii) all of the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall
terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company unless the Participant shall have remained a regular full-time employee of
the Company or an Affiliate until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of the other terms and conditions
prescribed by the Committee, if any.  Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may
determine, in its discretion, including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of one or more stock certificates bearing an
appropriate legend recognizing the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.  Upon the forfeiture of any
Restricted Stock, such shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock shall be transferred to the Company without further
action by the Participant.
 
(f)
Restricted Stock Units - At the time a grant of Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee, in its sole discretion,
shall establish a Restricted Period and such additional terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or
complete lapse of restrictions with respect to all or any portion of such Restricted Stock Units.  The Committee may also, in its sole
discretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any terms or conditions for the lapse of restrictions with respect to all or any
portion of the Restricted Stock Units.  During the Restricted Period the Participant will not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as
to such Restricted Stock Units, including the right to vote and receive dividend payments with respect to the shares of Common Stock
corresponding to such Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that at the sole discretion of the Committee, Dividend Equivalents may be
either currently paid in cash or shares or withheld by the Company for the Participant’s account and
5
 
 
 
either maintained in cash to be paid upon the expiration of the Restricted Period or reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units.  Each
grant of Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the following restrictions: (i) the Participant shall not be entitled to the payment of cash or
the delivery of the shares of Common Stock corresponding to such Restricted Stock Units until the expiration or termination of the
Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted
Stock Units may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of at any time; and (iii) except as otherwise
provided in Section 7, all of the Restricted Stock Units and any deferred Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited and all rights of the
Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company upon the termination of the Participant’s employment with
the Company or an Affiliate prior to the end of the Restricted Period; provided, however, that if the Committee so decides and the
documents evidencing an Award of Restricted Stock Units so provide, the preceding exception allowing such Restricted Stock Units to vest
following the Participant’s Retirement shall not apply so that such Restricted Stock Units and any deferred Dividend Equivalents will be
forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company upon the Retirement of such
Participant prior to the end of the Restricted Period.
 
(g)
Other Stock Awards - The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards other than Restricted Stock
grants or Restricted Stock Units, and such Stock Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as
alternatives to grants or rights under this Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, including the plan of
any acquired entity.  If the Committee shall stipulate terms and conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the terms and conditions will
be set forth in the documents evidencing the Award.  If the terms and conditions with respect to any Stock Award shall require the surrender
or forfeiture of other grants or rights under this Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the
Participant shall not have any rights under such Stock Award until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively
surrendered or forfeited.
 
(h)
Performance Units and Performance Shares – At the time it approves each grant of Performance Units or Performance
Shares, the Committee shall determine the number of Performance Units or Performance Shares granted to each Participant, the proration, if
any, of such Performance Units or Performance Shares if the Participant retires prior to the completion of the relevant Performance Period,
the commencement and expiration of the relevant Performance Period, and the Performance Criteria by which the payment value of the
Performance Units or Performance Shares will be determined.  If the Committee provides, a grant of Performance Units or Performance
Shares may provide a Participant with the right to receive Dividend Equivalents, subject to the same restrictions on transferability and
forfeitability and payable at the same time as the Performance Units or Performance Shares with respect to which the Dividend Equivalents
are granted.  Any such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock, by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the written agreement
evidencing the award.  Payment of each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall occur no later than the March 15 of the year
immediately following the completion of the respective Performance Period, unless a Participant shall have made an effective election to
defer the receipt of such payment pursuant to the terms of an applicable deferred compensation plan and all applicable laws.  The amount
payable with respect to each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall be contingent upon the attainment of the Performance Criteria
selected by the Committee during the respective Performance Period, and upon the continued employment of the Participant throughout
such Performance Period (or upon the Participant’s Retirement prior to the end of such Performance Period).
 
6.
Payment of Awards.
 
Payment of Awards may be in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock or combinations thereof as the Committee shall determine, and
with such other restrictions as it may impose.  The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such
terms, rules and conditions as the Committee may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or
Dividend Equivalents; provided, however, that the Committee shall not have any authority to permit or require the deferral of any Award
payment to the extent that the exercise of such authority would cause any excise tax to become due under section 409A of the Code.
 
No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to any Participant upon the exercise of an Option granted under this Plan until full payment of
the exercise price has been made to the Company and the Participant has remitted to the Company the required withholding taxes, if
any.  Payment of the exercise price and withholding taxes, if any, may be made in
6
 
 
 
whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be established from time to time by the
Committee.  If payment is made in shares of Common Stock, such shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the day the
Participant exercises the Option or, as regards a withholding tax, on the date when the tax obligation becomes due.  A Participant need not
surrender shares of already owned Common Stock as payment, and the Company may, upon the giving of satisfactory evidence of
ownership of such shares by the Participant, deliver the appropriate number of additional shares of Common Stock reduced by the number
of shares required to pay the exercise price and any required withholding taxes.  Such form of evidence shall be determined by the
Committee in its discretion.
 
In no event will the Company be required to deliver any fractional share of Common Stock in connection with any Award.  In the event that
a Participant shall be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with an Award granted under the Plan, the
Company shall pay in cash, in lieu thereof, the Fair Market Value of such fractional share.
 
7.
Termination of Awards.
 
If a Participant’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for any reason other than (i) a Disqualifying Termination, (ii)
Retirement, (iii) a termination in connection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of
the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, (iv) a
physical or mental disability as recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Participant’s employer, or (v) death, and prior to the date
of termination the Participant has not fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan, such Participant may
exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right within ninety (90) days following the date of termination (but not beyond the expiration
date of such Option or Right) for the number of shares which the Participant could have purchased or received a payment on the date of
termination.  Unless the documents evidencing such Awards or the terms of this Section 7 provide otherwise, all of the Participant’s Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights shall automatically be forfeited at the conclusion of the ninety (90)-day period following the date of the
Participant’s termination of employment and all of the Participant’s other Awards shall automatically be forfeited at the time of his or her
termination of employment.
 
If a Participant Retires, terminates employment with the Company or an Affiliate and in connection with such termination the Participant
executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the
nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental disability as
recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Participant’s employer, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, the Participant shall be entitled, within the remaining term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (but not beyond the expiration
date of such Option or Right), to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right (provided, however, that in the event of a termination in
connection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with
the approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the additional time to exercise Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights shall apply only to those Options and Stock Appreciation Rights which have vested prior to the date of
termination of employment).  If a Participant who has thus Retired dies, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participant’s death)
may be exercised within two years after the date of his or her death (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the
Participant's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance or
by reason of the death of the Participant.
 
If a Participant, prior to Retirement, dies without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participant’s death) may be exercised within
two years following his or her death (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the Participant's estate or by a person
who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the
Participant.
 
Notwithstanding the rest of this Section 7, if a Participant’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated before he or she has
fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right under circumstances which the Committee believes to warrant special consideration
and the Committee has determined that the Participant's rights should not be forfeited at the time or times specified above, the Option or
Stock Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not
7
 
 
 
already exercisable at the time of termination) may be exercised within two years following his or her termination of employment (but not
beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right).
 
If a Participant’s employment is terminated by the Company or an Affiliate by reason of a restructuring, divestiture, job elimination or any
other similar event, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and in connection with such termination the Participant executes
and does not revoke a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the
Company) for pro rata vesting of the Participant’s annual Restricted Stock Unit Awards in accordance with the terms of this Section 7, then
the Participant shall vest in a portion of his or her then unvested annual Restricted Stock Unit Awards at the time the release becomes
effective and irrevocable.  The number of Restricted Stock Units (if any) subject to the portion of each unvested annual Restricted Stock
Unit Award that vests in accordance with the preceding sentence shall equal the number of additional Restricted Stock Units (if any) in
which the Participant otherwise would have been vested at the time of his or her termination of employment if the Restricted Stock Units
subject to each vesting tranche of such Award vested in a series of successive equal annual installments over the duration of the service-
based vesting schedule otherwise applicable to such vesting tranche.  The Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to
this paragraph shall be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the date on which the Participant’s release becomes
effective and irrevocable (but in any event no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant’s
termination of employment occurs) or, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, in accordance
with the provisions of the documents evidencing the Participant’s Award.
 
If a Participant dies, either prior to or following Retirement, or becomes “disabled” within the meaning of section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the
Code, and has not yet received the stock certificate for the shares of Common Stock represented by a grant of Restricted Stock, Restricted
Stock Units or other Stock Award, then all restrictions imposed during the Restricted Period and any other terms and conditions prescribed
by the Committee, if any, shall automatically lapse and a stock certificate shall be delivered to the Participant or the Participant's
beneficiary, representative, or estate, as the case may be upon the Participant’s demonstration to the satisfaction of the Committee that such
Participant is considered “disabled” for purposes of section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code.
 
If a Participant Retires or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental disability as recognized under a benefit plan
maintained by the Participant’s employer prior to the payment date for an Award of Performance Shares or Performance Units, such
Retirement or change in status shall not affect any rights of the Participant with respect to such Performance Shares or Performance Units;
provided, however, that the Committee may provide for the proration of the Performance Shares or Performance Units granted to a
Participant who Retires prior to the completion of the Performance Period for such Performance Shares or Performance Units.
 
If a Participant dies without having received payment of any Performance Shares or Performance Units granted under this Plan, payment of
such Shares or Units shall be made no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Participant died to such Participant’s
surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries or, if there shall be no such surviving beneficiaries, to such Participant’s estate in the following
manner:
 
(i)  If the Participant dies after the expiration of a Performance Period for such Performance Shares or Performance Units, the
payment shall be at the same rate as that paid to other Participants who survive until the payment date; and
 
(ii)  If the Participant dies before the expiration of a Performance Period for such Performance Shares or Performance Units, the
amount of payment shall be at the lesser of:
 
●
the face or target value of each outstanding Performance Share or Performance Unit for which payment has not
been made; or
 
●
any other amount approved, in its discretion, by the Committee.
 
If a Participant’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated due to a Disqualifying Termination, participation hereunder
shall cease and all of the Participant’s Awards granted under this Plan shall be automatically forfeited, notwithstanding any language to the
contrary in this Plan document.
 
8
 
 
 
If a Participant breaches the provisions of such Participant’s agreement with the Company or an Affiliate pertaining to nondisclosure of
confidential information, assignment of rights to inventions, competition with the Company or post-employment solicitation of the
Company’s employees or customers, and such agreement provides for the forfeiture of Awards granted under this Plan in the event of such
breach, all of the Participant’s Awards granted under this Plan since the date that such Participant signed such agreement shall be
automatically forfeited, notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this Plan document.
 
Participation hereunder shall cease and all rights under the Plan with respect to Restricted Stock or other Stock Awards granted to a
Participant who has been participating in this Plan as a nonemployee member of the 3M Board of Directors are automatically forfeited by
the Participant upon the date of termination of his or her membership on the 3M Board of Directors for any reason other than: (i) retirement,
(ii) physical or mental disability as determined by the Committee, or (iii) death. 
 
8.
Limits on Awards. 
 
No Participant shall be granted Options and Stock Appreciation Rights under this Plan with respect to more than 1,000,000 shares of
Common Stock in any calendar year.  No Participant shall receive cash, vested shares of Common Stock or other property as a result of
Awards granted under this Plan, other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, having a value exceeding $30,000,000 in any calendar
year.  No Participant who is a nonemployee member of 3M’s Board of Directors may be granted Awards under this Plan having a value
(determined as of the Grant Date of each Award) exceeding $500,000 in any calendar year.
 
9.
Plan Administration.
 
This Plan will be administered by the Committee, which shall have full power and authority to select the Participants, interpret the Plan,
continue, accelerate or suspend the exercisability or vesting of an Award, and adopt such rules and procedures for operating the Plan as it
may deem necessary or appropriate.  Its power and authority shall include, but not be limited to, making any amendments to or
modifications of the Plan which may be required or necessary to make such Plan comply with the provisions of any laws or regulations of
any country or unit thereof in which the Company or any Affiliate operates.  To do so, the Committee may establish different terms and
conditions for Awards made to Participants who live in or are subject to taxation in one or more countries other than the United States in
order to accommodate the tax or other relevant laws of such countries.  The Committee may adopt one or more supplements or sub-plans
under the Plan to implement these different terms and conditions.  Except for adjustments made in accordance with Section 11, no Option or
Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan may be repriced to reduce the exercise or grant price of any outstanding Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, nor may an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan be cancelled in exchange for cash,
another Award, or an Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise or grant price that is less than the exercise or grant price of the
cancelled Option or Stock Appreciation Right, without the prior approval of the Company’s stockholders.
 
10.
Delegation of Authority.
 
To the extent permitted by Delaware law, the Committee may delegate to officers of the Company any or all of its duties, power and
authority under this Plan subject to such conditions or limitations as the Committee may establish; provided, however, that no officer shall
have or obtain the authority to grant Awards to (i) himself or herself, (ii) nonemployee members of the 3M Board of Directors, or (iii) any
person subject to section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
11.
Adjustments.
 
In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or
reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger or similar event, the Committee shall adjust proportionately: (a) the number of shares of
Common Stock (i) available for issuance or delivery under this Plan in accordance with Section 4, (ii) for which Awards may be granted to a
single Participant in accordance with Section 8, and (iii) subject to outstanding Awards granted under this Plan; (b) the exercise prices of
outstanding Awards; and (c) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations for such Awards.  In the event of any other
change affecting the Common Stock or any distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of Common Stock, such
9
 
 
 
adjustments in the number or kind of shares and the exercise prices, Fair Market Value and other price determinations of the affected
Awards as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine are equitable, shall be made and shall be effective and binding for all
purposes of such outstanding Awards.  In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or stock, separation,
reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized to cause the Company to assume outstanding employee awards or issue
replacement Awards to affected employees, whether or not in a transaction to which section 424(a) of the Code applies, and to make such
adjustments in the terms of such awards as it shall deem appropriate in order to maintain reasonable comparability or equitable treatment
between the assumed awards and the Awards granted under this Plan as so adjusted. 
 
12.
Withholding.
 
Prior to the payment or settlement of any Award, the Participant must pay, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the
payment of, any and all tax withholding that in the opinion of the Company is required by law.  The Company or any Affiliate shall have the
right to deduct applicable taxes from any Award payment, to withhold from the shares of Common Stock being issued or delivered in
connection with an Award an appropriate number of shares for the payment of taxes required by law, or to take such other action as may be
necessary in the opinion of the Company or such Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the withholding of such taxes.
 
13.
Transferability.
 
Except as permitted in this Section 13, no Award granted under this Plan may be assigned, transferred (other than a transfer by will or the
laws of descent and distribution as provided in Section 7), pledged, or hypothecated (whether by operation of law or otherwise).  Awards
granted under this Plan shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit
individual Participants to transfer the ownership of all or any of their Nonqualified Options granted under this Plan to (i) the spouse, former
spouse, children or grandchildren of such Participant (“Immediate Family Members”), (ii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of such
Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a partnership in which such Immediate Family Members are the only partners, provided that (x) there
may be no consideration for any such transfer, and (y) subsequent transfers of transferred Nonqualified Options shall be prohibited except
those in accordance with Section 7 (by will or the laws of descent and distribution).  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, create
further conditions and requirements for the transfer of Nonqualified Options.  Following transfer, any such Nonqualified Options shall
continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer.  The events causing termination of
Awards in accordance with Section 7 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Participant, following which the
Nonqualified Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified in Section 7.
 
14.
Validity.
 
In the event any provision of this Plan should be determined to be illegal or invalid for any reason, it shall not affect the remaining
provisions of the Plan which shall remain in effect as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.
 
15.
Governing Law.
 
The provisions of this Plan shall be governed by, and interpreted and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
16.
Effective Date, Term, Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
 
This Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders of 3M Company, and shall expire (unless
it is terminated before then) on the tenth anniversary of such effective date.  Such expiration shall not adversely affect Awards granted
under this Plan prior to such expiration date.  The Committee may at any time amend or terminate this Plan, except that no amendment or
termination shall adversely affect Awards granted under this Plan prior to the effective date of such amendment or termination; provided,
however, that no amendment shall be made without the prior approval of the Board of Directors and the holders of a majority of the issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock represented and entitled to vote on such amendment which would (i) increase the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance or delivery under this Plan in accordance with Section 4 (except for
10
 
 
 
adjustments made in accordance with Section 11), (ii) permit the granting of Awards with purchase prices lower than those specified in
Section 5, or (iii) be a material amendment for which stockholder approval is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule.
 
17.

or the Affiliate employing such Participant.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights with a Grant Date
prior to February 9, 2010 shall (i) become immediately exercisable in full for the remainder of their respective terms upon the occurrence of
a Change in Control of the Company, and (ii) remain exercisable in full for a minimum period of six months following the Change in
Control; provided, however, that in no event shall any Option or Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable beyond the original expiration
date.  Similarly, all restrictions regarding the Restricted Period or the satisfaction of other terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee,
if any, with respect to grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other Stock Awards with a Grant Date prior to February 9, 2010,
shall automatically lapse, expire, and terminate and the Participant shall be immediately entitled to receive a stock certificate for the number
of shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Stock Awards upon the occurrence of a Change
in Control.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if a Participant’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate is
terminated without Cause or if the Participant resigns for a Good Reason within eighteen months following a Change in Control of the
Company, then all of such Participant’s outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights with a Grant Date of February 9, 2010 or later
shall become immediately exercisable in full for the remainder of their respective terms and shall remain exercisable in full for a minimum
of six months following the date of such termination or resignation; provided, however, that in no event shall any Option or Stock
Appreciation Right be exercisable beyond the original expiration date.  Similarly, all restrictions regarding the Restricted Period or the
satisfaction of other terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any, with respect to grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock
Units or other Stock Awards with a Grant Date of February 9, 2010 or later, shall automatically lapse, expire and terminate and the
Participant shall be immediately entitled to receive a stock certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Stock Awards upon the termination without Cause of the Participant’s employment with the
Company or an Affiliate or the Participant’s resignation for Good Reason within eighteen months following a Change in Control of the
Company.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall become
immediately exercisable in full and remain exercisable in full for a minimum period of six months
11
 
 
 
following a Change in Control in which the individuals or entities acquiring control of the Company do not assume or otherwise provide for
the continuation of such Options and Rights for at least such six-month period; provided, however, that in no event shall any Option or
Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable beyond the original expiration date.  Similarly, all restrictions regarding the Restricted Period or
the satisfaction of other terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any, with respect to grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted
Stock Units or other Stock Awards shall automatically lapse, expire, and terminate and the Participant shall be immediately entitled to
receive a stock certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Stock
Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control in which the individuals or entities acquiring control of the Company do not assume or
otherwise provide for the continuation of such Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and other Stock Awards.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company each
Performance Period shall end and the Company shall immediately distribute in cash or shares of Common Stock, as appropriate, to the
respective Participants the value of all outstanding Performance Shares and Performance Units granted under this Plan with a Grant Date
prior to February 9, 2010, as determined in accordance with the following rules:
 
(w)  With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units for which the Performance Period had not been completed
prior to the Change in Control of the Company, the value of such Shares or Units for purposes of this Section 17 shall be equal to the
product of a fraction, where the numerator of such fraction is the number of full calendar months completed during the respective
Performance Period and prior to the Change in Control and the denominator of such fraction is the total number of months in such
Performance Period, multiplied by the largest of:
 
●
the value of such Performance Shares or Performance Units computed as if the Company’s performance during
the remainder of the Performance Period following the Change in Control equaled its performance during those
full calendar quarters completed during the respective Performance Period and prior to the date of the Change in
Control;
 
●
the value of such Performance Shares or Performance Units computed as if the Performance Period for such
Shares or Units was the three consecutive calendar year period ending immediately prior to the year in which the
Change in Control occurs; or
 
●
any other amount approved, in its discretion, by the Committee.
 
(x)  With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units for which the Performance Period has been completed
at the time of a Change in Control of the Company, the value of such Shares or Units for purposes of this Section 17 shall be the
actual value as adjusted to reflect the actual Company performance during the Performance Period.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if a Participant’s employment with the Company or an Affiliate is
terminated without Cause or if the Participant resigns for a Good Reason within eighteen months following a Change in Control of the
Company, then with respect to such Participant each Performance Period shall end and the Company shall immediately distribute in cash or
shares of Common Stock, as appropriate, to such Participant the value of all outstanding Performance Shares and Performance Units granted
under this Plan with a Grant Date of February 9, 2010 or later, as determined in accordance with the following rules:
 
(y)  With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units for which the Performance Period had not been completed prior
to the Participant’s termination or resignation, the value of such Shares or Units for purposes of this Section 17 shall be equal to the
product of a fraction, where the numerator of such fraction is the number of full calendar months completed during the respective
Performance Period and prior to the termination or resignation and the denominator of such fraction is the total number of months in
such Performance Period, multiplied by the largest of:
 
●
the value of such Performance Shares or Performance Units computed as if the Company’s performance during
the remainder of the Performance Period following the termination or
12
 
 
 
resignation equaled its performance during those full calendar quarters completed during the respective
Performance Period and prior to the date of the termination or resignation;
 
●
the value of such Performance Shares or Performance Units computed as if the Performance Period for such
Shares or Units was the three consecutive calendar year period ending immediately prior to the year in which the
termination or resignation occurs; or
 
●
any other amount approved, in its discretion, by the Committee.
 
(z)  With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units for which the Performance Period has been completed by the
time of the Participant’s termination or resignation, the value of such Shares or Units for purposes of this Section 17 shall be the
actual value as adjusted to reflect the actual Company performance during the Performance Period.
 
For purposes of this Section 17, a Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred only if a “change in the ownership”
or a “change in effective control” and/or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of the Company has taken place
(as those terms are defined in Treasury Regulations §1.409A-3(i)(5) or such other regulation or guidance issued under section 409A of the
Code.
 
The Company shall pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses incurred by such Participant
in seeking to obtain or enforce his or her rights under this Section 17, or in connection with any income tax audit or proceeding to the extent
attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to the payments made pursuant to this Section 17, unless a lawsuit commenced by
the Participant for such purposes is dismissed by the court as being frivolous or otherwise improper under applicable court rules.  The
Company shall also pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable tax and financial planning fees and expenses incurred by such
Participant in connection with such Participant's receipt of payments pursuant to this Section 17.  Payment of these legal and accounting fees
and expenses, as well as these tax and financial planning fees and expenses, shall be made as soon as administratively feasible, but no later
than two and one-half months following the end of the Participant’s taxable year in which these fees and expenses have been incurred.
 
18.
Miscellaneous.
 
(a)
Nothing in this Plan or the fact that a person has received or become eligible to receive Awards hereunder shall be
deemed to give such person any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate or to interfere with the right of the
Company or any Affiliate to discipline or terminate the employment of such person at any time for any reason whatsoever.  No person shall
have any claim or right to receive Awards under this Plan, except as provided in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and as approved
by the Committee.  Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Committee, neither the Awards themselves nor the payments received
with respect to such Awards granted under this Plan will be deemed a part of any Participant’s compensation for purposes of determining
such Participant’s payments or benefits under any benefit plan or severance program of the Company or any Affiliate or under the severance
pay law of any country.
 
(b)
This Plan will be unfunded.  The Company does not intend to create any trust or separate fund in connection with the
Plan.  The Company shall not have any obligation to set aside funds or segregate assets to ensure the payment of any Award.  The Plan shall
not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person.  To the extent any person holds any
rights by virtue of an Award under this Plan, such right (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) shall be no greater than the right of
an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(c)
 
Prior to the payment or settlement of any Award, the Participant must pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the
Company and its Affiliates for the payment of any and all tax withholding that in the opinion of the Company and its Affiliates is required
by law.  The Company and its Affiliates shall have the right to deduct from any Award or any payment due on account of any Award
granted under this Plan the federal, state, local or foreign income or other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such Award
or payment, to withhold from the shares of Common Stock being issued or delivered in connection with an Award an appropriate number
of shares for the payment
13
 
 
 
of taxes required by law, and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company and its Affiliates to satisfy all
obligations for the withholding and payment of such taxes.
 
(d)
 
The provisions of this Plan and the documents evidencing Awards granted under this Plan shall be construed and
interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(e)
In case any provision of this Plan shall be ruled or declared invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining provisions, and the remainder of the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had
never been included herein.
 
(f)
To the extent permitted by the Committee, each Participant shall have the right at any time to designate any person,
persons or entity as the beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom payment of the Participant’s outstanding Awards shall be made in the event of
the Participant’s death.  Any designation filed under the Plan may be revoked or changed by written instrument so signed and filed prior to
the Participant’s death.  If a Participant designates more than one beneficiary to receive such Participant’s outstanding Awards and any
beneficiary shall predecease the Participant, the Company shall pay the deceased beneficiary’s share to the surviving beneficiary or
beneficiaries proportionately, as the portion designated by the Participant for each bears to the total portion designated for all surviving
beneficiaries.
 
(g)
This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code (including the Treasury Department guidance and regulations issued thereunder), and shall be construed and
interpreted in accordance with such intent.  If the Committee determines that an Award, Award document, payment, transaction or any other
action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of this Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Participant to become subject to any
additional taxes or other penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then unless the Committee specifically provides otherwise, such Award,
Award document, payment, transaction or other action or arrangement shall not be given effect to the extent it causes such result and the
related provisions of the Plan and/or Award documents will be deemed modified or, if necessary, suspended in order to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case without the consent of or
notice to the Participant.
 
(h)
Although the Company and its Affiliates may endeavor to structure an Award or payment hereunder so that it (i)
qualifies for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment, or (ii) avoids adverse tax treatment, neither the Company nor any Affiliate makes any
representation to that effect and expressly disavows any commitment or obligation to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment
for any Participant.

operating the Program as it may deem necessary or appropriate.  Its power and authority shall include, but not be limited to, making any
amendments to or modifications of the 2005 Program which may be required or necessary to make such Program comply with the
provisions of any laws or regulations of any country or unit thereof in which the Company operates.  To do so, the Committee may establish
different terms and conditions for Awards made to Participants who live in or are subject to taxation in one or more countries other than the
United States in order to accommodate the tax or other relevant laws of such countries.  The Committee may adopt one or more supplements
or sub-plans under the Program to implement these different terms and conditions.
 
SECTION 5  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY
 
To the extent permitted by Delaware law, the Committee may delegate to officers of the Company any or all of its duties, power
and authority under the 2005 Program subject to such conditions or limitations as the Committee may establish; provided, however, that no
officer shall have or obtain the authority to grant Awards to (i) himself or herself, or (ii) any person subject to section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.
 
SECTION 6  TERMS OF AWARDS
 
The Committee shall determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to each Participant, which shall be evidenced by such written or
electronic documents as the Committee shall authorize.  No Participant shall be granted Awards under the 2005 Program with respect to
more than 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock.  The following types of Awards may be granted under this 2005 Program:
 
(a)
Incentive Stock Options – Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall have a purchase price equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.  Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall
become exercisable at such time as shall be established by the Committee and reflected in the documents evidencing such Options, and
unless sooner terminated shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.   
 
(b)
Nonqualified Stock Options – Nonqualified Stock Options granted hereunder shall have a purchase price equal to no less
than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.  Nonqualified Stock Options
granted hereunder shall become exercisable and shall expire at such time or times as shall be established by the Committee and reflected in
the documents evidencing such Options; provided, however, that no Nonqualified Stock Option shall expire later than ten years after the
Grant Date (except that the Committee may extend the exercise period for Nonqualified Stock Options granted to Participants in any
country or countries for an additional period of up to one year if and to the extent necessary to prevent adverse tax consequences to such
Participants under the laws of such country).
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the vested and exercisable portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right that remains outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of its full term on or after April 1, 2016 (or, if applicable, the expiration
of the limited post-termination exercise window occurring on or after April 1, 2016) shall be deemed to have been exercised by the
Participant at such time if (i) the Participant has accepted the Option or Stock
3
 
 
Appreciation Right, (ii) the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock exceeds the applicable exercise price per share, and (iii)
either (A) such Option or Stock Appreciation Right remains outstanding on the last day of its full term or (B) the Participant’s Option or
Stock Appreciation Right otherwise would terminate prior to the last day of its full term as a result of the Participant’s death.  For the
avoidance of doubt, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that terminates upon the expiration of its limited post-termination exercise
window shall not be deemed to have remained outstanding on the last day of its full term for purposes of clause (iii) in the preceding
sentence.  In the event an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised pursuant to this Section, the Company shall deliver to the
Participant the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option or Stock Appreciation Right was deemed exercised, less the
number of shares of Common Stock withheld for the payment of the total purchase price and withholding taxes.
 
(c)
Progressive Stock Options -
 
Whenever
 
a Participant exercises a Nonqualified Stock Option granted under the 2002
Program or its predecessors and makes payment of all or part of the purchase price and withholding taxes, if any, in Common Stock, the
Committee may in its discretion grant such Participant a Progressive Stock Option.  The number of shares subject to such Progressive Stock
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock utilized by the Participant to effect payment of the purchase price and
withholding taxes, if any, for such Nonqualified Stock Option.  Each Progressive Stock Option granted hereunder shall have a purchase
price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Nonqualified
Stock Option, which shall be the Grant Date of such Progressive Stock Option.  Each Progressive Stock Option granted hereunder shall be
exercisable six months after the Grant Date, and shall expire at the same time the Nonqualified Option exercised by the Participant would
have expired. 
 
(d)
Stock Appreciation Rights - The term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Committee and set forth in
the documents evidencing such right, but no Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable more than ten years after the Grant Date.  Each
Stock Appreciation Right shall become exercisable at the time or times determined by the Committee and set forth in the documents
evidencing such right.  Each Stock Appreciation Right granted hereunder shall have a grant price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.
 
(e)
Restricted Stock - At the time a grant of Restricted Stock is made, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish
a Restricted Period and such additional Conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or complete lapse of restrictions
with respect to all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock.  The Committee may also, in its sole
discretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any Conditions with respect to all or any portion of the shares of Common
Stock represented by the Restricted Stock.  The Participant shall generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such
Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock, except that the following restrictions shall apply: (i) the Participant shall
not be entitled to delivery of the shares of such Restricted Stock until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the
satisfaction of any other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred,
assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of other Conditions
prescribed by the Committee, if any; and (iii) all of the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate
without further obligation on the part of the Company unless the Participant shall have remained a regular full-time employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of the other
Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any.  During the Restricted Period, at the sole discretion of the Committee, Dividend
Equivalents may be either currently paid or withheld by the Company for the Participant's account, and interest may be paid on the amount
of cash dividends withheld at a rate and under such terms as determined by the Committee.  Cash or stock dividends so withheld by the
Committee shall not be subject to forfeiture.  Upon the forfeiture of any Restricted Stock, such shares of Common Stock represented by the
Restricted Stock shall be transferred to the Company without further action by the Participant.
 
(f)
Restricted Stock Units - At the time a grant of Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee, in its sole discretion,
shall establish a Restricted Period and such additional Conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or complete lapse
of restrictions with respect to all or any portion of such Restricted Stock Units.  The Committee may also, in its sole discretion, shorten or
terminate the Restricted Period or waive any Conditions with respect to all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units.  During the
Restricted Period, the Participant will not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted Stock Units; provided,
however, that at the sole discretion of the Committee, Dividend Equivalents may be either currently paid in cash or shares or withheld by
the Company for the
4
 
 
Participant’s account and reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units.  Each grant of Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the
following restrictions: (i) the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the shares of Common Stock corresponding to such Restricted
Stock Units until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other Conditions prescribed by the
Committee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted Stock Units may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed
of during the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; and (iii) all of the
Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the
Company unless the Participant shall have remained a regular full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of the other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any.
 
(g)
Other Stock Awards - The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards other than Restricted Stock
grants or Restricted Stock Units, and such Stock Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as
alternatives to grants or rights under this Program or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, including the plan
of any acquired entity.  If the Committee shall stipulate Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the Conditions will be set forth in
documents evidencing the grant.  If Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards shall require the surrender or forfeiture of other grants or
rights under this Program or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the Participant shall not have any
rights under such Stock Awards until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively surrendered or forfeited.
 
SECTION 7  SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS
(a)
Payment of Awards may be in the form of cash, Common Stock or combinations thereof as the Committee shall
determine, and with such other restrictions as it may impose.  The Committee may also require or permit Participants to elect to defer the
issuance of shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under the 2005 Program.  It may
also provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest on the deferral amounts denominated in cash or the
payment or crediting of Dividend Equivalents on deferred settlements denominated in shares.
 
(b)
 
No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to any Participant upon the exercise of an Option until full payment of the
purchase price has been made to the Company and the Participant has remitted to the Company the required federal and state withholding
taxes, if any.  A Participant shall obtain no rights as a stockholder until certificates for such stock are issued to the Participant or delivered to
the MSOP Administrator for credit to the account of the Participant.  Payment of the purchase price or applicable withholding taxes, if any,
may be made in whole, or in part, in shares of Common Stock, pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be established from time to
time by the Committee.  If payment is made in shares of Common Stock, such stock shall be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of their
Fair Market Value on the day the Participant exercised his or her Option or, as regards a withholding tax, such other date when the tax
withholding obligation becomes due.  A Participant need not surrender shares of Common Stock as payment; and the Company may, upon
the giving of satisfactory evidence of ownership of said Common Stock by Participant, deliver the appropriate number of additional shares
of Common Stock reduced by the number of shares required to pay the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes.  Such form of
evidence shall be determined by the Committee.
 
SECTION 8  DELIVERY OF STOCK CERTIFICATES
 
(a)
Within sixty (60) days after completion of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or the complete
satisfaction of Conditions applicable to a Stock Award, the Company will have delivered to the Participant or to the MSOP Administrator
for credit to the account of the Participant certificates representing all shares of Common Stock purchased or received thereunder.  The
Company shall not, however, be required to issue or deliver any certificates for its Common Stock prior to the admission of such stock to
listing on any stock exchange on which stock may at that time be listed or required to be listed, or prior to registration under the Securities
Act of 1933.  The Participant shall have no interest in Common Stock until certificates for such stock are issued or transferred to the
Participant or to the MSOP Administrator for credit to the account of the Participant and the Participant becomes the holder of record.
 
(b)
Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed by the
Committee, if any, the restrictions applicable to a grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units
5
 
 
shall lapse and a stock certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units
shall be delivered to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, representative, or estate, as the case may be, free of all restrictions,
except any that may be imposed by law.  Unless otherwise instructed by a Participant by an irrevocable, written instruction received by the
Company at least six months prior to the date that applicable restrictions lapse, the Company shall automatically withhold as payment the
number of shares of Common Stock, determined by the Fair Market Value at the date of the lapse, required to pay withholding taxes, if
any. 
 
(c)
In no event will the Company be required to deliver any fractional share of Common Stock in connection with any
Award.  In the event that a Participant shall be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with an Award
granted under this 2005 Program, the Company shall pay in cash, in lieu thereof, the Fair Market Value of such fractional share.
 
SECTION 9  TAX WITHHOLDING
 
Prior to the payment or settlement of any Award, the Participant must pay, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for
the payment of, any and all tax withholding that in the opinion of the Company is required by law.  The Company shall have the right to
deduct applicable taxes from any Award payment, to withhold from the shares of Common Stock being issued or delivered in connection
with an Award an appropriate number of shares for the payment of taxes required by law, or to take such other action as may be necessary
in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the withholding of such taxes.
 
SECTION 10  TRANSFERABILITY
 
Except as permitted in this Section 10, no Award granted under this 2005 Program may be assigned, transferred (other than a
transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution as provided in Section 11), pledged, or hypothecated (whether by operation of law or
otherwise).  Awards granted under this 2005 Program shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  The Committee
may, in its sole discretion, permit individual Participants to transfer the ownership of all or any of their Nonqualified Options granted under
this 2005 Program to (i) the spouse, former spouse, children or grandchildren of such Participant (“Immediate Family Members”), (ii) a
trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of such Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a partnership in which such Immediate Family Members
are the only partners, provided that (x) there may be no consideration for any such transfer, and (y) subsequent transfers of transferred
Nonqualified Options shall be prohibited except those in accordance with Section 11 (by will or the laws of descent and distribution).  The
Committee may, in its sole discretion, create further conditions and requirements for the transfer of Nonqualified Options.  Following
transfer, any such Nonqualified Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior
to transfer, provided that for purposes of Sections 7, 8 and 14 hereof the term “Participant” shall be deemed to refer to the transferee.  The
events causing termination of Awards in accordance with Section 11 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original
Participant, following which the Nonqualified Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified
in Section 11.
 
SECTION 11  TERMINATION OF AWARDS
 
(a)
If a Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than (i) a Disqualifying
Termination, (ii) Retirement, (iii) a termination in connection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related
claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights, (iv) a physical or mental disability as recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company, or (v) death, and prior to the date
of termination the Participant has not fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this 2005 Program, such
Participant may exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right within ninety (90) days following the date of termination (but not beyond
the expiration date of such Option or Right) for the number of shares which the Participant could have purchased or received a payment on
the date of termination.  At the conclusion of such ninety-day period (with respect to the Participant’s Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights, and at the time of termination with respect to any other Awards), participation hereunder shall cease and all of the Participant’s
Awards granted under this 2005 Program shall be automatically forfeited unless the documents evidencing such Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights provide otherwise.
 
6
 
 
(b)
If a Participant Retires, terminates employment with the Company and in connection with such termination the Participant
executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the
nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental disability as
recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the
Participant shall be entitled, within the remaining term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (but not beyond the expiration date of
such Option or Right), to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right (provided, however, that in the event of a termination in
connection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with
the approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the additional time to exercise Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights shall apply only to those Options and Stock Appreciation Rights which have vested prior to the date of
termination of employment).  If a Participant who has thus Retired dies, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participant’s death)
may be exercised within two years after the date of his or her death (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the
Participant's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance or
by reason of the death of the Participant.
 
(c)
If a Participant, prior to Retirement, dies without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the
Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participant’s death) may be
exercised within two years following his or her death (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the Participant's estate
or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the
death of the Participant.
 
(d)
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if a Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated before he
or she has fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right under circumstances which the Committee believes to warrant special
consideration and the Committee has determined that the Participant's rights should not be forfeited at the time or times specified in
paragraph (a), the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of termination) may
be exercised within two years following his or her termination of employment (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right).
 
(e)
If a Participant dies, either prior to or following Retirement, or becomes “disabled” within the meaning of section
409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code, and has not yet received the stock certificate for the shares of Common Stock represented by a grant of
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other Stock Award, then all restrictions imposed during the Restricted Period and any other
Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any, shall automatically lapse and a stock certificate shall be delivered to the Participant or the
Participant's beneficiary, representative, or estate, as the case may be upon the Participant’s demonstration to the satisfaction of the
Committee that such Participant is considered “disabled” for purposes of section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code.
 
(f)
If a Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated due to a Disqualifying Termination, participation
hereunder shall cease and all of the Participant’s Awards granted under this 2005 Program shall be automatically forfeited.
 
(g)
If the Committee or the officers to whom it delegates the necessary authority receive or have reason to believe that the
Company has received credible evidence that a Participant may have engaged in activity described in the term “Disqualifying Termination”
in Section 2(h) of this 2005 Program, the Committee or such officers may suspend the exercise, delivery or settlement of all or any portion
of such Participant’s outstanding Awards granted under this 2005 Program pending an investigation of the matter.
 
SECTION 12  ADJUSTMENTS
 
In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of a stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger or similar event, the Committee shall adjust proportionately: (a) the
number of shares of Common Stock (i) available for issuance or delivery under the 2005 Program in accordance with Section 3, (ii) for
which Awards may be granted to a single Participant in accordance with Section 6, and (iii) subject to outstanding Awards granted under
the 2005 Program; (b) the purchase prices of outstanding Awards;

and (c) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations for such Awards.  In the event of any other change affecting the
Common Stock or any distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of Common Stock, such adjustments in the number or kind
of shares and the purchase prices, Fair Market Value and other price determinations of the affected Awards as the Committee shall, in its
sole discretion, determine are equitable, shall be made and shall be effective and binding for all purposes of such outstanding Awards.  In
the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall
be authorized to cause the Company to issue or assume stock options, whether or not in a transaction to which section 424(a) of the Code
applies, by means of substitution of new stock options for previously issued stock options or an assumption of previously issued stock
options.  In such event, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance or delivery under the 2005 Program in
accordance with Section 3 will be increased to reflect such substitution or assumption, and such shares substituted or assumed shall not be
counted against the individual Participant maximum set forth in Section 6.
 
SECTION 13  TERM, AMENDMENT, AND
TERMINATION OF THE 2005 PROGRAM
 
The 2005 Program shall become effective on the date it is approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders of 3M Company, and
shall expire (unless it is terminated before then) on the third anniversary of such effective date.  Such expiration shall not adversely affect
Awards granted under the 2005 Program prior to such expiration date.  The Committee may at any time amend or terminate the 2005
Program, except that no amendment or termination shall adversely affect Awards granted under the 2005 Program prior to the effective date
of such amendment or termination; provided, however, that no amendment shall be made without the prior approval of the Board of
Directors and the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock represented and entitled to vote on such
amendment which would (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance or delivery under the 2005
Program in accordance with Section 3 (except for adjustments made in accordance with Section 12), (ii) permit the granting of Awards with
purchase prices lower than those specified in Section 6, or (iii) be a material amendment for which stockholder approval is required by
applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule.
 
SECTION 14  CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
(a)
For purposes of this Section 14, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated below, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise:
 
(i)
"Person" shall have the meaning associated with that term as it is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act.
 
(ii)
"Affiliates and Associates" shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under
Section 12 of the Act.
 
(iii)
"Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
(iv)
"Continuing Directors" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Article Thirteenth of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of 3M Company.
 
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this 2005 Program to the contrary. all outstanding Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights shall (i) become immediately exercisable in full for the remainder of their respective terms upon the occurrence of a
Change in Control of the Company, and (ii) remain exercisable in full for a minimum period of six months following the Change in
 
Control;
provided, however, that in no event shall any Option or Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable beyond the original expiration date.
 
(c)
Similarly, all restrictions regarding the Restricted Period or the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed by the
Committee, if any, with respect to grants of Restricted Stock or other Stock Awards, shall automatically lapse, expire, and terminate and the
Participant shall be immediately entitled to receive a stock certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the
Restricted Stock or Stock Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control.
 
8
 
 
(d)
For purposes of this Section 14, a Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred only if a “change in the
ownership” or a “change in effective control” and/or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of the Company has
taken place (as those terms are defined in Treasury Regulations §1.409A-3(i)(5) or such other regulation or guidance issued under section
409A of the Code).
 
(e)
In the event that the provisions of this Section 14 result in "payments" that are finally determined to be subject to the
excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall pay to each Participant an additional amount sufficient to fully satisfy
such excise tax and any additional federal, state, and local income taxes payable on the additional amount.  Payment of this additional
amount shall be made as soon as administratively feasible, but no later than two and one-half months following the end of the Participant’s
taxable year in which the amount of the excise tax payable has been determined.
 
(f)
The Company shall pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses
incurred by such Participant in seeking to obtain or enforce his or her rights under this Section 14, or in connection with any income tax
audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to the payments made pursuant to this Section 14,
unless a lawsuit commenced by the Participant for such purposes is dismissed by the court as being frivolous or otherwise improper under
applicable court rules.  The Company shall also pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable tax and financial planning fees and
expenses incurred by such Participant in connection with such Participant's receipt of payments pursuant to this Section 14.  Payment of
these legal and accounting fees and expenses, as well as these tax and financial planning fees and expenses, shall be made as soon as
administratively feasible, but no later than two and one-half months following the end of the Participant’s taxable year in which such fees
and expenses have been incurred.
 
SECTION 15  MISCELLANEOUS
 
(a)
Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Committee, settlements of Awards received by Participants under the
2005 Program shall not be deemed a part of any Participant's compensation for purposes of determining such Participant’s payments or
benefits under any Company benefit plan, severance program, or severance pay law of any country.  Nothing in this 2005 Program shall
prevent the Company from adopting other or additional compensation programs, plans, or arrangements as it deems appropriate or
necessary.
 
(b)
The 2005 Program shall be unfunded.  The Company does not intend to create any trust or separate fund in connection
with the 2005 Program.  The Company shall not have any obligation to set aside funds or segregate assets to ensure the payment of any
Award.  The 2005 Program shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person.  To the
extent any person holds any rights by virtue of an Award under the 2005 Program, such right (unless otherwise determined by the
Committee) shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(c)
No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the 2005 Program, and the Participants shall
have no rights against the Company except as may otherwise be specifically provided herein.  Nothing in this 2005 Program shall be
deemed to give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, or to interfere with the right of the Company to
discipline or discharge such Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever.
 
(d)
The provisions of this 2005 Program and the documents evidencing Awards granted under this 2005 Program shall be
construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Minnesota.
 
(e)
In case any provision of this 2005 Program shall be ruled or declared invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity
shall not affect the remaining provisions, and the remainder of the 2005 Program shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid
provision had never been included herein.

Dear Directors:
 
We are providing this letter to you for inclusion as an exhibit to your Form 10-K filing pursuant to Item 601 of Regulation S-K.
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and issued our report thereon dated February 11, 2016.  Note 1
 
to the financial statements describes a 
change in
accounting principle from a method which classifies marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on management’s
intended holding period
 to a method which classifies marketable securities based on the nature of the securities and their availability
for use in current operations.  It should be understood that the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting
 over another for the
classification of marketable securities
 
has not been addressed in any authoritative accounting literature, and in expressing our
concurrence below we have relied on management’s determination that this change in accounting principle is preferable.  Based on our
reading of management’s stated reasons and justification for this change in accounting principle in the Form 10-K, and our discussions
with management as to their judgment about the relevant business planning factors relating to the change, we concur with management
that such change represents, in the Company’s circumstances, the adoption of a preferable accounting principle in conformity with
Accounting Standards Codification 250, 
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
.
 
Very truly yours,
