DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
2022 was a year of significant change to our business, leadership team, and the 
Company’s direction. While positioning Foot Locker, Inc. for the future, we also remained 
focused on execution, and the team delivered results much better than we expected at 
the beginning of the year.  
Since beginning my journey as your CEO, I have been continually impressed by our 
people’s passion for our customers and the category. I am incredibly honored to lead 
this iconic company that has shaped sneaker culture for so many years. Next year,  
we will celebrate the Foot Locker brand’s 50th anniversary – and today, we are 
positioning ourselves for the next 50 years of growth. To launch that next half-century, 
we recently introduced our new “Lace Up” plan built upon Foot Locker’s right to win  
in the large and growing sneaker market through our brand positioning as the best-
known sneaker retailer and the capabilities we will build to become a more digital and 
omni-channel retailer.
  
LACING UP FOR THE FUTURE 
We intend to simplify, invest in, and grow our business with a clear vision and strategy 
to achieve by 2026 over $9.5 billion of annual revenue and 8.5-9% EBIT margin. 2023 
will be a reset year for Foot Locker, Inc., with sustainable growth in 2024 and beyond, 
supported by new strategic imperatives: 
u Expand Sneaker Culture. Foot Locker, Inc. plays a distinct 
role in sneaker culture. We will harness our multi-branded 
leadership position to expand sneaker culture by serving 
more sneaker occasions, providing more sneaker choice, 
and driving greater sneaker distinction to tap into the 
sneakerhead in all of us.
u Power Up the Portfolio. We will create more distinction 
among our banners, including relaunching the  
Foot Locker brand and transforming our real estate 
footprint by opening new formats, shifting off-mall,  
and closing underperforming stores.
MARY N. DILLON
President and Chief Executive Officer
1Together, we will leverage our assets to elevate the role of our 
retail brand and team members, simplify our business to focus 
on “all things sneakers” and invest in our infrastructure and 
digital capabilities to drive the next 50 years of growth. ”
MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO

u Deepen Our Relationships with Customers. We have only begun 
to realize the value of our FLX loyalty program. We will maximize 
our program to attract a broader range of customers and better 
understand and serve them by leveraging our customer data.  
u  Be Best-in-Class Omni. With an opportunity to increase our digital 
mix, we will accelerate our omnichannel offense by creating key 
enhancements to the customer sneaker journey. We will generate 
powerful and seamless touchpoints across in-store, desktop, 
and mobile experience. A multi-year investment in our technology 
systems will propel discovery and engagement through a more 
personalized and dynamic pre-purchase experience and drive 
connectivity among channels.   
Our “Lace Up” Plan is designed to create value for all of our stakeholders – customers, team members, the 
communities we serve, and investors – and we are incredibly excited to begin executing against this vision.      
2022 STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS 
Even as we developed our new growth plans, we continued in 2022 to execute across dimensions vital to 
our future: simplifying our banner portfolio, diversifying our brand mix, investing in distribution capabilities, 
and opening new formats, including an ongoing shift to a more off-mall store footprint.      
• Simplifying our Operations. We made significant progress to simplify 
our operations to deliver sharper focus on our core assets. This includes 
the sale of our Team Sales business and the wind down of our Eastbay 
consumer business as well as the Sidestep banner in Europe. Furthermore, 
we announced in early 2023 our growth plans in Asia by focusing on the 
licensing business model to continue that region’s progress. We will convert 
our owned stores in Singapore and Malaysia to a license model, while closing 
stores in Macau and Hong Kong. 
• Diversifying our Brand Mix. Non-Nike sales in our core banners grew 
about 10% in 2022 as we continue to optimize our assortment to serve 
consumers’ appetite for choice. As we diversify our portfolio across more 
brands, we are also revitalizing our relationship with Nike to return to growth 
beginning in 2024, further strengthening our offering for consumers. 
   
• Investing in Distribution. We opened our newest distribution facility in Reno, Nevada, establishing a 
three-hub regional system in the United States that allows us to cover over 95% of the country on a two-
day basis versus under 40% just three years ago.
• Opening New Formats and Shifting Off-Mall. We opened 53 new format stores in 2022, including 
our Power and Community formats in 2022, boosting our new format count to 173 on the way to 
attaining our target of over 400 by 2026. Our Off-Mall percent of North America square footage 
increased to 34%, up from approximately 30% in 2021.

While we look to the future, I am proud of the results our team achieved in 2022 
amid significant changes to our business. Following 2021’s record performance, 
total sales in 2022 increased another 0.9%, excluding the impact from changes in 
foreign exchange rates. Including foreign exchange fluctuations, our reported total 
sales declined by 2.4%.  
Overall comparable-store sales declined 1.9% for the year because of tough 
comparisons early in the year related to the federal fiscal stimulus in 2021.  
While that dynamic produced declines in the first half, we registered second-half 
improvement, including a strong 4.2% comp increase in the fourth quarter driven 
by growth across all regions.  
By region, EMEA and Asia-Pacific recorded the most significant growth, with EMEA 
sales up in the high-teens in local currency, reflecting strong tourist spend and returns 
on our investments in key markets. Asia-Pacific climbed nearly 60% in local currency, 
driven by our acquisition of atmos, the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, as well as 
our investments in store, brand, and community experience. In North America, Foot 
Locker and Kids Foot Locker sales for the year were flat to down slightly, although 
sales rose for both in the fourth quarter. Champs Sports sales fell by low-double digits 
as we reposition the banner, and WSS continued to grow stores by nearly 20%. 
The promotional environment accelerated through 2022 as inventory normalized 
compared to the incredibly lean levels across the industry throughout 2021. As a 
result, our gross margin declined by 250 basis points from the high levels historically 
achieved in the prior year. We delevered SG&A by just over 100 basis points as 
inflation pressures more than offset the early stages of our cost optimization program.  
As a result, adjusted EBIT margins fell to 7.9% in 2022 from the 
five-year high of 12.5% reached in 2021. Earnings on an adjusted 
basis were $4.95 per share, down from the record $7.27 per 
share in 2021 but in line with 2019 levels.

BUILDING OUR TEAM FOR THE FUTURE
In November, we strengthened our organization by separating our commercial 
activities from our supply chain and IT functions. This better positions Foot Locker 
to support growth and enhance operating efficiency as we invest in unleashing the 
power of our leading retail banners.  
On the commercial side, Frank Bracken was named Executive Vice President and Chief 
Commercial Officer, which gives sharper focus for leading Foot Locker’s global retail banners, 
merchandising, and marketing, as well as digital, loyalty, and e-commerce. On the Operations 
side, Elliott Rodgers joined the Company as Executive Vice President and Chief Operations 
Officer to oversee supply chain, information technology, procurement,  
and our transformation efforts. He has more than 20 years of leadership 
experience in operations planning, supply chain, logistics, information 
technology, and enterprise data and analytics.
In early 2023, we continued to build our team with the additions 
of Adrian Butler as our Chief Technology Officer, bringing more 
than 20 years of information technology experience across 
consumer sectors, as well as Kim Waldmann as our  
Chief Customer Officer, with more than 10 years of digital 
and marketing experience from various retailers.

conditional verbs, such as “will,” “ should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward 
looking even in the absence of these particular words.  
Examples of forward -looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position,

future events may prove to be inaccurate.  
We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward -looking statements  as a result of new information, future 
events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward -looking statements 
attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward -looking  statements 
contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be 
realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materiall y from those anticipated or implied in the forward -looking statements herein include, but are not limited 
to, a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including the unavailability of premium products at 
competitive prices, volume discoun ts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or  the ability to cancel orders 
and return merchandise; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; volatility in the financial markets or other

policies; credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non -performance by our counterparties;  and any other 
factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.  
All written and oral forward -looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this 
cautionary statement. A forward -looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or 
circu mstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on

business operations and financial performance.  
Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business

statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all of the forward -looking statements contained in this report, or 
any other public statement made  by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect.  
We are including this cautionary note to make applicable, and take advantage of, the safe harbor provisions of the

Item 1A. Risk Factors  
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  
Our inability to implement our long -range strategic plan may adversely affect our future results.  
Our ability to successfully implement and execute our long -range strategic plan is dependent on many factors. Our 
strategies may require significant capital investment and management attention. Additionally, any new ini tiative is 
subject to certain risks including customer acceptance of our products and renovated store designs, competition, 
product differentiation, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and our ability to successfully  integrate our 
acquis itions and  implement technological initiatives. If we cannot successfully execute our strategic growth initiatives 
or if the long -range plan does not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our financial condition 
and results of operati ons may be adversely affected. Additionally, failure to meet shareholder expectations, particularly 
with respect to sales, supplier diversification, cost -cutting programs, operating margins, and earnings per share, would 
likely result in volatility in the market value of our stock.  
The retail athletic footwear and apparel business is highly competitive.  
Our athletic footwear and apparel operations compete primarily with athletic footwear specialty stores, sporting goods 
stores, department stores, traditiona l shoe stores, mass merchandisers, and online  retailers, as well as our 
merchandise vendor suppliers direct -to-customers channels . Although we sell an increasing proportion of our 
merchandise online, a significantly faster shift in customer buying patterns to purchasing athletic footwear, athletic 
apparel, and sporting goods online could have a material adverse effect on our business results.  In addition, all of our 
significant suppliers operate retail stores and distribute products directly through  the internet and  others may follow. 
Should this continue to occur  or accelerate , and if our customers decide to purchase directly from our suppliers, it could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
 
2022 Form 10 -K Page 4 
 The principal competitive factors in our markets are selection of merchandise, customer experience, reputation, store 
location, advertising, and price. We cannot assure that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against 
existing or future co mpetitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors, and entry of new competitors or 
expansion of existing competitors into our markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations.  
A cha nge in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of key products at competitive 
prices could affect our financial health.  
Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to obtain premium  product and the abilit y to purchase 
brand -name merchandise at competitive prices from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, we have negotiated 
volume discounts, cooperative advertising, and markdown allowances with our suppliers, as well as the ability to cancel 
orders an d return excess or unneeded merchandise. We cannot be certain that such terms with our suppliers will 
continue in the future.  
We purchased 86% of our merchandise in 2022 from our top five suppliers and we expect to continue to obtain a 
significant  percenta ge of our athletic product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 65% of all 
merchandise purchased in 2022 was purchased from one supplier  — Nike,  Inc. (“Nike”). Each of our banners are highly 
dependent on Nike. Individually, they purchased approximately 50% to 7 0% of their merchandise from Nike during 
the year. Merchandise that is high profile and in high demand is allocated by our suppliers  based upon their own criteria. 
We cannot be certain that our suppliers will allocate sufficient amoun ts to us in the future or whether our suppliers will 
choose to further sell such merchandise through their own direct -to-customers channel .  
Our inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers as a result of business decisions by ou r 
suppliers, or any disruption in the supply chain, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 
and results of operations. Because of the high proportion  of purchases from Nike, any adverse development in Nike’s 
reputation, f inancial condition or results of operations , or the inability of Nike to develop and manufacture products that 
appeal to our target customers could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations. We cannot be ce rtain that we will be able to acquire merchandise at competitive prices or on competitive 
terms in the future. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results 
of operations.  
The industry in which we operat e is dependent upon fashion trends, customer preferences, product 
innovations, and other fashion -related factors.  
The athletic footwear and apparel industry, especially at the premium end of the price spectrum , in which we operate , 
is subject to changing f ashion trends and customer preferences. In addition, retailers in the athletic industry rely on their 
suppliers to maintain innovation in the products they develop. We cannot guarantee that our merchandise selection will 
accurately reflect customer prefere nces when it is offered for sale or that we will be able to identify and respond quickly 
to fashion changes, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of our merchandise from suppliers. A 
substantial portion of our highest margin sales are t o young males (ages 12 –25), many of whom we believe purchase 
athletic footwear and athletic apparel as a fashion statement and are frequent purchasers. Our failure to anticipate, 
identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in fashion tren ds that would make athletic footwear or 
athletic apparel less attractive to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations.  
If we do not successfully manage our inventory levels, our opera ting results will be adversely affected.  
We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against 
accumulating excess inventory. For example, we order most of our footwear four to six  months pri or to delivery to us. 
If we fail to anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise or our customers’ purchasing habits, we may 
be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow -moving inventory, which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
We are affected by mall traffic and our ability to secure suitable store locations , both in malls and off -malls . 
Many of our stores, especially in North America  where only 26% of our locations are off -mall, are located primarily in 
enclosed regional and neighborhood malls. Our sales are affected, in part, by the volume of mall traffic. Mall traffic may 
be adversely affected by, among other factors, economi c downturns, the closing or continued decline of anchor 
department stores and/or specialty stores, and a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers.  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 5 
 Further, any terrorist act, natural disaster, public health  issue, such as COVI D-19, flu or other pandemics,  or safety 
concern that decreases the level of mall traffic, or that affects our ability to open and operate stores in such locations, 
could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire 
stores in desirable locations , such as in regional and neighborhood malls, as well as high -traffic urban retail areas and 
high streets. We cannot be certain that desirable locati ons will continue to be available at favorable rates. Some 
traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic, driven by economic conditions , 
public health  issues, the closure of certain mall anchor tenants , and chan ges in customer shopping preferences, such 
as online shopping . Further, some malls have closed, and others may close in the future. While we seek to obtain 
suitable locations off -mall, there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such locations.  
Several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls and because of our dependence upon these landlords 
for a substantial number of our locations, any significant erosion of their financial condition or our relationships with 
them  could negatively a ffect our ability to obtain and retain store locations. Additionally, further landlord consolidation 
may negatively affect our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms.  
Our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operat ions of the businesses we 
have acquired, or may acquire.  
We have recently made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in the future based on available opportunities in the 
market. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluat ing acquisition opportunities, 
properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other 
resource constraints.  There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integr ating 
operations, personnel, and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; 
unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from 
running our existin g businesses; and potential loss of key management or customers of the acquired business.  
Our future growth may depend on our ability to expand operations in international markets.  
Our future growth will depend , in part , on our ability to expand our busi ness in additional international markets. As we 
expand into new international markets, we may have only limited experience in operating our business in such markets. 
In other instances, we may have to rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business p artners in such markets. In 
addition, business practices in these new international markets may be unlike those in the other markets we serve, and 
we may face increased exposure to certain risks. Our future growth may be materially adversely affected if we are 
unsuccessful in our international expansion efforts.  Our inability to expand in international markets could have a material 
adverse effect on our business.  
We may experience fluctuations in, and cyclicality of, o ur comparable -store sales results.  
Our comparable -store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, and we 
expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable -store sa les results, including, 
among others, fashion trends, product innovation, promotional events, the highly competitive retail sales environment, 
economic conditions, timing of income tax refunds, changes in our merchandise mix, calendar shifts of holiday per iods, 
declines in foot traffic, supply chain disruptions, and weather conditions. Many of our products represent discretionary 
purchases. Accordingly, customer demand for these products could decline in an economic downturn or if our 
customers develop othe r priorities for their discretionary spending. These risks could have a material adverse effect on 
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
The effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, acts of violence, and public health issues , such as 
COVID -19, may adversely affect our business.  
Natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes may affect store and dist ribution center 
operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have 
a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from suppli ers 
for sale to our customers. Any act of violence, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, that are targeted 
at or threatened against shopping malls, our stores, offices or distribution centers, could result in restricted access to 
our stores and/or store closures in the short -term and, in the long -term, may cause our customers and employees to 
avoid visiting our stores. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the retaliatory measures taken by the U.S., NATO , and 
other countries have cr eated global security concerns and economic uncertainty that could have a lasting effect on 
regional and global economies .  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 6 
 Public health issues, such as  COVID -19, flu, or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, 
could disrupt our  operations  and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our 
infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business . Additionally, public health issues may disrupt, 
or have an adverse effect on, our  suppliers’ operations, our operations, our customers, or result in significantly lower 
traffic to or closure of our stores,  or customer demand. Our ability to mitigate the adverse effect of these events depends, 
in part, upon the effectiveness of our disa ster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity 
planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an 
actual disaster.  
Any significant declines in public safety or uncerta inties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer 
spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products.  We may be required to 
suspend operations in some or all of our locations  and incur significant costs  to remediate concerns  which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
Riots, vandalism, and other crimes and acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our 
customers, delivery o f our products and customer service, and could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, results of operations, or financial condition.  
Our business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption, or destruction, regardless of cause, including riots, 
civil insurrection or social unrest, and manmade disasters or crimes. Such events may result in property damage and 
loss and may also cause customers to suspend their decisions to shop in our stores, interrupt our supply chain, and 
cause r estrictions, postponements, and cancellations of events that attract large crowds and public gatherings, such as 
store marketing events.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be 
immaterial also may advers ely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.  
Risks Related to Technology, Data Security , and Privacy  
We are subject to technology risks including failures, security breaches, and cybersecurity risks that could 
harm our business, damag e our reputation, and increase our costs in an effort to protect against these  risks.  
Information technology is a critical part of our business operations. We depend on information systems to process 
transactions, analyze customer behaviors through our loy alty program, make operational decisions, manage inventory, 
operate our websites, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost -efficient operations . There is 
a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of informatio n, or reputational damage as a result of a 
cyber -attack, such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information, either internally or 
through  our third -party providers. In addition, cybersecurity researchers anticipate an incr ease in cyberattack activity in 
connection with the  Russian invasion  of Ukraine.   
We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, system 
implementation issues, viruses, malicious hackers, sabotage, or oth er causes.  We invest in security technology to 
protect the data stored by us, including our data and business processes, against the risk of data security breaches 
and cyber -attacks. Our data security management program includes enforcement of standard dat a protection policies 
such as Payment Card Industry compliance  and other regulatory requirements . Additionally, we evaluate  our major 
technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security assessment  measures. We maintain and 
routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an 
independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.  
While we believe that our security technology and processes follow appropriat e practices in the prevention of security 
breaches and the mitigation of cybersecurity risks, given the ever -increasing abilities of those intent on breaching 
cybersecurity measures and given the necessity of our reliance on the security procedures of thir d-party vendors, the 
total security effort at any point in time may not be completely effective.  
Failure of our systems,  either internally or at our third -party providers,  including failures due to cyber -attacks that would 
prevent the ability of systems t o function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and 
negative consequences to us, our employees, and those with whom we do business. A cyberattack on a 
communications network or power grid could cause operational disrupt ion resulting in loss of revenues.  Any security 
breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by us could 
also severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, i ncrease operating costs associated 
with remediation, and harm our business. While we carry insurance that would mitigate losses  in connection with 
security breaches and cyber incidents , insurance may be insufficient to compensate us fully for potentially significant 
losses.  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 7 
 Risks associated with digital operations.  
Our digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including risks related to the failure of the computer systems that 
operate our websites , mobile sites , and apps  and their relat ed support systems, computer viruses, cybersecurity risks, 
telecommunications  or power  failures, denial of service attacks, bot attacks, and similar disruptions. Also, to sustain , 
keep current,  or grow our digital commerce business  we will need to make add itional investments . Risks related to 
digital commerce include those associated with credit card fraud, the need to keep pace with rapid technological 
change, governmental regulation, and legal uncertainties with respect to internet  regulatory compliance. If any of these 
risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
Privacy and data security concerns and regulation could result in additional costs and liabilities.  
The protection of customer, employee, and Company data is critic al. The regulatory environment surrounding privacy 
is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, customers appear 
increasingly to have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information . Any actual or 
perceived misappropriation or breach involving this data could cause our customers to lose confidence in our ability to 
protect their data, which may cause them to potentially stop shopping with us or joining our loyalty program, attract 
negative media attention, cause harm to our reputation or result in liability (including but not limited to fines, penalties 
or lawsuits), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, 
and cash fl ows.  
Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We 
are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws 
and regu lations will likely continue to evolve over time . 
The European Union (“E.U.”) adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”), which requires 
companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, incl uding its use, protection, 
and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR , 
including UK GDPR post -Brexit , requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.  
Data protection legislation and enforcement is also becoming increasingly common in the Asia Pacific region and in the 
United States at both the federal and state level. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer 
Privacy Act of 2018 (the “ CCPA ”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things,  requires 
companies that process information of California residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, 
use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new 
cause of  action for data breaches. Effective starting January 1,  2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) 
has revise d and significantly expand ed the scope of the CCPA . The CPRA, among other things, also creates a new 
California data protection agency a uthorized to implement and enforce the CCPA  and the CPRA, which could result in 
increased privacy and information security enforcement. Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia have also enacted 
comprehensive consumer privacy laws, and other states may follow . Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission 
and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for 
the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA , CPR A, and other 
similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to further modify our data processing 
practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.  The laws and regulations relating to 
privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever -increasing regulatory 
and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement , sanctions , and private litigation . 
The technology enablement of omni -channel in our business is complex.  
We continue to invest in initiatives designed to deliver a high -quality, coordinated shopping experience online, in stores, 
and on mobile devices, which requires substantial investment in technology, information systems, and employee 
training, as well as significant management time and resources. Our omni -channel retailing efforts include the 
integration and implementation of new technology, software, and processes to be able to fulfill orders from any point 
within our system of stores and distribution centers, which is extremely complex and may not meet customer 
expectations for timely and accurate deliveries. These efforts involve substantial risk, including risk of implementation 
delays, cost overruns, technology interruptions, supply  and distribution delays, and other issues that can affect the 
successful implementation and operation of our omni -channel initiatives. If our omni -channel initiatives are not 
successful we may not be able to provide a relevant shopping experience,  or we may not realize the return on our omni -
channel investments that we anticipate, our financial performance and future growth could be materially adversely 
affected.

 Risks Related to our Operation s and Supply Chain  
Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect 
our business.  
We operate multiple distribution centers worldwide , as well as third -party arrangements , to support our operations in 
the United States, Canada, England, Australia , New Zealand , and Asia .  
If complications arise with any facility or third -party arrangements, or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, 
our other distribution centers may be unable to support the resulting additional distribution demands. We a lso may be 
affected by disruptions in the global transportation network caused by events including delays caused by port disruption, 
port strikes, weather conditions, work stoppages,  or other labor unrest. These factors may adversely affect our ability 
to deliver inventory on a timely basis. We depend  upon third -party carriers for shipment of merchandise . Any interruption 
in service by these carriers for any reason could cause disruptions in our business, a loss of sales and profits, and other 
material adve rse effects.  
Manufacturer compliance with our social compliance program requirements.  
We require our independent manufacturers to comply with our policies and procedures, which cover many areas 
including human rights policy, labor, health and safety, and e nvironmental standards. We monitor compliance with our 
policies and procedures using internal resources, as well as third -party monitoring firms. Although we monitor their 
compliance with these policies and procedures, we do not control the manufacturers o r their practices. Any failure of 
our independent manufacturers to comply with our policies and procedures or local laws in the country of manufacture 
could disrupt the shipment of merchandise to us, force us to locate alternate manufacturing sources, redu ce demand 
for our merchandise, or damage our reputation.  
Our reliance on key management.  
Future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management 
teams. Our future performance depends , to a signif icant extent , both upon the continued services of our current 
executive and senior management teams, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain additional qualified 
management in the future. We have succession plans in place and our Boar d of Directors reviews these succession 
plans.  If our succession plans do not adequately cover significant and unanticipated turnover, the loss of the services 
of any of these individuals, or any resulting negative perceptions or reactions, could damage ou r reputation and our 
business.    
Additionally, our success depends on the talents and abilities of our workforce in all areas of our business, especially 
personnel that can adapt to complexities and grow their skillset across the changing environment. Our ability to 
successfully execute our strategy depends on attracting, developing and retaining qualified talent with diverse sets of 
skills, especially functional and technology specialists that directly support our strategies.  
Risks associated with attracti ng and retaining store and field team members . 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified store and 
field team members . The turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. If we a re unable to attract and retain 
quality team members , our ability to meet our growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be 
compromised.  
We have experienced unusually low availability of workers, which we believe was primarily attributable to COVID -19 
pandemic -related factors and in turn has created increased competition in labor markets.  Our ability to meet our labor 
needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing w age rates, 
minimum wage legislation, and overtime regulations . 
Risks Related to our Investments  
If our long -lived tangible assets and operating lease right -of-use assets,  or goodwill become impaired, we may 
need to record significant non -cash impairment ch arges.  
We review our long -lived tangible assets , operating lease right -of-use assets, and  goodwill when events indicate that 
the carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise 
and, at a min imum, annually.  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 9 
 Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test, which consists of either a qualitative assessment on a 
reporting unit level, or a quantitative  impairment test, if necessary. The determination of impairment charges is 
signif icantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value. Our estimates of future 
operating cash flows are identified from our long -range strategic plans, which are based upon our experience, 
knowledge, and expectations; how ever, these estimates can be affected by factors such as our future operating results, 
future store profitability, and future economic conditions, all of which are difficult to predict accurately. Any significant 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions c ould affect the fair value of our long -lived assets , operating lease right -of-
use assets, and  goodwill  and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of 
operations.  
We do not have the ability to exert control over o ur minority investments, and therefore , we are dependent on 
others in order to realize their potential benefits.  
At January 28 , 2023 we hold $ 630 million  of non-controlling minority investments in various  entities and we may make 
additional strategic minority investments in the future. Such minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of 
control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational , and compl iance risks 
associated with the investments. Other investors in these entities may have business goals and interests that are not 
aligned with ours or may exercise their rights in a manner in which we do not approve. These circumstances could lead 
to delay ed decisions or disputes and litigation with those other investors, all of which could have a material adverse 
impact on our reputation, business, financial condition , and results of operations.  
If our investees seek additional financing to fund their grow th strategies, these  financing transactions may result in 
further dilution of our ownership stakes and these  transactions may occur at lower valuations than the investment 
transactions through which we acquired such interests, which could significantly dec rease the fair values of our 
investments in those entities. Additionally, if our investees are unable to obtain additional  financing, those entities could 
need to significantly reduce their spending in order to fund their operations  or result in their inso lvency . These  actions 
likely would result in reduced growth forecasts, which also could significantly decrease the fair values of our investments 
in those entities.  
Risks Related to Internal Controls, Shareholder Activism, Geopolitics,  Regulations, and Oth er External Risks  
We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to 
improve our internal controls, our financial results may not be accurately reported.  
 
As disclosed in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures, ” we identified a material weakness in our control over financial 
reporting related to our newly acquired WSS business. The material weakness did not result in any identified 
misstatements to the financial statements, and there were  no changes to previously issued financial results. We are 
actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness; however, we cannot 
guarantee that these steps will be sufficient or that we will not have a material we akness in the future. This material 
weakness, or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls or remediation, could prevent us from 
accurately reporting our financial results, result in material misstatements in our financial statement s or cause us to fail 
to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively 
affect our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.  
We may face risks associated with shareholder activism.  
Publicly -traded companies are subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions related to matters 
such as corporate governance, operational practices , and strategic direction . We may b ecome subject in the future to 
such shareholder activity and demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, 
be costly and time -consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management , any of which  could have 
an adverse effect on our business or stock price.   
Economic or political conditions in other countries, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
and tax rates may adversely affect our operations.   
A significant portion of our sales and operating income for 2022  was attributable to our operations outside of the United 
States . As a result, our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States 
such as local cu stomer product preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in economic 
conditions in countries in which we operate, foreign currency fluctuations, real estate costs, and labor and employment 
practices in non -U.S. jurisdiction s that may differ significantly from those that prevail in the United States.  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 10 
 In addition, because our suppliers manufacture a substantial amount of our products in foreign countries, our ability to 
obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on favorable  terms may be affected by governmental regulations, trade 
restrictions, labor, and other conditions in the countries from which our suppliers obtain their product.  
Fluctuations in the value of the euro and the British Pound may affect the value of our Euro pean earnings when 
translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly , our earnings in other jurisdictions  may be affected by the value of currencies 
when translated into U.S. dollars. Except for our business in the United Kingdom (the “U.K .”), our international 
subs idiaries conduct most of their business in their local currency. Inventory purchases for our U.K. business are 
generally denominated in euros, which could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses.  
Our products are subject to import and excise  duties and/or sales or value -added taxes in many jurisdictions. 
Fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on 
our results of operations and financial condition.   
Our stock price m ay be volatile, and the value of our common stock has declined and may continue to decline.  
The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a 
variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation:  
• a change in the relationship with any of our key  suppliers or the unavailability of key products at competitive 
prices;  
• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;  
• variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts  and securities a nalysts  may 
issue unfavorable research about us;  
• changes in our projected operating and financial results;  
• announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new 
offerings;  
• significant data breaches;  
• material liti gation;  
• future sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;  
• changes in senior management or key personnel;  
• the trading volume of our common stock;  
• changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate o f our market; and  
• general macroeconomic, geopolitical, and market conditions beyond our control.  
 
Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, such 
as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may also negatively affect the market price 
of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have 
been subject to securities class action litigation . We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could 
result in substantial expenses and divert our management’s attention.  
Macroeconomic developments may adversely affect our business.  
Our performance is subject to global economic conditions and the related effects on consumer spending levels. 
Continued uncertainty about global economic conditions , including the COVID -19 pandemic,  poses a risk as consumers 
and businesses may postpone spending in  response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news, and/or 
declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products.  The 
invasion of Ukraine by Russia ha s created global security concerns and economic uncertainty.  
As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes 
in macroeconomic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result  of job 
losses, foreclosures, bankrupt cies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access 
to credit, and lower home values. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, 
which could adversely affect our financial conditi on and operating results.  
  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 11 
 Significant developments stemming from the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company.  
The U.K. formally exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and entered into 
a new trade agreement with the European Union on December 24, 2020. De spite the U.K.’s December 2020 trade 
agreement, ma ny potential future effects of Brexit remain unclear and could adversely affect certain areas of our 
business , including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products,  and adverse effects 
to our suppliers .  
We have significant operations in both the U.K. and the E.U., and we are highly dependent on the free flow of labor and 
goods in those regions. In response to Brexit, in February 2020 we engaged with a third -party logistics provider within 
England to mitigate supply chain risks. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in 
the U.K., Europe or globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, Brexit 
could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which 
E.U. laws to replace or replicate, i ncluding data protection regulation. Compliance with any new laws and regulations 
may be cumbersome, difficult, or costly.   
There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate effect of Brexit and outcomes could disrupt the markets 
we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This uncertainty creates challenges (particularly in the near 
term) with respect to trading relationships between our U.K. subsidiary and other E.U. nations. These possible effects 
of Brexit could adversely affect  our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  
Imposition of tariffs and export controls on the products we buy may have a material adverse effect on our 
business.  
A significant portion of the products that we purchase, including the porti on purchased from U.S. -based suppliers, as 
well as most of our private brand merchandise, is manufactured abroad. We may be affected by potential changes in 
international trade agreements or tariffs, such as new tariffs imposed on certain Chinese -made good s imported into the 
U.S. Furthermore, China or other countries may institute retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future 
tariffs imposed by the U.S. that could have a negative effect on our business. If any of these events occur as describ ed, 
we may be obligated to seek alternative suppliers for our private brand merchandise, raise prices, or make changes to 
our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, results of operations, 
and financial  condition.  
Increasing inflation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations , or cash 
flows.  
Inflation, as well as some of the measures taken by or that may be taken by the governments in countries where we 
operate in an  attempt to curb inflation , may have negative effects on the economies of those countries generally. If the 
United States or other countries where we operate experience substantial inflation in the future, our business may be 
adversely affected. Fewer cust omers may shop as these purchases may be seen as discretionary, and those who do 
shop may limit the amount of their purchases. Any reduced demand or changes in customer purchasing behavior may 
lead to lower sales, higher markdowns and an overly promotional  environment or increased marketing and promotional 
spending.  This could have a material adverse effect  on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash 
flows.   
Instability in the financial markets may adversely affect our business.  
The global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by, among other things, instability in global 
economic markets, disruptions to the banking system and financial market volatility resulting from bank failures, 
increased U.S. trade  tariffs and trade disputes with other countries, instability in the global credit markets, supply chain 
weaknesses, instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of Brexit , the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and 
other political tensions, and fo reign governmental debt concerns. Such challenges have caused, and may continue to 
cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets.  
The phase out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely a ffect our access to the capital 
markets and cost of funding.  The Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule in December 2022 that replaces LIBOR 
in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. Our revolving c redit agreement provides for alternative met hods of 
calculating the interest rate payable on indebtedness thereunder.  
  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 12 
 This volatility may affect our future access to the credit and debt security markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, 
or, in some cases, the inability to obtain additional finan cing. Although we currently have a revolving credit agreement 
in place until July  14, 2025, tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance 
our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, o r obtain funding through the issuance of the 
Company’s securities.   
Material changes in the market value of the securities we hold may adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition.  
At January 28 , 2023 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $536  million.  The majority of our investments were short -
term deposits in highly -rated banking institutions. We regularly monitor our counterparty credit risk and mitigate our 
exposure by making short -term investments only in highly -rated instituti ons and by limiting the amount we invest in any 
one institution. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties. At January  28, 2023 , all investments 
were in investment grade institutions. Despite an investment grade rating, it is possib le that the value or liquidity of our 
investments may decline due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and bank -specific credit 
issues.  
Our U.S. pension plan trust holds assets totaling $509  million at January  28, 2023. The fair va lues of these assets held 
in the trust are compared to the plan’s projected benefit obligation to determine the pension funding liability. We attempt 
to mitigate funding risk through asset diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk of our po rtfolio through 
quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible 
that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditi ons 
and credit issues. Such declines could affect the funded status of our pension plan and future funding requirements.  
Our financial results may be adversely affected by tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.  
We are a U.S. -based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our provision 
for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory rates, and enacted tax rules, including transfer 
pricing. Significant judgment  is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions 
on a worldwide basis. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including shifts in the 
mix of pretax results by tax jurisdictio n, changes in tax laws or related interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate, and tax assessments and related interest and penalties resulting from income tax audits.  Further, many 
countries continue to consider changes in their tax laws by i mplementing new taxes such as the digital service tax and 
initiatives such as the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development’s Pillar II global minimum tax. Various 
countries are in the process of incorporating the Pillar II framework within th eir tax laws.  
Changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.  
Various foreign and domestic labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect our operating costs. 
These laws include , but are not limited to,  minimum wage r equirements, overtime , sick, and premium  pay, paid time 
off, work scheduling, healthcare reform and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the Protecting the Right 
to Organize Act, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, European works council requirements, and 
union organization.  
A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including  additional government -imposed increases in 
minimum wages, overtime , sick,  and premium  pay, paid leaves of absence , mandated health benefits, and changing 
regulations from the National Labor Relations Board or other agencies. Complying with any new legislation  or 
interpretation of law,  or reversing changes implemented under existing law  could be time -intensive and expensive and 
may affect our business.  
Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change concerns may negatively affect our business.  
Greenhouse gases may have an adverse effec t on global temperatures, weather pattern s, and the frequency and 
severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural 
disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible f or 
us to deliver products to our customers, create delays , and inefficiencies in our  supply chain. Following an interruption 
to our business, we could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, 
and lose sig nificant sales. Concern over  climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative, regulatory , 
and compliance  requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result 
in future tax, transportation , and utility increases , which could adversely affect our business .  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 13 
 There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders , on these and other 
sustainability matters, such as  worker safety , the use of plastic, energy  cons umption , and waste.  
We face reputational, regulatory, human capital, and business development risks from a perceived or actual 
failure to effectively manage our material ESG risks and opportunities.  
Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to ESG matters, 
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Our global ESG 
program is focused on the following four pillars through which we believe w e may significantly impact our stakeholders, 
or which may pose a material risk or opportunity for our business: (1) Leveraging the Power of Our People and 
Communities, (2) Strengthening the Sustainability of Our Supply Chain, (3) Managing and Reducing Our Environmental 
Impacts, and (4) Operating Ethically and Transparently. These focus areas could prove to be the wrong focus areas, 
or not the most material focus areas, for our business.  
In light of increasing regulatory, customer, team member, investor, and  societal scrutiny of businesses’ management 
of material ESG issues, we may face a number of related risks, including making insufficient progress on or failing to 
identify all material ESG issues, resulting in potentially significant negative impacts on o ur stakeholders and related 
reputational harm; being perceived as having a superficial commitment to ESG without meaningfully addressing 
stakeholder impacts, risks, and opportunities, thereby potentially reducing important stakeholders’ willingness to be 
associated with, do business with, or be employed by us; an inability to control or avoid stakeholders politicizing our 
ESG positions, causing potential reputational harm among segments of our important stakeholders; or failing to comply 
with rapidly develo ping regulation on ESG in various jurisdictions, which may compromise our credibility, cause 
reputational harm, or lead to legal proceedings against us . 
Increasing attention to ESG matters may also cause certain institutional investors to be discouraged fr om investing in 
us. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, and other influential investors are also 
increasingly focused on ESG practices and , in recent years , have placed increasing importance on the implications and 
social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG and 
similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a 
result of the ir assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or 
stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded 
appropriately to the growing concern for ESG iss ues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may 
suffer from reputational damage , and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be 
materially and adversely affected.  In addition, the importance of ES G scoring evaluations is becoming more broadly 
accepted by shareholders. Certain organizations have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based 
upon certain ESG metrics. Many shareholders focus on positive ESG business practices and scores whe n making 
investments and may consider a company’s score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision.  
In addition, certain investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their 
peers a nd if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG 
disclosure or performance. We may face reputational damage in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not 
meet the standards set by various cons tituencies. A low score could result in a negative perception of us, or exclusion 
of our common stock from consideration by certain investors. In addition, the cost of  compliance to receive high ESG 
scores may be considerable.   
We may be adversely affected  by regulatory and litigation developments.  
We are exposed to the risk that federal or state legislation may negatively affect our operations. Changes in federal or 
state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement progra ms, including  health 
insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation could increase our cost of doing business or 
otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, we are regularly involved in litigation, including commercia l, tort, 
intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, anti -corruption , and other claims, including 
purported class action lawsuits. The cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution 
of su ch claims, whether by settlement , mediation, arbitration,  or adverse court  or agency  decision, may harm our 
business.  
  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 14 
 We operate in many different jurisdictions  and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti -corruption laws.  
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti -corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery 
Act of 2010, which is broader in scope than the FCPA, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from 
making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Our internal 
policies mandate compliance wi th these anti -corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot 
be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts 
committed by our employees or agents. Our continued ex pansion outside the United States, including in developing 
countries, could increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such 
violations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations o r financial condition.  
International intellectual property protection can be uncertain and costly.  
Uncertainty in intellectual property protection can result from conducting business  outside the United States, particularly 
in jurisdictions that do not have  comparable levels of protection for our assets such as intellectual property, copyrights, 
and trademarks. Continuing to operate in such foreign jurisdictions where the ability to enforce intellectual property 
rights is limited increases our exposure to ri sk. 
Risks Related to our Indebtedness and our Credit Facility  
Our debt may cause an adverse effect on our business.  
During 2021, we completed the sale of $400 million of 4% Senior Notes due 2029. Our inability to generate sufficient 
cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our debt obligations could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, results of operations , and other corporate requirements . This could require us to direct a substantial portion 
of our future cash flow toward payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available 
to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate requirements, thereby limiting our ability to respond 
to business opportunities.  
We may be unable to draw on our credit facility in the future.  
Borrowings and letters of credit under our credit facility are not permitted to exceed a borrowing base, which is tied to 
our level of  inventory. Therefore, reductions in the value of our inventory would result in a reduction in our borrowing 
base, which would reduce the amount of financial resources available to meet our operating requirements. Also, if we 
do not comply with our financi al covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders, the lenders 
may elect to cause any amounts then owed to become immediately due and payable , or they may decline to renew our 
credit facility. In that event, we would seek to establis h a replacement credit facility with one or more other lenders, 
including lenders with which we have an existing relationship, potentially on less desirable terms. There can be no 
guarantee that replacement financing would be available at commercially reas onable terms, if at all.  
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  
None  
Item 2. Properties  
Our properties consist of land, leased stores, administrative facilities, and distribution centers. Gross square footage 
and total selling area for our store locations  at the end of 2022  were approximately  13.15  and 7.92 million square feet, 
respectively. These properties, which are primarily leased, are located in t he United States and its territories, Canada, 
various European countries, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.   
As of January 28, 2023, we operated eight  distribution centers, of which two are owned and six are leased, occupying 
an aggregate of 3. 85 million s quare  feet. Six of these distribution centers are in the United State s, one in Canada, and 
one in the Netherlands. Additionally, we utilize the services of third -party providers for our operations in the U.K., 
Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. In connectio n with the closure of the Eastbay business, its distribution center will be 
closed in early 2023. We also own a manufacturing facility and operate a leased warehouse in the United States, which 
support our Team Edition apparel business.   
We believe that al l leases of properties that are material to our operations may be renewed, or that alternative properties 
are available, on terms similar to existing leases.

Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased by 0.9% as compared to the prior -year 
period.  
• Our footwear sales represented 80% of total sales , while  apparel and accessory sales were 20%, consi stent 
with last year ’s distribution of sales .  
• Sales and comparable sales both decreased in 2022 compared to our record year in 2021.

Comparable -store sales increase/(decrease)     (1.9) %    15.4 %    (5.9) % 
 
• The percentage  of our direct -to-customers sales channel decreased to 17. 5% of total sales in 2022 as 
compared with the prior year which represented 21.5% of total sales. The results in 2021 reflected some 
remaining effects from the COVID -19 pandemic . We are making ongoing investments in our omni -channel 
ecosystem, including our e -commerce experience and supply chain capabilities, in order to create seamless 
shopping experience s across all of our sales channels.  
• Gross margin, as a  percentage of sales, decreased to 31.9% as a result  of a more promotional marketplace 
during 2022. We took pricing actions in line with the market in order to ensure that our inventory position 
remaine d current and corresponding with sales trends.  
• SG&A expenses were 21.8% of sales, an increase of 110 basis points as compared with the prior  year. The 
increase primarily reflected higher compensation costs and the effect of the prior -year payroll subsidies  
recorded in connection with the COVID -19 pandemic.  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 19 
 • Our newly acquired businesses of WSS and atmos were both accretive to earnings. We continued to be excited 
about the growth potential in both these banners.  
• We substantially completed the wind down of the  Footaction banner during 2022 and recently announced the 
closure of our underperforming Sidestep banner, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023.  
• Net income attributable to Foot Locker, Inc. was $342 million, or $3. 58 diluted earnings  per share. The 
$551  million decrease from the prior -year period reflected a $426 million reduction in other income, primarily 
from fair value adjustments to our minority investments , and a reduction in income from operations .  
• Adjusted net income was $473  million, or $4.95 diluted earnings per share, as compared with adjusted net 
income of $755 million, or $7.27 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year.

at a cost of $129 million. In February 202 3, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.40 per share 
payable  in April 2023 . These initiatives demonstrate our commitment to continue delivering meaningful returns 
to our shareholders.  
Reconciliation of Non -GAAP Measures  
In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we 
report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. In the following tables, we have presented 
certain financial measures  and ratios identified as non -GAAP such as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”), 
adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income 
margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, Return o n Invested Capital (“ROIC”), and free cash flow.  
Effective with the first quarter of 2022, the calculation for non -GAAP earnings excludes gains and losses from all 
minority investments, including the adjustments related to the investment in Retailors, Ltd . We believe this is a more 
representative measure of our recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results, and is consistent with how 
management reviews performance. The non -GAAP results for prior periods  have been recast, as applicable, to con form 
to the current year’s presentation.  
We present these non -GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across 
reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core busines s or which affect 
comparability. These non -GAAP measures are also useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long -term 
financial objectives.  
Additionally, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which ar e also 
considered non -GAAP measures. Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both  years using 
the prior -year aver age foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors 
because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency 
movements.  
We estim ate the tax effect of the non -GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal rate to each of the respective items. 
The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.  
The non -GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not  as an alternative to, our reported results prepared 
in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non -GAAP results discussed throughout 
this Annual Report on Form 10 -K. All adjusted amounts exclude the loss from discontinued ope rations. Please see the 
non-GAAP reconciliations for free cash flow in the “ Liquidity and Capital Resources ” section.

2022, we recognized a  $19 million ($12 million after tax) gain on the sale of our Eastbay Team Sales business. Non -cash gains of $290 million 
($214 million after tax) and $190 million ($140 million after tax) in 2021 and 2020 , respectively,  related to our minority investment in GOAT, which 
is measured using the fair value measurement alternative and received additional funding at higher valuations than our initia l investment.  In 
2021, this caption also included $7 million ($5 million after tax) related to the finalization of the insurance claim associated with the prior year 
social unrest.  
See the Other Income / (Expense), net  section for further information.  
(3) We recognized a charge to discontinued operations of $4 million ($3 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2022  related to the resolution of 
a legal matter of a business we formerly operated .  
(4) In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the resolution of a foreign tax settlement.  
(5) We recognized tax charges of $1 million and $5 million during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with tax law 
changes in the Netherlands.   
(6) We recorded tax charges related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property right s, pursuant to a non -U.S. advance pricing agreement of 
$11 million and $25 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.  
Return on Invested Capital   
ROIC is presented below and represents a non -GAAP measure. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because 
it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. 
ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long -term incentive compensation.  
The closest U.S. GA AP measure to ROIC is Return on Assets ( “ROA”) and is also presented below. ROA is calculated 
as net income attributable to Foot Locker, Inc. in the fiscal year divided by the two -year average of total assets . ROA 
decreased to 4.3%  as compared with 11.8% i n the prior  year. This decrease reflected lower profits and higher average 
total assets  compared with 2021 . Our ROIC decreased to 9.2%  in 2022, as compared with 16.4%  in the prior  year. The 
overall decrease in ROIC reflected a decrease in adjusted return a fter taxes, as well as higher average invested capital , 
primarily related to higher inventory levels in 2022 .

 Segment Reporting  and Results of Operations  
Our operating segments are identified according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated by our chief 
operating decision maker, our CEO. We have three operating segments, North America, Europe, Middle East, and 
Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific.   We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment 
based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.  
Sales  
Comparable -store sales is a key performance indicator for us . All references to comparable -store sales for a given 
period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period -end and had been open for more than one  year. The 
computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes direct -to-customers sales  as a result of our omnichannel 
strate gy. We view our e -commerce business as an extension of our physical stores. Stores opened or closed during 
the period are not included in the comparable -store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or 
remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.  
Sales from acquired businesses that include inventory are included in the computation of comparable -store sales after 
15 months of operations. Accordingly, sales of WSS were included effective January 2 023, while the sales from atmos 
continues to be excluded from the computation of comparable -store sales. Additionally, a s a result of the Eastbay Team 
Sales divestiture, sales from this business were removed for the computation of comparable sales for all periods .

 Comparable sales decreased by 1.9% as compared with the prior year. By operating segment , North America had a 
7.2% decrease , while EMEA and Asia Pacific generated increases of  14.5% and 16.0 %, respectively.  Comparable 
sales increased in our stores ; however , they  declined  in our direct -to-customer channel in 2022. Our sales in stores 
increased, driven by strong demand, brand  diversification efforts, and improved access to high -quality inventory. Our 
direct -to-customer channel continued to decrease  to more historical levels,  as shoppers navigated back to physical 
locations.  
For the combined channels, sales , excluding foreign currency fluctuations , decreased in North America by 6.6%, while 
EMEA increased by 17.5%, and Asia Pacific increased by 19. 5%, as compared with 2021. Our North American 
operating segment’s sales, while strong  in 2022 , no longer benefited from  the significant fiscal stimulus which 
contributed to growth  in 2021.  The effects of inflation negatively affected  customer demand. Additionally, the wind down 
of the Footaction  and Eastbay  business es negatively affected sales. Within EMEA, sales for the Foot Locker and 
Sidestep banner s increased  with the return of in -store traffic . Asia Pacific,  excluding atmos, generated increases in all 
of the geographies in which it operates, led by our operations in Australia . 
From a product perspective for the combined channels, the sales decrease in 2022 was across footwear and apparel , 
offset by a small increase in accessories. Footwear sales decreased mainly across the men’s and kids’ segments, while 
women’s increased. Similarly, apparel sales decreased for men’s  and kids’, while women’s increased  slightly .

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, freight, 
distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. 
Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges  and other fixed non -lease 
components) , real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.  
The gross margin rate decreased in 2022 by 250 basis points as compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower 
merchandise margin rate due to  higher markdowns versus historically -low levels last year. The occupancy rate 
deleverage reflected the effect of pr ior year rent abatements related to COVID -19. Excluding the benefit from the prior 
year abatement, the rate would have decreased by 10 basis points despite the decline in sales.

SG&A increased by $52 million, or 2.8%, in 2022, as compared with the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the SG&A 
rate increased by 110 basis points as compared with 2021. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A 
increased by $121 million, or 6.5%, as compared with th e prior year. Our newly acquired businesses contributed 
$104 million to SG&A, as the prior year represented a partial year . 
The increase in SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was driven by higher labor costs, information technology and support 
expenses, and C OVID -19 related matters in the prior year. SG&A in 2022 included nominal payroll subsidies from local 
governments, compared with $16 million in 2021.

Depreciation and amortization increased by $11 million as compared with the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign 
currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization increased by $17 million primarily due to the additions of WSS and 
atmos.  
Operating Results  
Division profit was $832 million, or 9.5% of sales in 2022. This compares with $1,161 million, or 13.0% of sales, for the 
prior year. The decrease was driven by both sales  channels experiencing declines in gross margin and deleveraging 
expenses . Our newly acquired businesses contributed $ 45 million to division profit , as the prior year represented a 
partial period . 
Impairment and Other  
During the fourth quarter of 202 2, we conducted an impairment review for approximately  142 underperforming stores , 
includin g 70 Sidestep stores due to the announced closure of the banner . We evaluated the long -lived assets, including 
the right -of-use assets and recorded non -cash charges of  $53 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold 
improvements, and right -of-use asset s for approximately  110 of these stores , which included $17 million for Sidestep 
stores . During the first and second quarters of 2022 we recorded impairment charges of $5 million related to long -lived 
assets and right -of-use assets, as well as accelerated tenancy charges.   
During 2022, we incurred $42 million of transformation consulting expense. Additionally, w e incurred $22 million of 
reorganization costs, primarily severance, due to the reduction of support functions as we streamlined the organization 
for operational efficiency and included $4 million of other costs related to  the wind down of the Sidestep banner . We 
also recorded $8 million of intangible asset impairment on the Sidestep tradename, due to the store and website 
closures. Dur ing the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a $9 million charge for litigation costs, as well as a benefit of 
$31 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of atmos. During 
2022 and 2021 we recorded acquisition and integration costs of $4 million and $24 million, respectively, which primarily 
represented investment banking and integration consulting fees related to the WSS and atmos acquisitions.  
During 2021, we conducted impairment reviews of Footac tion stores and underperforming stores and we recorded 
charges totaling $92  million. to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right -of-use assets. We also 
recorded $4 million of reorganization expense related to Footaction and certain supp ort functions. and non-cash 
charges of $42 million  related  to the write -down of certain minority investments. Additionally,  we recorded $15 million 
of lease termination costs related to the closure of certain stores and $2 million of intangible asset impai rment on the 
Footaction tradename, due to the store and website closures.

programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization 
included in corporate expense was $ 39 million and $34 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Excluding the changes 
in depreciation and amortiz ation, corporate expense increased primarily due to higher information technology and 
support expenses.

We recorded net interest expense of $ 15 million in 2022 , compared to $14 million  in 2021. Interest expense increased 
primarily due to the issuance of the 4% Notes , partially offset by interest income from our cross -currency swap and 
higher interest rates earned on our  cash and cash equivalents.

security, our share of earnings or losses r elated to our equity method investments, and net benefit (expense) related to 
our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component.  
During 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retai lors, Ltd., which is 
traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment was at a discount to the initial public offering price, resulting in 
a non -cash gain of $9 million  in 2021 . Additionally, c hanges in fair value generated non -cash gains of $ 68 million during 
2021 . A loss of $62 million was recorded during 2022, partially offset by $1 million of dividend income. This investment 
was sold during 2022 generating proceeds of $83 million. Our minority investment in GOAT is  accounted for using the 
fair val ue measurement alternative, which is at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment . GOAT  
received funding at higher valuations in both 2021 and 2020 resulting in non -cash gains of $290 million and $190  million,  
respectively . As of January 2 8, 202 3, the fair value of our investment in GOAT totaled $61 2 million.  
The losses  in 2022  were offset by a gain of $19 million from the divestiture of Eastbay Team Sales.

Effective tax rate     34.3 %      28.1 %    34.5 % 
 
Our effective tax rate for 202 2 was 34.3%, as compared with 28.1% in 202 1. The increase was primarily due to 
significantly lower  pretax income earned in the United States increasing  the effect of nondeductible expenses on the 
effective tax rate. Additionally, w e recorded a $11 million tax charge in 2021 related to the revaluation of ce rtain 
intellectual property rights pursuant to a non -U.S. advance pricing agreement. During 2020, a $25 million tax charge 
was recognized in connection with the revaluation. Additionally, during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we 
recorded tax benefit s of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, in connection with tax law changes in the Netherlands.   
We regularly assess the adequacy of provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable 
authoritative guidance on accounting for inc ome taxes. As a result, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be 
adjusted due to new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from 
taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses o f statutes of limitations. During  2022, we recorded a 
$5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the resolution of a foreign tax settlement. Partially offsetting 
this charge were tax benefits totaling $ 3 million from reserves releases due to various statute of limitation lapses. The 
changes in the tax reserves were not significant in 2021 and 2020.   
During 2022, we  recorded a tax expense of $6 million in connection with Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, including the 
effect of a non -deductibl e goodwill write -off.  
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 into law. The IRA contains a 
number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on 
corpor ate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not currently expect the IRA tax 
provisions will have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
Liquidity  
Our primary source of liquid ity has been cash flow from operations , while the principal uses of cash have been  to fund 
inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store 
remodelings, internet  and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities ; quarterly dividend payments ; 
and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short -term and long -term 
operating strategies. We generally finance  real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, 
future cash flow from operations , and amounts available under our credit agreement  will be adequate to fund these 
requirements.   
We may also repurchase our common stock through open  market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or 
otherwise. Such repurchases if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual 
restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. On February  24, 2022, the Board of Directors 
approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of its common stock 
replacing the prior authorization. The new share repurchase program does not have an expiration date  and as o f 
January 28, 2023, approximately $1.1 billion remained available . 
On February  15, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on 
April 28, 2023.  
Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance 
of our merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our 
reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchas es and risks associated with global 
product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations , as well as other factors listed 
under the heading “Disclosure Regarding Forward -Looking Statements,” could affect our ability to cont inue to fund our 
liquidity needs from business operations.  
Maintaining access to merchandise that we consider appropriate for our business may be subject to the policies and 
practices of our key suppliers. Therefore, we believe that it is critical to conti nue to maintain satisfactory relationships 
with these key suppliers . We purchased 86% and 87% of our merchandise from our top five suppliers in 2022 and 
2021, respectively. Approximately 65% and 68% was purchased from one supplier, Nike,  Inc., in 2022 and 2021, 
respectively.  
Planned capital expenditures in 2023 are $275  million. Included in the planned amount is $210  million dedicated to real 
estate projects designed to elevate our customers’ in -store experience. The real estate total includes the remodeling or 
expansion of approximately 170 existing stores, as well as th e planned opening of approximately 100 new stores, 
primarily representing the continued expansion of our off -mall community -based and “power” store formats, which 
provide pinnacle retail experiences that deliver connected customer interactions through serv ice, experience, product, 
and a sense of community. The real estate total includes continued expansion in North America , EMEA and funding for  
approximately  25 WSS new stores. Finally, the capital plan for 202 3 also includes $65 million primarily for digita l and 
supply chain initiatives. We also expect to spend an additional $30 million in software -as-a-service contracts related to  
our technology initiatives . We have the ability to revise and reschedule some of the anticipated spending  program 
should our fin ancial position require it.

offset by  higher capital expenditures in the current year. Spending for acquisitions in the current year related to WSS 
of $2 million and $14 million for atmos as certain post -closing conditions were satisfied, as compared with total spending 
of $1,056 million in 2 021. 
Capital expenditures in 2022 increased to $285 million from $209 million in the prior  year. During 2022, we completed 
the remodeling or relocation of 115 existing stores, the build -out of 103 new stores, and made progress on the 
development of informa tion systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives .  
During 2022, w e sold our investment in a public entity (Retailors , Ltd.) generating cash of $83 million  and dissolved a  
joint venture for proceeds of $ 12 million. Also during the second quarter of 2022, we sold our Eastbay Team Sales 
business receiving proceeds of $47 million.  We have invested $5 million in minority investments during the current year, 
including various limited partner venture capital funds managed by Black fun d managers, who are committed to 
advancing diverse -led businesses as part of our Leading in Education and Economic Development (LEED) initiative.

Total returned to shareholders   $  279  $  449  $  110 
Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to the prior year sale of $400 million aggregate principal 
amount of our 4% Senior Notes due 2029, partially offset by the $98 million repayment of principal related to the 8.5% 
debentures.  
During 2022, we repurchased 4,050,000 shares of common stock for $129 million under our share repurchase 
programs, whereas in the prior year we spent $348 million to repurchase shares. We also declared and paid 
$150  million in dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.40 per share i n 2022, as compared with $101 million in 
dividends in 2021.   
Free Cash Flow (non -GAAP measure)  
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and 
as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided 
by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation  
of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from 
underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under 
U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for  income or cash flow data prepared in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be 
inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.  The following table presents a 
reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial 
measure, to free cash flow.

 Capital Structure  
We maintain a credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. We currently have a $600  million asset -
based revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire  on July 14, 2025. No borrowings were outstanding as of 
January 28, 2023. Th e amount of borrowing under our credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby and 
commercial letters of credit outstanding, which are not significant.  
Credit Rating  
As of March 27, 2023, our corporate  credit ratings from Standard  & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are BB+ and 
Ba1, respectively. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service has rated our senior unsecured notes Ba2.  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
We have not entered into any transactions wi th unconsolidated entities that expose us to material continuing risks, 
contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. Also, our financial 
policies prohibit the use of derivatives for which there is n o underlying exposure.  
Critical Accounting Policies  
Our responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements requires 
application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, our accounting policies and methods are those specifically 
required by U.S.  GAAP . Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item  8. Consolidated 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is a summary of the most significant accounting policies. In some 
cases, we are required to calculate amounts based  on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe 
the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.  
Business Combinations  
We account for business combinations using the acquisition m ethod of accounting, which requires that once control is 
obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a 
liability.  We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible , intangible assets , and contingent 
consideration  based, in part, upon internal estimates of cash flows and considering the report of a  third-party valuation 
expert retained to assist the Company and requires a significant amount of management judgment. The determination 
of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as contingent consideration  requires estimates and the us e of 
valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination, we typically determine the fair value based on the discounted cash flow model, specifically the relief from 
royalty method for i ntangible assets related to a tradename. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets  
and contingent consideration  include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, 
customer attrition rates, discount rates and useful lives.  Changes to the assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
could affect the recorded amounts of the asset s acquired and the resultant goodwill, as well as the depreciation and 
amortization expense recorded in future periods.  
Impairment  of Long -Lived Tangible Assets and Right -of-Use Assets  
We perform an impairment review when circumstances indicate that the ca rrying value of long -lived tangible assets  
and right -of-use assets  may not be recoverable  (“a triggering event ”). Our policy for determining whether a triggering 
event  exists comprises the evaluation of measurable operating performance criteria and qualita tive measures at the  
lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities , which 
is generally at the store level . We also evaluate for triggering events at the banner level. If an impairment r eview  is 
necessitated by the identification  of a triggering event, we determine the fair value of the asset using  assumptions 
predominately identified from our historical performance and our long-range strategic plans.  
To determine if an impairment exists , we compare the carrying amount of the asset with the  estimated future 
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  group . If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds 
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, w e measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying 
amount of the asset  group  with its estimated fair value.  
The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows using a  risk adjusted discount rate 
and by using a  market approach to determine current lease rates. Future expected cash flows are based upon estimates 
that, if not achieved, may result in significantly different results .  
2022 Form 10 -K Page 29 
 Recoverability  of Goodwill and Indefinite -Lived Intangible Assets  
 
We review goodwill and indefinite -lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each 
fiscal  year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. For more information on the change in our annual 
impairment testing date, see  the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item  8. Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data.”  The review of impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to 
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values 
or a one -step qualitative impairment test.  
 
In perfor ming the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill 
may not be recoverable, including declines in our stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of 
the Company and macroeco nomic conditions affecting retail. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it 
is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, addition al 
quantitative impairment testing is  performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit 
be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwi ll 
impairment charge will be recorded for  the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).  
 
We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of discounted 
cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the report ing units requires significant estimates and 
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal 
growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts . Due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate the merits 
of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the r eporting 
units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units.  
Owned trademarks and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
but are reviewed at leas t annually for potential impairment. Our impairment evaluation for indefinite -lived intangible 
assets consists of either a qualitative or quantitative assessment, similar to the process for goodwill.  
If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate th at it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived 
intangible is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to proceed directly to a quantitative assessment, we calculate 
the fair value using a discounted cash flow method, based o n the relief -from-royalty concept, and compare the fair value 
to the carrying value to determine if the asset is impaired. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third 
party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is 
dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of 
intellectual property, discount rates, and other variables. We base our fair value estim ates on assumptions we believe 
to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those 
estimates. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than  the 
carrying value.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors  
Foot Locker, Inc.:  
 
Opinion on the  Consolidated Financial Statements  
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  of Foot Locker, Inc.  and subsidiaries (the Company) 
as of January  28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive 
income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three -year period ended 
January  28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).  In our opinion, the 
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 
Janua ry 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the 
three -year period ended January  28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
 
We also have audited, in accord ance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January  28, 2023, based on  criteria 
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 ) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March  27, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAO B and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance wi th the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits includ ed performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evide nce regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
conso lidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 
Critical Audit Matter  
 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates 
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially 
challenging, subjec tive, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way 
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical 
audit matter below, providing a separat e opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
it relates.  
 
Fair value of asset group related to certain underperforming stores  
 
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an impairment review 
when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long -lived tangible assets and right -of-use assets may not be 
recoverable. The long -lived tangible assets and the ri ght-of-use assets of the Company as of January  28, 2023 were 
$920 million and $2,443 million, respectively. If a triggering event is identified, the Company compares the carrying 
amount of the asset group with the estimated future cash flows expected to re sult from the use of the asset group. If 
the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures 
the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated f air value.  
 
2022 Form 10 -K Page 31 
 The estimation of fair value of the asset group is measured by discounting expected future cash flows using a risk -
adjusted discount rate and current market -based information for right -of-use assets. During the year ended 
January  28, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges of $53 million related to certain underperforming stores.  
 
We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the asset group related to certain underperforming stores as a critical 
audit matter. The market -based assumpti ons used to estimate the fair value of the asset group included market rent 
estimates for comparable stores that required a high degree of auditor judgment to evaluate and were challenging to 
test in the current economic environment. Changes in the selecti on of the market rent estimates could have had a 
significant effect on the determination of the fair value of the asset group, which impacted the measurement and 
allocation of the impairment loss within the asset group.  
 
The following are the primary proce dures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design 
and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s long -lived tangible asset and 
right-of-use asset impairment assessment process, includi ng a control related to the estimate of the fair value of the 
asset group. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in (1) evaluating 
the market rent estimates by assessing comparable retail leasing activity a pplicable to each location, and (2) assessing 
historic leasing activity of the Company in relation to historical store sales performance.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Basis of Presentation  
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Foot Locker,  Inc. and its domestic and international 
subsidiaries, as well as any entities in which we have a controlling voting interest th at are required to be consolidated. 
All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. As used in these Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements the terms “Foot Locker,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker,  Inc. and its consolid ated 
subsidiaries.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure 
of con tingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period 
presentation. Effective in 2022, we separately present licensing revenue in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations as a component of total revenue. Previously, licensing revenue was presented within other inco me / 
(expense), net.  
Reporting  Year  
Our fiscal  year end is a 52 -week or 53 -week period ending the Saturday closest to the last day in January. Fiscal  year 
2022, 2021, and 2020 represented the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023, January  29, 2022, and February  1, 2020, 
respectively. References to  years in this annual report relate to fiscal  years rather than calendar  years.  
Revenue Recognition  
Store revenue is recognized at the point of sale and includes merchandise, net of returns, and excludes taxes. 
Revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer receives the product, rather than when the initial 
deposit is paid. W e recognize revenue for merchandise that is shipped to our customers from our distribution centers 
and stores upon shipment as the custo mer has control of the product upon shipment. We account for shipping and 
handling as a fulfillment activity. We accrue the cost and recognize revenue for these activities upon shipment date, 
therefore total sales recognized includes shipping and handling fees. We have license agreements with unaffiliated 
third-party operators located in the Middle East and Asia. The agreements are largely structured with royalty income 
paid as a percentage of sales for the use of our trademarks, trade name and branding. We  record licensing revenue 
based upon sales estimates for the current period from the third -party operators.  
Gift Cards  
We sell gift cards which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift cards 
are redeemed by customers. Gift card breakage is recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights 
exercised by the customer, unl ess there is a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant 
jurisdictions.  
Advertising Costs and Sales Promotion  
Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed at the time the advertising or promotion takes place, net o f 
reimbursements for cooperative advertising. Cooperative advertising reimbursements earned for the launch and 
promotion of certain products agreed upon with vendors are recorded in the same period as the associated expenses 
are incurred.  
Digital advertisi ng costs are expensed as incurred, net of reimbursements for cooperative advertising. Digital 
advertising includes search engine marketing, such as display ads and keyword search terms, and other various 
forms of digital advertising. Reimbursements receive d in excess of expenses incurred related to specific, incremental, 
and identifiable  advertising costs are accounted for as a reduction to the cost of merchandise and are reflected in 
cost of sales when the merchandise is sold.

Cooperative advertising reimbursements      (37)     (29)     (14) 
Net advertising expense   $  185  $  194  $  144 
 
Share -Based Compensation  
We recognize compensation expense for share -based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards. 
We use the Black -Scholes option -pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires the input 
of subjective assumptions rega rding the expected term, expected volatility, and risk -free interest rate. See Note  22, 
Share -Based Compensation,  for information on the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock options. 
Share -based compensation expense is recognized on a stra ight-line basis over the requisite service period for each 
vesting tranche of the award. Upon exercise of stock options, issuance of restricted stock or units, or issuance of 
shares under the employee stock purchase plan, we will issue authorized but uniss ued common stock or use common 
stock held in treasury.  
Awards of restricted stock units cliff vest after the passage of time, generally three years . Performance stock unit 
awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with  the relevant performance period 
and vest after an additional one -year period.  
PSU awards granted in 2022 also include a performance objective based on our relative total shareholder return over 
the performance period to a pre -determined peer group, assum ing the reinvestment of dividends. The fair value of 
these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant and share -based compensation 
expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual awards.   
Earning s Per Share  
We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net 
income for the period by the weighted -average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. 
Diluted EPS reflects the weighted -average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic 
EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents.  
The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Performance stock units related to our long -term incentive programs of 0.4 million for 2022, 0.4 million for 2021, and 
0.4 million for 2020, have been excluded from diluted weighted -average shares. The issuance of these shares are 
contingent on our performance metrics as compared to the pre -established performance goals, which have not been 
achieved.  
Cash, Cash Equivalents, a nd Restricted Cash  
Cash consists of funds held on hand and in bank accounts. Cash equivalents include amounts on demand with banks 
and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  months or less, including money market funds. 
Additionally, amounts due from third -party credit card processors for the settlement of debit and credit card 
transactions are included as cash equivalents as they are generally collected within three business  days. We present 
book overdrafts, representing checks issued but still outstanding in excess of bank balances, as part of accounts 
payable.  
Restricted cash represents cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or  use under the terms of various agreements. 
Restricted cash includes amounts held in escrow in connection with various leasing arrangements in Europe, and 
deposits held in insurance trusts to satisfy the requirement to collateralize part of the self -insure d workers’ 
compensation and liability claims.   
The following table provides the reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as reported on our 
consolidated statements of cash flows:

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales  
Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, except for WSS 
and atmos. Cost is determined on the last -in, first -out (“LIFO”) basis for domestic inventories and on the first -in, first -
out (“FIFO”) basi s for international inventories. Merchandise inventories for our WSS and atmos businesses are 
valued at its net realizable value using the weighted average method. Cost is determined on the FIFO basis.  
The retail inventory method is used by retail companie s to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due 
to its practicality. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a cost -to-retail  percentage across 
groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost -to-retail  percentage is applied to ending inventory at its 
current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. We provide reserves 
based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market.  
Transp ortation, distribution center, and sourcing costs are capitalized in merchandise inventories. We expense the 
freight associated with transfers between our store locations in the period incurred. We maintain an accrual for 
shrinkage based on historical rate s. 
Cost of sales is comprised of the cost of merchandise, as well as occupancy, buyers’ compensation, and shipping 
and handling costs. The cost of merchandise is recorded net of amounts received from suppliers for damaged product 
returns, markdown allowanc es, and volume rebates, as well as cooperative advertising reimbursements received in 
excess of specific, incremental advertising expenses.  
Minority Investments  
We use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise s ignificant influence 
over the investee’s operating and financial policies, or in which we hold a partnership or limited liability company 
interest in an entity with specific ownership accounts, unless we have virtually no influence over the investee’s 
operating and financial policies. As of January  28, 2023 and January  29, 2022, we had $51 million and $56 million, 
respectively, of investments which are accounted for under the equity method.  
Our investments that are not accounted for under the equity method  are measured either at cost, adjusted for changes 
in observable prices minus impairment under the practicability exception, or at fair value for our investment in the 
common stock of an entity that is publicly traded. As of January  28, 2023 and January  29, 2022, we had $579  million 
and $725  million, respectively, of investments which are accounted for under these methods.  
Property and Equipment  
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additio ns 
and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. Major renewals or replacements that substantially 
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  
Depreciation and amortization are comput ed on a straight -line basis over the following estimated useful lives:  
   
   
Buildings       Maximum of 50 years  
Store leasehold improvements   Shorter of the asset useful life or expected term of the lease  
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment   3‑10 years  
Software   2‑5 years

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
Internal -Use Software Development Costs  
We capitalize certain external and internal computer software and software development costs incurred during the 
application development stage. The application development stage generally includes software design and 
configuration, coding, testing, and ins tallation activities. Capitalized costs include only external direct cost of materials 
and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal -use software, and payroll and payroll -related costs for 
employees who are directly associated with and devote t ime to the internal -use software project. Capitalization of 
such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended 
use. We generally amortize these costs on a straight -line basis over a period no t to exceed  five years. Training and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that 
such expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software, net of accumulated amor tization, is 
included as a component of Property and equipment, net and was $87 million and $103  million at January  28, 2023 
and January 29, 2022, respectively.  
Cloud computing arrangements (software -as-a-service contracts) and related implementation costs  that are 
capitalized are amortized on a straight -line basis over the contract term. These amounts are classified with prepaid 
expense and other long -term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Expense related to cloud computing 
arrangements are includ ed in SG&A. The corresponding cash flows related to these arrangements are included in 
“Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
Impairment of Long -Lived Tangible Assets and Right -of-Use Assets  
We p erform an impairment review when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long -lived tangible assets 
and right -of-use assets may not be recoverable (“a triggering event”). Our policy in determining whether a triggering 
event exists comprises the e valuation of measurable operating performance criteria and qualitative measures at the 
lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows for other assets and liabilities, 
which is generally at the store level. We also eva luate triggering events at the banner level. In evaluating potential 
store level impairment, we compare future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
group to the carrying amount of the asset group. The future cash flows are e stimated predominately based on our 
historical performance and long -range strategic plans. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the 
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying 
amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting 
expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate and using current market -based information for right -
of-use assets. We estimate fai r value based on the best information available using estimates, judgments, and 
projections as considered necessary.  
Leases  
Lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the 
lease term for those  arrangements where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its 
use. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate a lease only when we are reasonably certain that we will 
exercise that option. The right -of-use a sset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease 
payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs, and any tenant improvement 
allowances received. For operating leases, right -of-use assets are red uced over the lease term by the straight -line 
lease expense recognized less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest 
method.  
We combine lease components and non -lease components. Given our policy election to combine lease and non -
lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease 
payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included  in our lease liability. We recognize rent expense for operating leases 
as of the possession date for store leases or the commencement of the agreement for non -store leases. Rental 
expense, inclusive of rent holidays, concessions, and tenant allowances are  recognized over the lease term on a 
straight -line basis. Contingent payments based upon sales and future increases determined by inflation related 
indices cannot be estimated at the inception of the lease and, accordingly, are charged to operations as 
incurred.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the 
remaining lease term to determine the present value of future lease payme nts. Our incremental borrowing rate for a 
lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease 
payments under similar terms.   
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded o n the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense 
for short -term leases on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually during the first quarter of 
each fiscal  year historically, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we 
voluntarily change d our annual goodwill testing date from the first day of the fiscal year to the first day of our fourth 
quarter. The Company believes this change in method of applying the accounting principle is preferable, as it better 
aligns the annual impairment testin g date with the most current information from the budgeting and strategic planning 
process and provides management with sufficient time to complete its annual assessment in advance of our year -
end reporting. The change did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a n impairment charge.  
The review of goodwill impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more 
likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one -step quantitati ve 
impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the 
carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in our stock price and market capitalization in 
relation to the book valu e of the Company and macroeconomic conditions affecting retail. If, based on the results of 
the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit 
exceeds its carrying value, additional quant itative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that 
the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting 
unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairmen t charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying 
value of goodwill).  
We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of 
discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and li abilities within the reporting units requires significant 
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount 
rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and cap ital expenditures forecasts. Due 
to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We 
evaluate the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determ ine the fair 
value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting 
units.  
For our annual impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, we concluded the fair value of each 
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $167  million for all 
periods presented. Refer to Note 2 for further detail regarding acquisitions made during 2021.  
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are te sted for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, 
annually. The impairment review for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of either performing a qualitative 
or a quantitative assessment. If the results of the qualitative as sessment indicate that it is more likely than not that 
the fair value of the indefinite -lived intangible is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to proceed directly to a 
quantitative assessment, we calculate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief from 
royalty method, and compare the fair value to the carrying value to determine if the asset is impaired. Intangible 
assets that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment 
only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
Contingent Consideration  
As a result of our purchase of atmos, we recognized continge nt consideration, as a component of the purchase 
consideration is payable contingent on the achievement of certain sales and EBITDA performance. See Note 2 for 
further details. Contingent consideration is classified as a liability when it will be settled i n cash or a variable number 
of shares (or a combination thereof), and the amount of the payment is not dependent upon the fair value of the 
Company’s common stock. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is estimated using an option pricin g 
model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations. This technique 
determines projected payments based on simulated sales and EBITDA derived from an internal forecast, adjusted 
for selected revenue and EBITDA v olatilities and risk premiums based on market data for comparable guideline public 
companies. The projected payments are then discounted back to the valuation date at the Company’s cost of debt 
using a term commensurate with the contractual payment dates.  
The contingent consideration liability will be measured at fair value on a recurring basis until the contingency is 
resolved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability will be reflected in operating 
income or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
Derivative Financial Instruments  
All derivative financial instruments are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. For 
derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as part of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income/loss or as a 
basis adjustment to the underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the perio d in which the hedged item 
affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally not 
reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed of. To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not 
designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in earnings immediately, which may 
subject us to increased earnings volatility.  
Income Taxes  
We account for our income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial 
statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of th e differences 
between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for 
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credits and net 
operatin g loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not 
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred 
tax assets and liabilitie s is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  
We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. 
In making such a determination, we consider all available pos itive and negative evidence, including future reversals 
of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax -planning strategies, and results of 
recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax  assets in the future in excess of 
their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would 
reduce the provision for income taxes.  
A taxing authority may challenge positions that we adopted in our i ncome tax filings. Accordingly, we may apply 
different tax treatments for transactions in filing our income tax returns than for income tax financial reporting. We 
regularly assess our tax positions for such transactions and record reserves for those diffe rences when considered 
necessary. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the 
positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more -likely -than-not threshold are 
measured u sing a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty  percent 
likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more -likely -than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax 
position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of 
all available evidence. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax 
expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included 
within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
Pension and Postretirement Obligations  
Pension benefit obligations an d net periodic pension costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions. Two key 
assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return 
on plan assets. The discount rate for the U.S. plans is d etermined by reference to the Bond:Link interest rate model 
based upon a portfolio of highly -rated U.S. corporate bonds with individual bonds that are theoretically purchased to 
settle the plan’s anticipated cash outflows. The cash flows are discounted to their present value and an overall 
discount rate is determined. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Canadian benefit 
obligations was developed by using that plan’s bond portfolio indices, which match the benefit obligations. We 
measure our plan assets and benefit obligations using the  month -end date that is closest to our fiscal  year end. The 
expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension 
plan assets and consider ing historical as well as expected performance of those assets.   
Insurance Liabilities  
We are primarily self -insured for health care, workers’ compensation, and general liability costs. Accordingly, 
provisions are made for actuarially determined estimates of discounted future claim costs for such risks, for the 
aggregate of claims reported, and claims incurred but not yet reported. Self -insured liabilities totaled $13 million for 
January 28, 2023, $14 million for January 29, 2022 and $13 million for January  30, 2021. Workers’ compensation 
and general liability reserves are discounted using a risk -free interest rate. Imputed interest expense related to these 
liabilities was not significant for any of the periods presented.  
Treasury Stock Retirement  
We periodi cally retire treasury shares that we acquire through share repurchases and return those shares to the 
status of authorized but unissued. We account for treasury stock transactions under the cost method. For each 
reacquisition of common stock, the number of  shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the 
existing treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, our policy is to allocate the excess of 
the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both r etained earnings and additional paid -in capital. 
The portion allocated to additional paid -in capital is determined by applying a percentage, which is determined by 
dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued, to the balance o f additional paid -in capital 
as of the retirement date.  
We retired 6,019,212  and 5,474,288  shares of our common stock held in treasury during 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
The shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued. As a result, treasury stock decreased by 
$213  million and $260  million as of January 28, 2023 and January 29 , 2022, respectively.  
Foreign Currency Translation  
The functional currency of our international operations is the applicable local currency. The translation of the 
applicable foreign currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates 
in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted -average rates of 
exchange prevailing during the  year. The unearned gains and losses resulting from such translation are included as 
a separat e component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) within shareholders’ equity.  
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect 
on our pres ent or future consolidated financial statements.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
All recently issued accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements.

2. Acquisitions  
WSS  
In 2021, the Company, through its wholly -owned subsidiary Foot Locker Retail, Inc., acquired 100%  of the shares of 
Eurostar, Inc., a Delaware corporation operating as WSS (“WSS”). WSS is a U.S. -based off -mall athletic footwear 
and apparel retailer, focused  on the Hispanic consumer, which operated 93 stores at the acquisition, primarily on the 
West Coast.  
We believe that this acquisition enhances our growth opportunities in North America and creates further diversification 
and differentiation in terms of bo th customers and products.  
The results of WSS are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The proforma 
effects of the acquisition have not been presented, as their effects were not significant to the consolidated resu lts of 
operations.  
The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $809  million ( $2 million paid in 2022 and $737  million paid in 
2021, net of cash acquired) and was funded with available cash. During 2022, we recorded insignificant changes to 
the val ue of net assets acquired related to income tax balances.  
The following table represents the final allocation of the purchase price for WSS. We determined that the WSS 
tradename will have an indefinite life and will not be amortized. The excess purchase pr ice over the fair value of 
assets was allocated to goodwill.

atmos  
Effective November 1, 2021, the Company, acquired certain entities collectively operated as atmos, headquartered 
in Japan. atmos is a digitally led, culturally -connected global brand featuring premium sneakers and apparel, an 
exclusive in -house label , collaborative relationships with leading vendors in the sneaker ecosystem, experiential 
stores, and a robust omni -channel platform.  
The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $372  million ( $12 million paid in 2022 and $319  million paid in 
2021, net of cash acquired) subject to adjustment for the finalization of the purchase price. At closing, we placed 
$20 million related to certain indemnifications and this indemnification escrow will be relea sed in May 2023, unless 
there is a pending claim. The acquisition was funded with available cash.

2. Acquisitions (continued)  
The purchase price includes contingent consideration which can reach up to $111  million based on achieving certain 
revenue growt h and EBITDA performance targets. The contingent consideration was initially valued at $35 million in 
2021 and during 2022 that amount was reduced to $4 million, through impairment and other in our Consolidated 
Statement s of Operations.  
The results of atmo s are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The proforma 
effects of the acquisition have not been presented, as their effects were not significant to the consolidated results of 
operations.  
The table below summarizes  the final allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired for atmos 
using the exchange rate in effect as of the date of the acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of 
assets was  allocated to goodwill. Changes to am ounts reported in the prior year resulted in a change to goodwill of 
$7 million and primarily was related to intangibles. These adjustments did not have a significant effect on the 
consolidated results of operations. We determined that the atmos tradenames  will have an indefinite life and will not 
be amortized. Goodwill of $30 million is deductible for tax purposes over 15 years.

4. Segment Information (continued)  
Our operating segments are identified according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated by our 
chief operating decision maker, our CEO. We have three  operating segments, North America, EMEA (Europe, Midd le 
East and Africa), and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners 
in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Footaction, and WSS, 
including each of their re lated e -commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business that included internet, 
catalog, and team sales. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners in Europe: Foot 
Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of  their related e -commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific 
operating segment includes the results of Foot Locker in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia and atmos operating 
primarily in Japan, as well as their related e -commerce businesses. Additionally, the EMEA and Asia Pacific operating 
segments include licensing revenue. We further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment 
based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.  
We evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is the banner’s financial 
results referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other, 
corporate expense, interest expense, net and other income / (expens e), net.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we conducted an impairment review for approximately 142 underperforming stores, 
which included 70 Sidestep stores. The Company has made the strategic decision to shut down this banner during 
2023. We evaluated the long -lived assets, including the right -of-use assets and recorded non -cash charges 
of $53 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right -of-use assets for approximately 110 of 
these stores, which included $17 million for Sidestep stores. During the first and second quarters of 2022 we recorded 
impairment charges of $5 million related to long -lived assets and right -of-use assets, as well as accelerated tenancy 
charges.  
Impairment of long -lived assets and right of use assets recorded during  2021 related primarily to the decision to shut 
down our Footaction banner. The amounts in 2020 primarily represented impairment related to our stores operating 
in Europe, which had a triggering event caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. All periods reflect ch arges associated 
with our annual fourth quarter impairment review of underperforming stores.  
During 2022, we incurred $42 million of transformation consulting expense. Additionally, we incurred $22 million of 
reorganization costs, primarily severance, due to the reduction of support functions as we streamlined the 
organization for operational efficiency and included $4 million of other costs related to the wind down of the Sidestep 
banner. Associated with the decision to shut down the Sidestep banner, we re corded an $8 million intangible asset 
impairment on the Sidestep tradename.  
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a $9 million charge for litigation, representing a pending settlement of 
a wage/hour matter.  
In connection with the acquisition of atmos in the prior year, the purchase included contingent consideration based 
on the achievement of certain sales and EBITDA metrics. The fair value was initially measured as part of the purchase 
price as $35 million. As required, the adjustment of its fai r value was recorded through earnings and represents a 
benefit of $31 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.  
During 2022 and 2021 we recorded acquisition and integration costs of $4 million and $24 million, respectively, which 
primarily represente d investment banking and integration consulting fees related to the WSS and atmos acquisitions.  
Over the last several years we have made several minority investments in early -stage companies. In connection with 
these investments, we recorded non -cash charges of $42 million and $4 million, in 2021 and 2020 respectively, 
related  to the write -down of certain minority investments due to their underperformance.

During 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd., which 
is traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment was at a discount to the initial public offering price, resulting 
in a non -cash gain of $9 million  in 2021 . Additionally, c hanges in fair value related to  our Retailors, Ltd. investment 
generated non -cash gains of $68 million during 2021 . During 2022, we sold our position in this investment. A loss of 
$62 million was recorded during 2022, partially off set by $1 million of dividend income. Our minority investment in 
GOAT is  accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative, which is at cost adjusted for changes in 
observable prices minus impairment . GOAT  received funding at higher valuations in both 2021 and 2020 resulting in 
non-cash gains of $290  million and $190  million, respectively .  
During 2021 , we recorded  $7 million of insurance recoveries in excess of the losses sustained in the prior year related 
to the social unrest.

13. Revolving Credit Facility  
We have a  $600  million asset -based revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire  on July 14, 2025  (as 
amended, “2020 Credit Agreement”).  
In 2021, we entered into an amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”). The 
amendment provides for, among other things, (i) reducing the interest rates and commitment fees applicable to the 
loans and commitments, respectively, as described below, and (ii) reducing the “floor” applicable. The amend ment 
provides that the interest rate applicable to loans drawn under the credit facility will be equal to, at our option, either 
a base rate, determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.25%  to 0.75%  per annum, or a 
Eurodollar rate , determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.25%  to 1.75%  per annum, in each case, 
depending on availability under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we will pay a commitment fee of 0.25%  
per annum on the unused portion of the commitments  under the Amended Credit Agreement. No events of default 
occurred during 202 2. 
We may use the Amended  Credit Agreement to, among other things, support standby letters of credit in connection 
with insurance programs. The letters of credit outstanding as of  January  28, 2023  were not significant.  
The unamortized balance  of fees paid in connection with the credit facility  at January  28, 2023 was $3 million. Interest 
expense, including facility fees, related to the revolving credit facility was $3 million, $3 million, and $5 million for 
2022, 202 1, and 20 20, respectively.

components which are not fixed and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Variable 
lease costs also include amounts based on a percentag e of gross sales in excess of specified levels that are 
recognized when probable.

18. Income Taxes  (continued)  
Following the enactment of Public Law 115 -97 (“Tax Act”) and the one -time transition tax, our historical foreign 
earnings are not subject to additional U.S. federal tax upon repatriation. Further, no additional U.S. federal tax will be 
due upon repatriatio n of current foreign earnings because they are either exempt or subject to U.S. tax as earned.  
At January  28, 2023, we had accumulated undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $571  million. This amount 
consists of historical earnings that were previously taxed under the Tax Act and post -Tax Act earnings. Investments 
in our foreign subsidiaries, including working capital, will continue to be permanently reinvested. Cash balances in 
excess of working capital needs are considered to be available for repatriation to the United States and foreign 
withholding taxes will be accrued as necessary on these amounts.  
We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference between the f inancial statement carrying amount and 
the tax basis of our investments in foreign subsidiaries. The determination of any unrecorded deferred tax liability on

18. Income Taxes  (continued)  
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, which are based upon 
our long -range strategic plans, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of 
deductible differences, ne t of the valuation allowances, over the periods in which the temporary differences are 
anticipated to reverse. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the 
future if estimates of taxable income are revised.  
As of January  28, 2023, we have a valuation allowance of $93 million to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount 
that is more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance of $77 million was recorded against tax loss 
carryforwards of certain for eign entities. Based on the history of losses and the absence of prudent and feasible 
business plans for generating future taxable income in these entities, we believe it is more likely than not that the 
benefit of these loss carryforwards will not be real ized. As of January  28, 2023, a valuation allowance of $15 million 
was established for foreign taxes assessed at rates in excess of the U.S. federal tax rate for which no U.S. foreign  
tax credit is available. Additionally, since we do not have any reasonab ly foreseeable sources of Canadian capital 
gains, a valuation allowance of $1 million was established since 2019 for a deferred tax asset arising from a capital 
loss.  
At January  28, 2023, we have international minimum tax credit carryforwards with a poten tial tax benefit of $3 million 
and operating loss carryforwards with a potential tax benefit of $100  million, a portion of which will expire between 
2023  and 20 29 and a portion of which will never expire. We will have, when realized, a capital loss with a potential 
benefit of $1 million. The Canadian loss will carryforward indefinitely after realization. The international operating loss 
carryforwards include nominal unrecognized tax benefits. We also have foreign tax credit carrybacks and 
carryforwards with  a potential tax benefit of $19 million that will expire between 2023 and 203 2.  
We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit. Audits can involve complex issues that may 
require an extended period of time to resolve. A taxing authority may challenge positions that we have adopted in 
our income tax filings. Accor dingly, we may apply different tax treatments for transactions in filing the income tax 
returns than for income tax financial reporting. We regularly assess our tax positions for such transactions and record 
reserves for those differences.  We participa te in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process and the  examination of 
our 202 1 U.S. Federal income tax filing was concluded in February 2023 . To date, no adjustments have been 
proposed in any audits that will have a material effect on our financial position or r esults of operations.  
At January  28, 2023, we had $52 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $44 million would, if recognized, 
affect our annual effective tax rate. We classified certain income tax liabilities as current or noncurrent based o n 
management’s estimate of when these liabilities will be settled. Interest expense and penalties related to 
unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense . Interest expense recognized was $6 million in 2022 
and was not significant for any of the prior years presented .  
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:  
          
($ in millions)       2022       2021       2020  
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year   $  41  $  47  $  45

Lapse of statute of limitations      (4)     (5)     (5) 
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year   $  52  $  41  $  47 
It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease 
within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of foreign currency fluctuations, ongoing audits, or 
the expiration of statutes of limitations. Settlements dur ing 202 3 are not expected to be significant based on current 
estimates. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues, the ultim ate resolution could have an 
adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision 
would be reduced, generating a positive effect on earnings.

19. Financial Instruments and Risk Management  
We operate internationally and utilize certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate our foreign currency 
exposures, primarily related to third -party and intercompany forecasted transactions. As a result of the use of 
derivative instrumen ts, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To 
mitigate this counterparty credit risk, we have a practice of entering into contracts with major financial institutions 
selected based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. We monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties 
throughout the duration of the derivative instrument.  
Derivative Holdings Designated as Hedges  
The primary currencies to which we are exposed are the euro, British poun d, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar , and 
the Japanese Yen . Generally, merchandise inventories are purchased by each geographic area in their respective 
local currency with the exception of the United Kingdom, whose merchandise inventory purchases are pri marily 
denominated in euros.  
For option and foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of the purchase of inventory, the 
effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of AOCL and is recognized as a component of cos t 
of sales when the related inventory is sold. The amount reclassified to cost of sales related to such contracts was not 
significant for any of the periods presented. The effective portion of gains or losses associated with other forward 
contracts is defe rred as a component of AOCL until the underlying transaction is reported in earnings. The ineffective 
portion of gains and losses related to cash flow hedges recorded to earnings was not significant for any of the periods 
presented.  
On May 6, 2022, we ent ered into a cross -currency swap contract to reduce the effect of the fluctuating U.S. 
Dollar (“USD”) to Japanese Yen (“JPY”) foreign exchange rate on our foreign currency -denominated 
intercompany loan between our Japanese and U.S. subsidiary. We expect the  gains and losses on this contract 
to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from 
the remeasurement of the principal and interest accrued on the loan. Though the intercompany loan eliminat es 
in consolidation, the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan and interest by the U.S. subsidiary is reflected 
in the consolidated financial statements.  
The cross -currency swap contract has a notional amount of JPY 11 billion and final receipt of $85 million. The 
cross -currency swap contract, which matures on November 2, 2031, swaps Yen -denominated interest 
payments for U.S. dollar -denominated interest payments, thereby economically converting the JPY 11 billion 
fixed -rate 3.51%  intercompany loan to a  fixed -rate 6.77%  USD -denominated receivable for our U.S. subsidiary.  
We designated the cross -currency swap contract to hedge the changes in value of the intercompany loan and 
its variability on earnings. We apply fair value hedge accounting, and we consi der market factors other than the 
change in the spot exchange rate on the notional amount of the swap to be excluded components. The foreign 
currency spot rate fluctuations on the cross -currency swap notional amount and interest accruals are reported 
in ea rnings each period, while all other changes are reported in other comprehensive income. Because the 
terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument match and the likelihood of swap counterparty default is 
not probable, the hedge is expected to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the foreign currency debt 
resulting from to foreign currency fluctuations over the term of the swap.  
As of January 28, 2023, the cross -currency swap had a fair value of $3 million and was included in other 
liabilities. W e record the changes in the fair value of the contract to AOCL. Each period, we reclassify an amount 
out of AOCL equal to the remeasurement gain or loss on the hedged intercompany loan that is recorded in 
selling, general and administrative expenses. As of  January 28, 2023, there was $3 million in AOCL, net of tax, 
related to the cross -currency swap. In addition, we recognize swap interest income based on the differential in 
fixed interest rates per the contract. During  2022, we recorded $2 million of incom e in interest expense, net. 
Refer to Note 17 for further information regarding amounts recorded in AOCL.

19. Financial Instruments and Risk Management  (continued)  
Derivative Holdings Not Designated as Hedges  
We enter into certain derivative contracts th at are not designated as hedges, such as foreign exchange forward 
contracts and currency option contracts. These derivative contracts are used to manage certain costs of foreign 
currency -denominated merchandise purchases, intercompany transactions, and the  effect of fluctuating foreign 
exchange rates on the reporting of foreign currency -denominated earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
holdings not designated as hedges, as well as realized gains and premiums paid, are recorded in earnings 
immedi ately within SG&A or Other income, net, depending on the type of transaction. The aggregate amount 
recognized for these contracts was not significant for any of the periods presented.  
Fair Value of Derivative Contracts  
The following represents the fair va lue of our derivative contracts.

Business Risk  
The retail business is highly competitive. Price, quality, selection of merchandise, reputation, store location, 
advertising, and customer experience are important competitive factors in our business. We operate in 29 countries 
and purchased 86% of our mer chandise in 202 2 from our top 5 suppliers. In  2022, we purchased 65% of our athletic 
merchandise from one major supplier, Nike,  Inc. (“Nike”). Each of our banners are highly dependent on Nike; they 
individually purchased approximately 50% to 75% of their m erchandise from Nike.  
Included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 28, 2023, are the net assets of our European operations, 
which total $454  million and are located in 20 countries, 11 of which have adopted the euro as their functional 
currency.  
20. Fair Value Measurements  
We categorize our financial instruments into a three -level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation 
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest p riority to 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
(Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is  
based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  
Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs. Our financial assets 
recorded at fair value are categorized as follows:  
Level  1 -     Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  
Level  2 -     Observable inputs oth er than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not 
active; and model -derived valuations in which all significant input s or significant value -drivers are 
observable in active markets.  
Level  3 -     Model -derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value -drivers are 
unobservable.  
During 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minor ity stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd., which 
is traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment was classified as a Level 1 instrument since the fair value 
is readily available in an active market.  During 2022, we sold our holdings in this i nvestment.

20. Fair Value Measurements  (continued)  
Our auction rate security, classified as available -for-sale, is recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet and is recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in Other income , net in our Consolidated 
Statements of Operations.  The fair value of the auction rate security is determined by using quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.  
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the atmos acquisition is estimated using an 
option pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous iterations. 
See Note 1 for further detai ls.  
Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market -based inputs to valuation models. These valuation 
models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility 
and therefore are c lassified as Level 2 instruments .

There were no transfers  into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for any of the periods presented.  
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities recognized or 
disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as 
property, plant and equip ment, operating lease right -of-use assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority 
investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These assets are measured using 
Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired. The prefe rred stock of our m inority investment  in GOAT  is measured 
using the fair value measurement alternative had a carrying value of $579  million for both  January  28, 2023 and 
January  29, 2022 . As of January  28, 2023 , cumulative impairments on our portfolio of m inority investments were 
$53 million.  
Long -Term Debt  
The fair value of long -term debt is determined by using model -derived valuations in which all significant inputs or 
significant value -drivers are observable in active markets and therefore are classified  as Level 2.

21. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits  
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  
We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our North American employees. In May 2019, the U.S. 
qualified pension plan was amended such that all employees who were not participants in the plan as of 
Dece mber  31, 2019, will not become participants after such date. All benefit accruals were frozen as of 
December  31, 2019 for all plan participants with less than  eleven years  of service as of that date . For participants 
with more than  eleven years  of service as of December  31, 2019, benefit accruals were  frozen as of 
December  31, 2022. Participants will continue to accrue interest at a fixed rate of 6% per year.  
We also sponsor postretirement medical and life insurance plans, which are available to mo st of our retired U.S. 
employees. These plans are contributory and are not funded. These plans are not significant .  
The following tables set forth the plans’ changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, funded status, and amounts 
recognized in the Cons olidated Balance Sheets:

The Canadian qualified pension plan’s assets exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation for both 202 2 and 202 1. 
In 2021, the U.S. qualified pension plan’s assets exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation , however in 2022 the 
accumulated benefit obligation was greater than the plan’s assets . Our non -qualified pension plans have an 
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, as these plans are unfunded. Accordingly, the table below 
reflects the U.S. non -qualified plans for 2022 and 2021 and the U.S. qualified plan for 2022.

21. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits (continued)  
The following table provides the amounts recognized in AOCL on a pre -tax basis:  
    
   
($ in millions)        
Net actuarial loss at beginning of year   $  320 
Amortization of net loss      (10) 
Loss arising during the year      21 
Foreign currency fluctuations      (2) 
Net actuarial loss at end of year   $  329 
The actuarial losses  recognized during 202 2 were primarily driven lower actual return as compared with the expected 
return on plan assets  partially offset by a n increase in discount rates applied against future expected benefit 
payment s, which  resulted in a decrease in the benefit obligation for th e pension benefit plans.  
The following weighted -average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations under the plans:  
      
      2022       2021       
Discount rate     5.0 %    3.2 %   
Rate of compensation increase     3.6 %    3.6 %   
Pension expense is actuarially calculated annually based on data available at the beginning of each  year. The 
expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected long -term rate of return on assets by the 
market -related value of plan as sets for the U.S. qualified pension plan and market value for the Canadian qualified 
pension plan. The market -related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and 
losses in fair value related to equities over three  or five years , depending on which computation results in a market -
related value closer to market value. Market -related value for the U.S. qualified plan was $618  million and $652  million 
for 202 2 and 202 1, respectively.  
Assumptions used in the calculation of net benefit cost include the discount rate selected and disclosed at the end of 
the previous  year, as well as other assumptions detailed in the table below:  
        
      2022       2021       2020       
Discount rate     3.2 %    2.5 %    2.9 %   
Rate of compensation increase     3.6 %    3.6 %    3.6 %   
Expected long -term rate of return on assets     4.8 %    5.3 %    5.5 %   
 
The expected long -term rate of return on invested plan assets is based on the plans’ weighted -average target asset 
allocation, as well as historical and future expected performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is 
selected to obtain an investment return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce the 
variability of our future contributions.  
The following are the components of net periodic pension benefit cost.  Service cost is recognized as a component of 
SG&A  and the remaining pension and postretirement expense components are recognized as part of Other income, 
net.  
          
($ in millions)   2022       2021       2020

Amortization of net loss      10     10     12 
Net benefit expense   $  14  $  9  $  10 
The mortality assumption used to value the 202 2 and 2021  U.S. pension obligations was the Pri -2012 mortality table 
with generational projection using MP -2021 for both males and females. For years ended January  28, 2023 and 
January  29, 2022, we used the 2014 CPM Private Sector mortality table projected generatio nally with Scale CPM -B 
for both males and females to value its Canadian pension obligations

21. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits  (continued)  
Plan Assets  
The target composition of our U.S. qualified pension plan assets is 70% fixed -income securities, 28.5%  equities, and 
1.5%  real estate. We may alter the asset allocation targets from time to time depending on market conditions and the 
funding requirements o f the pension plan. This current asset allocation has and is expected to limit volatility with 
regard to the funded status of the plan, but may result in higher pension expense due to the lower long -term rate of 
return associated with fixed -income securiti es. Due to market conditions and other factors, actual asset allocations 
may vary from the target allocation outlined above.  The target composition of our Canadian qualified pension plan 
assets is 95% fixed -income securities and 5% equities. We believe pla n assets are invested in a conservative manner 
with the same overall objective and investment strategy as noted below for the U.S. pension plan. The bond portfolio 
is comprised of government and corporate bonds chosen to match the duration of the pension p lan’s benefit payment 
obligations. This current asset allocation will limit future volatility.  
We believe plan assets are invested in a conservative manner with an objective of providing a total return that, over 
the long term, provides sufficient assets to fund benefit obligations, taking into account our expected contributions 
and the level of fun ding risk deemed appropriate. Our investment strategy seeks to diversify assets among classes 
of investments with differing rates of return, volatility, and correlation in order to reduce funding risk. Diversification 
within asset classes is also utilized to ensure that there are no significant concentrations of risk in plan assets and to 
reduce the effect that the return on any single investment may have on the entire portfolio.  
Valuation of Investments  
Commingled trust funds are valued at the net asset va lue of units held by the plan at  year end. Stocks and mutual 
funds traded on U.S. and Canadian security exchanges are valued at closing market prices on the measurement 
date. Each category of U.S. and Canadian plan assets is classified within the same level of the fair value hierarchy 
for 2022 and 2021.  
The fair values of  the U.S. pension plan assets at January  28, 2023 and January  29, 2022 were as follows:

21. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits  (continued)  
Contributions and Expected Payments  
We were not required to make any contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 202 2 and 202 1. We do not 
anticipate making any contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 202 3 due to the strong funded status of the 
plan, however we continually evaluate the amount and timing of any potential contributions based on market 
conditions  and other factors.  We paid $3 million and $3 million in pension benefits related to our non -qualified pension 
plans during 2022 and 2021, respectively.  
Estimated future benefit payments for each of the next five  years and the five  years thereafter are as follows:  
    
($ in millions)

Savings Plans  
We have a 401(k)  plan that is available to employees whose primary place of employment is the U.S., and another 
plan that is available to employees whose primary place of employment is in Puerto Rico. With the acquisition of 
WSS in 2021, we became the sponsor of the 401(k) plan for WSS employees. The charge s for matching contributions 
were not significant for any of the periods presented . 
 
22. Share -Based Compensation  
Stock Awards  
Under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2007 Stock Plan”), stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, 
stock appreciation rights, or other share -based awards may be granted to nonemployee directors, offi cers and other 
employees, including our subsidiaries and operating divisions worldwide. Options for employees become exercisable 
in substantially equal annual installments over a three -year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of 
grant of the option, unless a shorter or longer duration is established at the time of the option grant.  The options 
terminate ten years  from the date of grant. On May  21, 2014, the 2007 Stock Plan was amended to increase the 
number of shares of common stock res erved for all awards to 14 million shares. As of January  28, 2023 , there were  
3,651,807  shares  available for issuance under this plan.   
On August 24, 2022, the Company granted options and other awards to its new President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Mary N. Dillon. These awards were granted outside of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan as employment inducement 
awards and do not require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise. 
Shares available for future grant under this plan of 545,660  are reserved for the sole purpose to issue shares pursuant 
to her employment inducement awards.  
Employees Stock Purchase Plan  
Under our 2013 Foot Locker Employees Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), participating employees are able to 
contribute up to 10% of their annual compensation, not to exceed $25,000  in any plan  year, through payroll 
deductions to acquire shares of our common sto ck at 85% of the lower market price on one of two specified dates in 
each plan  year. Of the 3,000,000  shares of common stock authorized under this plan, there were 1,854,858  shares 
available for purchase as of January  28, 2023. During 2022  and 2021 , partic ipating employees purchased 119,518  
shares and 300,788  shares, respectively.

Valuation Model and Assumptions  
The Black -Scholes option -pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options and the stock purchase plan . 
The Black -Scholes option -pricing model incorporates various and subjective assumptions, including expected term 
and expected volatility.  
We es timate the expected term of options  using our historical exercise and post -vesting employment termination 
patterns, which we believe are representative of future behavior. The expected term for the employee stock purchase 
plan valuation is based on the len gth of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the offering period, 
which is one year. 
We estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a weighted -average of our historical 
volatility and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock. We believe that this combination of historical 
volatility and implied volatility provides a better estimate of future stock price volatility.  
The risk -free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve  nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero -
coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected dividend 
yield is derived from our historical experience.  
The following table shows the assumptions used to co mpute the share -based compensation expense:

22. Share -Based Compensation  (continued)  
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units  
Restricted stock units (“RSU”) may be awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and nonemployee 
directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to officers and certain key employees in  
connection with our long -term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to receive one share of 
our common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are satisfied. PSU awards 
granted in 2022 also include a performance objective based on our relative total shareholder return over the 
performance period to a pre -determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The fair value of these 
awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the grant and share -based compensation 
expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual awards.   
Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for e mployees and one year for 
nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to the 
terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection with the 
relevant performance period and vest after an additional one -year period. No dividends are paid or accumulated on 
any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized using the market value at the date of grant and is 
amortized over the vesting period.

respectively. At January  28, 2023 , there was  $27 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 
nonvested awards.    
23. Legal Proceedings  
Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, 
including administrative proceedin gs, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold 
or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, 
customer, privacy, environmental, and employment -related claims . Additionally, the Company is a defendant in two 
purported class actions alleging wage/hour and wage statement violation s in California.  
We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated 
subsi diaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, 
liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration 
current accruals. Litigation is inhe rently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or settlements made that could 
adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  
There were no disagreements between the Company and its independent registered public accounting firm on 
matters of accounting principles or p ractices.  
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
The Company ’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the 
Company ’s Chief Executive Officer ( “CEO ”) and Chief Financ ial Officer ( “CFO ”), of the effectiveness of the 
design and operation of the Company ’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 
13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act ”)) as of 
January 28, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company ’s CEO  and CFO  have concluded that the Company ’s 
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of Janu ary 28, 2023, due to deficiencies identified at  
our WSS business  resulting in a material weakness , discussed below in Management ’s Annual Report on 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  
Per Rules 13a -15(e) and 15d -15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other 
procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in 
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processe d, 
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC ’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls 
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required 
to be disclosed by an issuer in  the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and 
communicated to the issuer ’s management, including its CEO  and CFO , or persons performing similar functions, 
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclos ure.  
The Company ’s management, including the CEO  and CFO , does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent 
limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not 
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent 
limitations are known features of the financial reporting pro cess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the 
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  
In light of  the material weakness described below, management performed additional analysis and other 
procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP). According ly, management believes that the 
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 -K fairly present, in all material 
respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for each of the periods presente d 
herein, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting (as that term is def ined in Exchange Act Rules 13a -15(f) and 15d -15(f)). To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, the Company uses the framework in 
Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsor ing Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (the “2013 COSO Framework”). Using the 2013 COSO Framework, the Company’s 
management, including the CEO and CFO, under the oversight of the Board of Directors, evaluated the 
Company’s internal control over finan cial reporting and concluded that the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting was not effective as of January  28, 2023.  
  
 
2022 Form 10 -K Page 69 
 A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that : 
(1) pertain to the mainten ance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statement s in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
Company; and  
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding p revention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not pre vent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedur es may deteriorate.  
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, 
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial 
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  
Management identified a material weakness related to ineffective general information technology controls over 
logical access and change management at our WSS business. As a result, process level automat ed controls 
and manual controls that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the 
affected information systems were also ineffective. This material weakness resulted from ineffective risk 
assessment associated with the information technology  environment and individuals with insufficient knowledge 
and training associated with designing and implementing the controls.  
The control deficiencies did not result in any errors. However, the control deficiencies created a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or 
detected on a timely basis. Therefore, we concluded that the deficiencies represent  a material weakness in the 
Company’s internal control over finan cial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not 
effective as of January 28, 2023.  
Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements included in this Annual Rep ort on Form 10 -K, has issued an adverse opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 9A(d).  
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
Management , with oversight from the  Audit Committee of the Board of Directors , has begun certain remedial 
actions and is developing a full plan , which will be executed during fiscal 2023. This plan may include, among 
other items, additional risk assessment procedures over information techno logy, modification s and 
enhancement s to controls, and additional training related to the design and implementation of control 
procedures. These deficiencies will not be considered remediated until the remediation plan is complete,  and 
controls have been op erational for a sufficient period of time and successfully tested.  
There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a -15(f) and 15d -
15(f) under the Exchange Act)  during the quarter ended January  28, 2023 that h ave materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
(d) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
The report appears on the following page.  
  
 
2022 Form 10 -K Page 70 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors  
Foot Locker,  Inc.: 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
We have audited Foot Locker, Inc.  and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of 
January  28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissio n. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness, 
described below, on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, bas ed on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.    
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversigh t Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related 
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each 
of the years in the three -year period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial 
statements), and our report dated March 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial 
statements.  
A mat erial weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will 
not be pre vented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related to ineffective general information technology 
controls over logical access and change management has been identified and included in management’s assessment. The 
material weakness was consid ered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 
2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements . 
Basis for Opinion  
The Company’s man agement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Annual Report on Internal Control  over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and 
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards requi re that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in 
all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an und erstanding of internal 
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performin g such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for 
our opinion.  
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
A company’s internal control over financ ial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gener ally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) pr ovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accor dance with authorizations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect o n the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,  
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls  may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
