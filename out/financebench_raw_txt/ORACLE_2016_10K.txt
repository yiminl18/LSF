Item 1.     Business
Oracle Corporation 
provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—application, platform andinfrastructure. Our Orac
le Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application, platfor m, compute and storage services in all threeprimary layers of the 
cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise offerings includeOracle database and 
middleware software, appl ication software, hardware (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry-specificproducts), and related suppor
t and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to over 400,000 worldwide customers via deployment models that bestsuit their needs.
Our comprehensive and fully in
tegrated stack of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the softwar e, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in ITenvironments that we deploy, suppor
t and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enablecustomers 
shorter time to innovat ion; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enableinterchangeability and exten
dibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premis e IT environmentsand the Oracle Cloud; cost-e
ffective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the coretechnologies of cloud IT envi
ronments, including database and midd leware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scalesystems management and r
elated infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud servic es andour customers’ cloud IT envi
ronments.In addition to providing a broad sp
ectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our products and s ervices to our customers worldwide for use in their global datacenters and on-premise 
IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we o
ffer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested $5.8billion, $5.5 billion and $5.2 bill
ion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop newtechnologies and services. 
We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We 
focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies tomake them more cost-effective and
 easier to deploy, manage and maintain fo r our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to ourcompetitors. After the 
initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to take advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purch
asing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards appl
ication software products, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.As customers deploy with the Oracl
e Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through theOracle Cloud, while other of the
ir IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. Our recently introduced Oracle Cloud at Customer provides 
an additional deployment model that customers may opt for and utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine to bring certain OracleCloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a custo
mer’s on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data r esidency, data protection and regulatory business policyrequirements, among othe
rs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility,compatibility, extens
ibility and seamlessness.A selective and active 
acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe ou r acquisitions enhance the products and servicesthat we can offer to custo
mers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholdervalue. In 
recent years, we have inves ted billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to,or have otherwise enhanced our 
existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, servic es and technologies to further our corporatestrategy.

ts and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs. This approach is designed to support customer choice andreduce customer risk. Our sof
tware offerings are substantially designed to operate on both singl e server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premiseIT environments, and to support a 
choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third-party UNIX products, among others.
Our application and platfo
rm technologies are marketed, sold and delivered through our cloud and on-premise software business, which includes our cloud softwa reand on-premise software seg
ment and software license updates and product support segment, among others. Cloud software and on-premise software revenuesrepresented 25%, 26% and 28% of ou
r total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectiv ely. Software license updates and product support revenuesrepresented 51%, 49% and 47% of ou
r total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Application Technologies
Our application technologi
es are available through subscription to our Oracle Cloud SaaS of ferings or by the purchase of an on-premise software license.Regardless of the deployment 
model selected, our application technologies are designed to reduce the risk, cost and complexity of our customers’ IT infrastructures, while suppo
rting customer choice with flexible deployment models that readily enable agility, compatibility and extendibility.

etition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a com petitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firmsemerge, expand or are a
cquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.Our customers are demanding 
less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprisesoftware and hardware. Our ente
rprise cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings compete directly with some offerings from some of the largest andmost competitive comp
anies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), International Business Mach ines Corporation (IBM), Intel, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, SAP SE and Amazon.com, Inc. 
and smaller companies like salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc., as well as many others. In addition, due tothe low barriers to 
entry in many of our marke t segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Ourcompetitors range fro
m companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offe rings focused on aspecific functional
ity, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existingcompetitors, as well as f
irms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or ourcompetitors may take 
certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lin es—which invite even greatercompetition in one or mor
e product offering categories.Key competitive factors 
in each of the segments in whi ch we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalability, reli
ability, security, functionality, efficiency, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and the relativestrength of our products and serv
ices versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 
 
•  the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; 
 
•  ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
 
• compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premise IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our OracleCloud environments;

Table of Contents 
•  the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
 
•  the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 
 
• operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
 
•  the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
 
•  products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
 
•  products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 
 
•  attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about 
the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.Oracle Cloud Operations
Oracle Cloud Operations delive
rs our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings to customers through the Orac le Cloud, which is a secure, reliable, scalable, enterprise gradeplatform that is deploy
ed upon Oracle’s application, platform and infrastructure products and is managed by Oracle employees within a global network of data centers. The Oracle Cloud enab
les secure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaSofferings via a broad spec
trum of devices and leverages automated software lifecycle management to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technologycapabilities as they b
ecome available.Manufacturing
To produce our hardware products, we r
ely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist prima
rily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise anddata center servers, s
torage products and networking products. For all other manufactu ring, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce ourhardware-related co
mponents and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these componen
ts and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturingprocesses substantially a
re based on standardization of components across product types, centralizat ion of assembly and distribution centers and a “build-to-order”methodology in which products gener
ally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchasematerials, supplies, produ
ct subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources ofsupply or such sources are read
ily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware p roducts. As a result, we continue to evaluatepotential risks of disrupt
ion to our supply chain operations. Refer to “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of thechallenges we encounter with 
respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.Research and Development
We develop the 
substantial majority o f our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property throughacquisitions of businesses and t
echnologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal de velopment allows us tomaintain technica
l control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications thatrelate to various aspe
cts of our products and technology. While we b elieve that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principalbusiness segments. Research and dev
elopment expenditures were $5.8 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2016,  
19

Table of Contents2015 and 2014, respectively, or 16%, 14% 
and 13% of total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware andsoftware development, evolv
ing standards in computer hardwa re and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions,offerings and enhancemen
ts characterize the cloud and on-premise software and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of r
esources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.Employees
As of May 31, 2016, we employed approximate
ly 136,000 full-time employees, including approximately 38,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 6,000 in ourcloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, approx
imately 10,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of ourhardware 
products, approximately 5,000 in h ardware support, approximately 23,000 in services, approximately 40,000 in research and development andapproximately 13,000 in gener
al and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 51,000 were employed in the United States and approximately85,000 were employed internat
ionally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries laborunions or workers’ councils 
represent some of our emp loyees.Available Information

Factors We operate in rapidly 
changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot con trolor predict. The following discuss
ion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations (I
tem 7), highlights some of these r isks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider theserisks and uncertainties b
efore investing in our securities.Our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Plat
form as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data as aService (DaaS) offerings, may adverse
ly affect our revenues and profitabilit y.     We offer customers a full range of consumption models, including thedeployment of our products via ou
r cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not b e able tocompete effectiv
ely, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaSdelivery models offer
ed by us and our competitors may unfavor ably impact the pricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, andhas a dampening impact on ove
rall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which has reduced and could continue to reduce our revenues and profitabil
ity, at least in the near term. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of ourcustomers, our reputation 
as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenu es and profitability could decline.As customer demand for our cloud o
fferings increases, we experience volatility in our repor ted revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue recognition betwe
en our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscript
ion basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions. The deferred revenuethat results from sal
es of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediatelyobservable in our consolidat
ed statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby newsoftware licenses 
revenues are general ly recognized in full at the time of delivery of 
21

Table of Contentsthe related software 
licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability torecognize the revenues 
associated with these offerings. We have also acquired a nu
mber of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as ef ficient orscalable as anticipated, w
hich could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, 
integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products andservices.     
Rapid technological advanc es, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communicationsinfrastructure, chang
ing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product in troductions and enhancements characterize the industries inwhich we compete. If we are unab
le to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely 
manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware orcloud offerings or renew softwa
re support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewa ls of these contracts are important to the growth of ourbusiness. In addition, we cannot provid
e any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively forbusiness opportunities in eme
rging areas.We have continued to ref
resh and release new offerings of our cloud and on-premise software and hardware products and servic es, including our DatabaseMultitenant, Database In
-Memory, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if: 
 
•  we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; 
 
•  there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service; 
 
•  there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; 
 
•  we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or 
 
•  we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.If our security measures for our products and services are 
compromised and as a result, our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improp
erly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged,the IT services we provide to our customers 
could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulator
y actions.     We are in the IT business, and ou r products and services, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, stor
e, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have areputation for secure 
and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity andsecurity of our products, serv
ices and the internal and external data that we manage.At times, we encounter att
empts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gainunauthorized access to our o
r our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to thecompromise of personal i
nformation or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Computer hackers and others m ay be able to develop anddeploy IT related viruses, wor
ms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of ourproducts and services, 
create system disrupt ions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third-party data, products or services incorporatedinto our own. Data may also be acc
essed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasa nce and third parties mayattempt to fraudulen
tly induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other informationin order to gain access to ou
r data, our customers’, suppli ers’ or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, its customers, suppliers or partners. 
22

Table of ContentsHigh-profile security breac
hes at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government off icials have warned about therisks of hackers and cyber-
attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects other software and hardwarecompanies, it affec
ts Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oraclebecause of our reputation 
for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continu e to grow ourcloud offerings and store and p
rocess increasingly large amounts of data, including personal information and our customers’ confidential information and data andother external data, 
and host or manage parts of our customers’ busin esses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularlysensitive data such as hea
lth sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, servic
es and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquiredcompanies, we may still inh
erit such risks when we integrate these comp anies within Oracle.We could suffer signifi
cant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unautho rized access to or modification ofour customers’ or suppliers
’ data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if ourproducts or 
services are perce ived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services,including our cloud offerings, 
and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and se rvices and result in reduced revenueand earnings. The costs we would incur to 
address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead tolawsuits, 
regulatory investigations  and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraudmonitoring.
Our business practices with respect to the coll
ection, use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities orreputational harm as a result of 
governmental regulation, legal requirem ents or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy 
issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of pe rsonal information expand and becomemore complex, potentia
l risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. For example, in October 2015, the Court of Justice of theEuropean Union (EU) 
invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Fra mework, which Oracle as well as many other global enterprises had relied on in certain contexts toenable the transfer o
f EU personal data to the United States. While Oracle adapted to this judgment by implementing other transfer mecha nisms permitted underapplicable law, the val
idity of these other mechanisms could also be challenged. If successful, this could require Oracle to make disruptive operational adjustmentsto the delivery of certain 
services that could imp act customers and sales in the region. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are consideringenacting legislation o
r regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could sig nificantly impact the ability ofOracle and our customers and d
ata partners to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain servicesOracle provides and data 
services. This could be true p articularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personalinformation is defined, 
therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to the opera tions of Oracle and itscustomers and data provide
rs. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized“in country,” as this 
imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operationalprocesses that are dif
ficult and costly to integrate with global processes.Regulators globally are a
lso imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations, and the EU is considering legislation that would impose fines for privacy violations based on a percen
tage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, suchas healthcare data or other 
personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and se rvices or even prevent us from offering certain ofour services in jurisdic
tions that we operate. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect Oracle’s reputatio
n or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracle’s ability to provide certain 
23

Table of Contentsproducts. Any failure, or perc
eived failure, by Oracle to comply with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulatingprivacy, data security, o
r consumer protection, or oth er policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lostor restricted business, pro
ceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harmour reputation.
We might experience significant 
coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our software, hardware and cloud offerings.     Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the 
lifecycle of a product or service, our software, hardware and cloud offerings sometimes contain coding or manufac turing errors that canimpact their function, performa
nce and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software,hardware or cloud offerings 
can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our so ftware, hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function oroperate with other softwar
e, hardware or cloud offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, could creat
e security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includesthird-party software produ
cts or services incorporated into our own. If we exp erience errors or delays in releasing our software, hardware or cloud offerings or newversions thereof, our sales 
could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and o ther services thatwe offer to our customers on our p
roducts and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of ourcustomers. Enterprise cus
tomers rely on our software, hardware and cloud offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our software, hardware orcloud offerings could expose us to p
roduct liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impactour future sales.
We may fail to achieve our financia
l forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.     Our revenues, particular ly our new software licenses revenuesand hardware revenues, are d
ifficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially.We use a “pipeline” syst
em, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals andestimate when a customer 
will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline.Our pipeline estimates 
can prove to be unreliable both in a particular qua rter and over a longer period of time, in part because the “conversion rate” or “closurerate” of the pipelin
e into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budgetincorrectly and advers
ely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedlyreduce the conversion ra
te in particular periods as pu rchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected bythe tendency of some of our cus
tomers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which c an also impede our ability tonegotiate, execute and d
eliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how theirpipelines will convert in
to sales or revenues for a number of qu arters following the acquisition. Conversion rates post-acquisition may be quite different from theacquired companies’ his
torical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in business practices tha t we implement in ournewly acquired companies. Thes
e changes may negatively affect customer behavior.A substantial 
portion of our ne w software licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are largerorders. Because a signific
ant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfa lls tend to have a disproportionately negativeimpact on our profitabi
lity. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions increases the risk offluctuations in 
our quarterly results be cause a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fallsignificantly short of our p
redictions.We may experience foreign currency ga
ins and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue andprofitability. 
    We conduct a significant numb er of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies,
 
24

Table of Contentsparticularly the Euro, J
apanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cashflows, which are reported in 
U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the valueof the Euro to fluctuate 
relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, most notably the recent strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euroand most other major int
ernational currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting ourforeign currency resul
ts into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actua l demand for our products and services as these products become relatively more expensive forforeign currency-based 
enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outsid e of theUnited States. Generally, our r
evenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positivelyaffected when the dolla
r weakens. In addition, our reported assets gener ally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as asignificant portion of our 
consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies. The U.S. Dollar generally strengthened relative toother currencies, inc
luding the Euro, in fiscal 2016, which is reflected in our results.In addition, we incur foreign 
currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expec
t to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign currency forward 
contracts designed to offset the risks associated with cer tain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time.As a part of this program, we ent
er into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign cu
rrency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains orlosses. A large portion of our consol
idated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreigncurrency exposures, net of ga
ins or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances i
f it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend ourforeign currency forward 
contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to cu rrency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type ofcross-currency exposures th
at we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward 
contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financialposition and cash flows.
Certain of our internat
ional subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary. We have incurred foreign currency losses associatedwith the devaluation of cur
rencies in these highly inflationa ry economies relative to the U.S. Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries orother emerging marke
t countries where we do business.Economic, political and market condit
ions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitability, which in turn could 
adversely affect our stock pri ce.     Our business is influenced by a rang e of factors that are beyond our control and that we haveno comparative advantag
e in forecasting. These include: 
 
•  general economic and business conditions; 
 
•  overall demand for enterprise software, cloud offerings, hardware and services; 
 
•  governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
 
•  general political developments.Macroeconomic developm
ents like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in Europe and parts of the United States, Asia and South America couldnegatively affect ou
r business, operating results, financial condition and ou tlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of,and related declining 
corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or e
liminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services orcause customers not to pay us or 
to delay paying us for previously purchased products and s ervices. 
25

Table of ContentsIn addition, political un
rest in places like Ukraine, Syria and Iraq and the related potential impact on global stability, ter rorist attacks and the potential for otherhostilities in various pa
rts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertaintythat could 
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have thestrongest effect on our sa
les of new software licenses, hardware products, hardware support and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewalrates for software li
cense updates and product support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.If we are unable to compete effe
ctively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.     We face intense comp etition in all aspects ofour 
business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves and as delivery mode
ls change. Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application deve lopment tools, business applications,collaboration products and bus
iness intelligence products, among others, that compete with our cloud and on-premise software offerings. These vendors include on-premise software 
companies and companies th at offer cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitivealternatives to buying sof
tware and hardware. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer’s purchasingdecision for the underlying d
atabase in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introducenew competitive products, add n
ew functionality, acquire competiti ve products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or formstrategic alliances with other
 companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellec
tual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.Our hardware business competes with, 
among others, (1) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systemsand those of our competitors, 
(2) microprocessor/chip manufacturer s, (3) providers of storage products, (4) certain industry-specific hardware manufacturersincluding those serving commun
ications, hospitality and retail industries and (5) certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructure. Our ha rdwarebusiness causes us to compete with 
certain companies that historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do inmanaging a hardware business. A la
rge portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform,which has a smaller insta
lled base than certain of our competitors’ platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investmen
ts in our competitors’ platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive positioncould result in lower revenu
es or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business.We may need to change our pricing 
models to compete successful ly.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and generaleconomic and business conditions 
can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on cer tain products or services or developproducts that the marke
tplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any suchchanges may reduce marg
ins and could adversely affe ct operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by usand our competitors may unf
avorably impact the pricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, as well as ove rall demand for ouron-premise software produc
t and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our software license updates and product support fees andhardware support fees are g
enerally priced as a percentag e of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitorsmay offer lower pricing on 
their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing. Any broad-based change to our pric
es and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and ou r customersadjust to the new pricing poli
cies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guaranteesof prices and product impl
ementations. These practices could, over t ime, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we donot adapt our pricing models 
to reflect changes in customer use of our 
26

Table of Contentsproducts or changes in custome
r demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricingmodels.
Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that 
can adversely affect our operating results.     We derive a substantia l portion of ourrevenues from, and have signi
ficant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software and hardware development,manufacturing, 
assembly, cloud operations, sa les, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.Compliance with 
international and U.S. laws and regu lations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.These laws and regulations inc
lude U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor r elations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations,prohibitions on payments to govern
mental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result infines, 
criminal sanctions ag ainst us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitionson our ability to offer our p
roducts and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential a cquisitions and could also materially damage ourreputation, our brand, our int
ernational expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Compliance with theselaws 
requires a significan t amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and couldharm our ability to grow our busin
ess, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.Our success depends, in part, on our abi
lity to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations ofimproprieties rel
ating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report ourfindings to government author
ities, but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities. We are also subject to 
a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those r elated to: 
 
•  general economic conditions in each country or region; 
 
•  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; 
 
• difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our cash ass
ets, in that country’s currency; 
 
• regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly impair bank d
eposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay inthese countries;
 
 
•  political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Ukraine, Syria, and Iraq; 
 
•  common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
 
•  natural disasters; 
 
•  the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
 
•  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
 
•  overlapping tax regimes; 
 
•  our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; 
 
•  public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and 
 
•  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.

Table of ContentsThe variety of risks and cha
llenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our h ardware products segmentand the sales of our products and s
ervices in affected countries or regions.As the 
majority shareholder o f Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (OFSS), a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan (NOKK), apublicly traded company in J
apan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local secur ities regulations and being unable to exert fullcontrol that we would otherwise hav
e if OFSS or NOKK were wholly-owned subsidiaries.Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the 
financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.     We continue to invest 
billions of dollars to acqu ire companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continueto make acquisitions in th
e future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate st rategy. Risks we may face in connection with ouracquisition program inc
lude: 
 
•  our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
 
• we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experi

• an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as weexpected, we may impose our busin
ess practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, orotherwise not realize 
the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially causeimpairment to assets 
that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; 
 
• our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise re
lated to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or formercustomers, former stockh
olders or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not h ave otherwiseentered into, the ter
mination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue recognition or other accountingtreatment as a resu

• we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,which could result in unexpect
ed litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss ofanticipated tax bene
fits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition;  
 
• we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number ofcustomers decline to r
enew software or hardware support contracts or cloud-based subscription contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products orservice offerings to our 
customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenu es on a timely basis; 
 
• we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines ofbusiness and supply chain infrast
ructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; 
 
• we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and d
elays; 
 
• we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrativefunctions that support new business mod
els, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated; 
28

Table of Contents 
• we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or simila
r bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans incertain jurisdict
ions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses; 
 
• we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, whichcould, among other t
hings, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategicgoals of an acquisition or hav
e other adverse effects on our current business and operations; 
 
• our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement ofoutstanding indebtedness;
 
 
• we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and wemay have to delay or not proc
eed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manneror on favorable terms;
 
 
• to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted andearnings per share may de
crease; and 
 
• we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles, in
cluding arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.The occurrence of any of th

f we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware business.     Our hardware business may adversely affect 
our overall profitabi lity if we do not effectively manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financialprojections with respect 
to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:  
 
• demand for competing hardware technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services, which could adversely affect demand for ourhardware products offerings;
 
 
• our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and on-premise softwarebusiness;
 
 
• our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, OracleExalytics In-Memory Mach
ine and Oracle SuperCluster products, which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers, and the de-emphasis of our lower profit 
margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profitproducts have historical
ly constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues; 
 
• as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware products, customers may defer or delay purchases of existing hardwareproducts and wait for these new r
eleases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues in the short term; 
 
• a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and impairments of our inventories;higher warranty expenses than wha
t we experience in our cloud and on-premise software and services businesses; and amortization and potentialimpairment of intang
ible assets associated with our hardware business; 
 
• we may not be able to increase sales of hardware support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate, which could result in lowerrevenues and profitabil
ity, or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; and

• we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operatingmargins than our own; (2) have di
fferent legacy business practices and go-to-market strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integrationefforts, which may signifi
cantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) leverage different  platforms or competingtechnologies that we ma
y encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquiredproducts within our own 
manufacturing operations. Our hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully 
manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will suff er.    Designing, developing, manufactu
ring and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes. The development process for our hardware products isuncertain and requires 
a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardwareproducts in sufficient volu
mes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our “build-to-order” manu facturing model, in which our hardwareproducts generally are no
t built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in atimely manner. 
These delays could cause our cus tomers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardwareproduct introductions and tr
ansitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation o f new hardware productreleases. It is also possib
le that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws, which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which wehave previously committ
ed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardwareproducts to be returned, re
called or rejected resulting in lost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation effor ts, damage to our reputation,penalties and litigation.
We depend on suppliers to design, dev
elop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the nec essary technologies and components for our hardware products, andthere are some techno
logies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other businessconstraints. As a result, our supply 
chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation, natural disasters, political unrest, portstoppages or other transport
ation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countr ies or regions where these single source component vendors arelocated or where the produc
ts are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or mayexperience 
significant delays or qua lity issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a newsupplier for these techno
logies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect ou r hardware revenues. Wecould also experience f
luctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure. Additionally, wecould experience changes 
in shipping and logistics of our hardwa re products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardwaremargins. These factors m
ay make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to mee t customer demand forour hardware products. Therefo
re, we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchasefewer hardware products fro
m us or hardware products from our competitors. W e negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing processto ensure we have sufficien
t technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventori
es used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary towrite-down the inventory, which would adve
rsely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks desc ribed above occurs, our hardware business and relatedoperating results could be 
materially and adversely affected.We are susceptible to third-party 
manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.     We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly 
and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Ourreliance on these third 
parties reduces our cont rol over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over qualityassurance, product costs, produc
t supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of  the international locationswhere certain of these 
third-party 
30

Table of Contentsmanufacturers have facilities and
 operations. Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location ofmanufacture or sourcing. Any 
manufacturing disruption o r logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardwareproducts for extended periods o
f time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third  parties experience delays,disruptions, capacity const
raints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, ourability to ship and 
deliver certain of ou r hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed.We have simplified our 
supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-partymanufacturers build our h
ardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partne rs and locations. If thesepartners experience p
roduction problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timelyor cost-effective 
manner, if at all. If we are required to change third-party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to ourcustomers could be adverse
ly affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in ourhardware products expenses, al
l of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business.These challenges and risks a
lso exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may bedependent, at least ini
tially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react tothese challenges and risks.
Our software and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operat
ing results.     Our software and hardware indirect channel network is comprisedprimarily of resel
lers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent softwarevendors. Our relationships with thes
e channel participants are i mportant elements of our software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial resultscould be adversely affe
cted if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to de teriorate, if any ofour competitors enter 
into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participantswere to weaken or if the lev
el of demand for our channel par ticipants’ products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successfulin maintaining, expanding or d
eveloping our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportuniti es, customers andrevenues.
We may not be able to protect our inte
llectual property rights.     We rely on copyright, trad emark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls and contractual c
ommitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited.  Unauthorized third partiesmay try to copy or reverse 
engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated,circumvented or chal
lenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of theclaims we seek, if at a
ll. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual prope rty rights as do the laws andcourts of the United States. I
f we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remaincompetitive.
Third parties have claimed and, in the future, may 
claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.     We periodically re
ceive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rightsand/or breach of our agre
ements with them. These third parties inc lude entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products orservices or that acquire intellect
ual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting c laims ofinfringement and misuse. 
We expect to continue to receive such claims as: 
 
•  we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; 
 
•  the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
31

Table of Contents 
•  the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
 
•  the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
 
•  the proliferation of non-practicing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases.Responding to any such claim, rega
rdless of its validity, could: 
 
•  be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
 
•  divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
 
•  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 
 
•  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
 
•  require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
 
•  require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
 
•  otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales for
ce, can be disruptive.     We have in the past restructured o r made otheradjustments to our workforce, 
including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues,change in strategies, a
cquisitions and other internal and externa l considerations. In the past, these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increasedrestructuring costs, inc
reased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibi lities. Inaddition, we may not achieve o
r sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effectscould recur in connection wi
th future acquisitions and other res tructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.We may lose key 
employees or may be unable to hire enough qualifi ed employees.     We rely on hiring qualif ied employees and the continued service of oursenior management, inc
luding our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder, ou r Chief Executive Officers, other members of ourexecutive team and oth
er key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, productdevelopment, 
technical and other pe rsonnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or highersales. We may not be success
ful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare ex ceptions, we do not have long-termemployment or non-competiti
on agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons,and we cannot assure you that 
there will not be addition al departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.We continually focus on imp
roving our cost structure by hiring personnel in c ountries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lowercosts. When we make adjustmen
ts to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We 
may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affectour employee retention effort
s and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compens ation program.Our general compensation prog
ram includes restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock options, which are important tools in attracting and retainingemployees in our ind
ustry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate ourcompensation practices and 
consider changes from ti me to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awardsgranted per employee and g
ranting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain e mployees and the amount ofstock-based compensation exp
ense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain andmotivate existing personn
el and recruit new personnel.

Table of ContentsOur sales to government clients expose us to business vola
tility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early ter mination, audits,investigations, sanctions and penalties. 
    We derive revenues fro m contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and their respective ag
encies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies,both domestically and int
ernationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government con tracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by theU.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under th
ese contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, foreign governments and theiragencies are genera
lly subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations whichcould result in various civ
il and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination o f contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeitureof profits, suspension of payments, 
fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.We may not receive signifi
cant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.     Developing software, cloud and hardware 
offerings is expensive and th e investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element ofour corporate strategy 
is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and relat ed product and service opportunities both throughinternal investments 
and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductions and shortsoftware and 
hardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset byrevenue increases. We b
elieve that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our resear ch and development efforts to maintain ourcompetitive position. However, we do no
t expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.Business disruptions could adversely affect our operat
ing results.     A significant portion of our c ritical business operations are concent rated in a few geographicareas. We are a highly 
automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including someof our cloud offerings. A major 
earthquake, fire or oth er catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systemscould severely affec
t our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially a nd adversely affected.Adverse litigation results could aff
ect our business.     We are subject to var ious legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations, and can divert ou
r management’s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigat ion also cannot be predicted with certainty.An adverse decision could resul
t in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additionalinformation regarding 
certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere inthis Annual Report.
We may have exposure to additional tax liab
ilities.     As a multinational corpor ation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in boththe 
United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other taxliabilities. We a
re regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings m
ay have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax ra te. For example, the United States, many countries in the EU, andother countries where we do business, 
are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations,including changes to tax laws app
licable to corporate multinationals, which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in theordinary course of a global bus
iness, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the u ltimate tax determination is uncertain. Ourintercompany transfe
r pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likelybe subject to 
additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateralAdvance Pricing Agreements tha
t cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax aut horities from making a transfer pricingadjustment within the scope o
f these agreements, these agreements do not cover 
33

Table of Contentssubstantial elements o
f our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious. Similarly,certain jurisdictions are 
increasingly raising con cerns about certain withholding tax matters. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affectedby earnings being lower than ant
icipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States tha t have lower statutory tax ratesand earnings being higher than 
anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates.We are also subject to non
-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United Statesand various foreign jurisdi
ctions. We are regularly under aud it by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additionalnon-income based tax liab
ilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our en try into the hardwarebusiness, which increased the volu
me and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply.Although we believe that our inco
me and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or taxdisputes will not be differ
ent from what is reflected in our histo rical income tax provisions and accruals.Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adverse
ly affect our operating results.     Under business combination accoun ting standards pursuant to ASC805, 
Business
Combinations
, we recognize the identi fiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in acquired companiesgenerally at their 
acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount ofconsideration transfe
rred, which is also generally measured at fair va lue, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and theliabilities assumed. Our 
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following f
actors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: 
 
• costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment orrelocation expenses;
 
 
• impairment of goodwill, in particular within our consulting reporting unit, or impairment of intangible assets, both asset types of which have increased in recent years due to our a
cquisitions and may continue to increase in the future; 
 
•  amortization of intangible assets acquired; 
 
•  a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; 
 
• identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies o
r the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; 
 
• charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is lo
nger than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure ouroperations or to reduce our 
cost structure; 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 
 
•  charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.Substantially all of thes
e costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. For example, we re
cognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit. Charges to ouroperating results in any giv
en period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and s ize of our future acquisitions and the extent ofintegration activi
ties. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of M
anagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7).

Table of ContentsThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future 
indebtedness.     As of May 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $43.9 bil lion of outstandingindebtedness that will ma
ture between calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the p
rincipal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service suchdebt and the other facto
rs discussed in this section. There can be no assurance th at we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.We may also need to ref
inance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matu res. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms ofany refinancing may not be 
as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancin g result inhigher interest rat
es upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interestexpense, our ability to uti
lize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provisionfor income taxes and ef
fective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debtand equity securities and 
increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition andresults of operations.
Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could r
esult in significant liabilities and costs.     Some of our cloud and hardware operations ar
e subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials usedfor these products, human 
health and safety, the use o f certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers. We endeavor to comply with theseenvironmental and other 
laws, yet compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delive
ry, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our salesactivities, or otherwis
e impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any viola tion of these laws can subject us to significant liability,including fines, penalti
es and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condit
ion or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.The U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commissio n has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (commonly referred to astantalum, tin, tungsten and go
ld) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardwar e end products, we areseveral steps removed f
rom the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certaintythe origin and chain of custody 
of conflict minera ls is limited. Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our productsas “conflict-free.” We may also face
 increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements. A significant portion of our ha
rdware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction o f HazardousSubstances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electr
ical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods forControlling Pollution Caused by Elect
ronic Information Products, may increase our cos t of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues fromthe EU, China and other countries with s
imilar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact of international envi
ronmental legislation could be significant.Our stock price could become more vola
tile and your investment could lose value.     All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. Thetiming of announcements in 
the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors o r us and anyannouncements by us of acquisit
ions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of sharerepurchases or dividends could 
adversely affect our stock price. Our stock pric e is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes inrecommendations or ea
rnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and m arkettrends unrelated to our pe
rformance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result insubstantial costs and diver
t management’s attention and resources, whi ch could adversely affect our business.

Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies rela tive to the U.S. Dollar,which decreased our fiscal 2016 and 2015 total revenues by 5 and 4 pe
rcentage points, respectively, total operating expenses by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively, and total operating income by 7 and 6 percentage points, respectively, in compa
rison to the corresponding prior year periods. 
 
Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from ou r net income generated during allperiods presented and the issuances of 
long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013. Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of $3.8 billion o
f short term borrowings in fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments andcapital 
expenditures made in all periods pre sented and the repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2013. 
 
Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable, current and other current borrowings, and notes payable and other non-current borrowings as repor ted per ourconsolidated balance sheets as of the date
s listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2016 due to the issuances of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to our revolving credit agreements in fiscal 2016, and 
the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014, and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013. See Note 8 of Notes toConsolidated

Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discuss
ion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our busin esses, key operating segmentsand significant trends. This ov
erview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding theassumptions and 
judgments incorporated in ou r reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financialcondition.
Business Overview
Oracle Corporation provides produ
cts and services that address all aspects of corporate in formation technology (IT) environments—application, platform andinfrastructure. Our Orac
le Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application, platform, compute and storage services in all three primary layers of the 
cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise offerings includeOracle database and middle
ware software, application software, hardware (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, sto rage, networking and industry-specificproducts), and related suppor
t and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to over 400,000 worldwide customers via deployment models that bestsuit their needs.
Our comprehensive and fully in
tegrated stack of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, suppor
t and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enablecustomers shorter tim
e to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work ; connectable among differing deployment models to enableinterchangeability 
and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environmentsand the 
Oracle Cloud; cost-effe ctive by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the coretechnologies of cloud IT envi
ronments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virt ualization, clustering, large-scalesystems management and r
elated infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services andour customers’ 
cloud IT environments. In addition to providing a broad sp
ectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our products and services to our customers worldwide for use in th eir global datacenters and on-premise 
IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, ourproducts and services that we o
ffer through our cloud and on-premise so ftware, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how allcomponents within IT environmen
ts—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We focus our development effo rts onimproving the performance,
 security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage andmaintain for our custom
ers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, ourcustomers can continue to 
take advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include p
roduct enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards applicationsoftware products, among others, o
r by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. As customers deploy with the Oracl
e Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of the
ir IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineeringof our products and services to b
est connect these different deployment models  to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness.A selective and active 
acquisition program is ano ther important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and servicesthat we can offer to custo
mers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and in crease stockholdervalue. In recent years, we h
ave invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and 
40

Table of Contentstechnologies that add to, a
re complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, servicesand technologies to furthe
r our corporate strategy. We have three businesses th
at deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: cloud and on-premise software, hardware and servi ces. Thesebusinesses can be further div
ided into certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this AnnualReport, provides additional in
formation related to our operating segments). Each o f our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and facesdifferent opportuniti
es and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we presen
t constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excludingthe effects of fore
ign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and rela ted operating segments follows.Cloud and On-Premise Software Business
Our cloud and on-premise softwar
e business, which represented 78%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is comprised of three operating segm
ents: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, (2) cloud IaaS and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constantcurrency basis, we expect th
at our cloud and on-premise software business’ total revenues genera lly will continue to increase due to continued demand for oursoftware products, expected g
rowth in our cloud and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renewtheir software licens
e updates and product support contracts, and contributions from our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow and continue to makeinvestments in resear
ch and development.Cloud Software and On-Premise Software:     
Our cloud software and on-premis e software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spect rum ofapplication and platfo
rm technologies through our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which are certain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via acloud-based IT environment 
that we host, manage and support, and through the licensing o f our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database,Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, 
among others.We believe the compr
ehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS, PaaS and on-premise software offerings provides greater benefit to our customers and differentiates usfrom many of our competi
tors that offer more limited or spec ialized software offerings. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to be interoperable with oneanother, thereby limi
ting the integration and tuning of multiple cloud applications from multiple vendors. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to d eliversecure data isolation 
and flexible upgrades, self-service access controls for users, a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for integration with on-premise systems,and a high performance, high 
availability infrastructure based on ou r infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems. Our on-premise softwareofferings are substanti
ally designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating syste
ms including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third-party UNIX products, among others. Our commitment toindustry standards results in so
ftware offerings that work in customer environments with Or acle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and that can beadapted to meet speci
fic industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premise deployment models to enable flexib
ility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. All of these approaches are designed to support customer choice and reducecustomer risk. Our customers 
include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educ ational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our softwareofferings to these custom
ers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit customer needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environ
ment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them.Our SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software 
licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetaryconstraints, the strat
egy for and competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our SaaS and PaaS contracts with our existing customers and fo
reign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and PaaSrevenues, which has affect
ed the growth of our cloud SaaS and  
41

Table of ContentsPaaS revenues and our new software li
censes revenues and the related expenses. We expect these trends will continue. Our SaaS and PaaS arrangements aregenerally one to three y
ears in duration and we strive to renew these con tracts when they are eligible for renewal. The substantial majority of our new softwarelicense transactions are characterized
 by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affec t our quarterly newsoftware licenses revenu
es.Cloud software and on-premise sof
tware revenues represented 25%, 26% and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our cloudsoftware and on-premise sof
tware segment’s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to thehistorical upward trend of ou
r new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantlyfixed in the short term. As dis
cussed further below under “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certa in Charges,” our cloud software and on-premise softwaresegment’s margin has been 
and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business combinations and by the a
mortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired.Cloud Infrastructure as a Service:     
Our cloud IaaS segment, which repr esented 2% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, and 1% of our tot alrevenues in fiscal 2014, provid
es infrastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute,storage and networking servic
es on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS seg ment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are comprehensive softwareand hardware management a
nd maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or 
physically on-premise at customer facilities.Software License Updates and 
Product Support:     Software license updates and p roduct support revenues are generated through the sale of software supportcontracts relating 
to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Customers that purchase software l icense updates and product support aregranted rights to unspecif
ied product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical supportassistance. Our software 
license updates and product suppo rt contracts are generally one year in duration. Substantially all of our on-premise software licensecustomers renew their sof
tware license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product suppo rt revenues isprimarily influenc
ed by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amountof new software support contrac
ts sold in connection with the sal e of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed fromcompanies we have acquired.
Software license updates and p
roduct support revenues, which represented 51%, 49% and 47% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, isour highest margin business unit. Our 
software support margins during fiscal 2016 were 91% and accounted for 86% of our total margins over the same period. Oursoftware license updates 
and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations and by the amor
tization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges.”Over the longer term, we bel
ieve that software license updates and product suppo rt revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: 
 
• substantially all of our on-premise new software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contractswhen eligible for renewal;
 
 
• substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in afurther increase in ou
r software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and productsupport revenues would continue to grow in 
comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal  and cancellation rates andforeign currency rates remained
 relatively constant, since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updatesand product support contracts, whi
ch add to our software support contr act base; and 
42

Table of Contents 
•  our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.Hardware Business
Our hardware business is comprised o
f two operating segments: (1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. Our hardware business represented 13% of ourtotal revenues in fisc
al 2016, and 14% of our total revenues in each o f fiscal 2015 and 2014. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as apercentage of revenues 
than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and toprovide support services, inc
luding direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardwareproducts and services and to dev
elop new hardware products and services. Hardware Products:     
We provide a broad selec tion of hardware and related services, including Oracle Engineered Systems, se rvers, storage, networking,workstations and related dev
ices, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse ITenvironments, including cloud 
computing environments. We enginee r our hardware products with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapiddeployment and effici
ent management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world’s largest cloud infr astructures,including the Oracle Cloud.
Our hardware products are design
ed to be easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers  and to improve computing performance relative to ourcompetitors’ offer
ings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect cloud and on-premise IT environments to further enable interoperability,interchangeability 
and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Ourflexible and open approach p
rovides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products, which we be lieve is a priority forour customers.
Oracle Engineered Systems a
re core to our hardware offerings and are important el ements of our data center and cloud computing offerings including the OracleCloud. These pre-integrated p
roducts are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance,availability, security and 
operational efficiency relative to our competitors’ products; to be upgraded effectively and efficiently; and to simplify maintenance cyclesby providing a single solution for so
ftware patching. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested befor e they are shipped to customers and delivered ready-to-run,enabling customers to short
en deployment time to production. We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems technologies through flexible deploymentoptions 
including as a cloud servic e and for on-premise IT environments.We offer a wide range of s
erver products using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris opera ting system and are designed to bedifferentiated by th
eir reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of ownershipthan competitive UNIX systems fo
r business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloudcomputing IT environments. Our SPARC servers ar
e also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engin eered Systems.We also offer enterp
rise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux,Microsoft Windows and other oper
ating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including the OracleExadata Database Machine, 
Oracle Exalogic Elasti c Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance.Our storage products are engin
eered for the cloud and designed to secur ely store, manage, protect, archive, backup and recover customers’ mission critical dataassets. Our storage products consis
t of disk, flash, tape, virtual tape and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archiv e software,hierarchical storage management s
oftware and networking for mainframe and heterogeneous systems environments. We also offer certain of our storage offeringsas a cloud service.

Table of ContentsOur networking and data center 
fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our serverand storage products
 and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexityand simplify storage and se
rver connectivity. We offer hardware produc
ts and services designed for certain specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware offerings include point-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are design
ed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services forcommunications networks inc
lude network signaling, policy control and subscribe r data management solutions, and session border control technology, amongothers.
The majority of our hardwar
e products are sold through indir ect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers.To produce our hardware products, 
we rely on both our internal m anufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturingoperations consist prima
rily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our en terprise anddata center servers 
and storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-relatedcomponents and hardware products 
and we may involve our internal manu facturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for thesecomponents and pro
ducts. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes 
through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which productsgenerally are built on
ly after customers have placed firm orders. Our hardware products revenues, cos
t of hardware products and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the co mpetitiveposition of our hardware products, 
the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions andforeign currency rat
e fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for ou r hardware products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization ofintangible assets.
Our quarterly 
hardware products revenues a re difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a fewlarge hardware transa
ctions, among other factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware products revenues, expenses and ope rating margins that wereport.
Hardware Support:     
Our hardware support offerings provide custome rs with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality ofour hardware products, such as Orac
le Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technica l supportservices. Typically, our ha
rdware support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees, are invoiced to the customer at thebeginning of the support period and 
are one year in duration. We continue to evo lve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solvequality issues and to incre
ase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware products. Our hardware support revenues that we repor
t are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the pricing and mix of hardwareproducts purchased, whether custo
mers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentageof our hardware support contra
ct customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to 
either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.Our hardware support margins have b
een and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating tohardware support obligations assu
med and by the amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under “Supplemental DisclosureRelated to Certain Charges.”

Table of ContentsServices Business
Our services business, which repres
ented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, iscomprised of the rema
inder of our operating segments. Our servi ces business has lower margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses.Our services revenues are 
impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general e conomic conditions,governmental budgetary cons
traints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis ongrowing our cloud revenues and the 
growth in our software and hardware o fferings. Our services business’ offerings include: 
 
• consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our offerings,including IT strategy al
ignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration, and ongoing softwareenhancements and upgrades. W
e utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, cons isting of on-premiseconsultants from local g
eographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; 
 
• advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higheravailability 
of their Oracle products and services and also include certain other services; and 
 
• education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and employees through a variety of f
ormats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events andcustom training.
Acquisitions
A selective 
and active acquisition p rogram is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire anumber of complementa
ry companies, products, services and technologies, including MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS) in fiscal 2015. We believe our acquisi
tion program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can off er to customers, expands our customerbase, provides greater sc
ale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquirecompanies, products, servic
es and technologies in further ance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewherein this Annual Report provides addit
ional information related to our recent acquisitions.We believe that we can 
fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from 
the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operatingmargin, cash flow and return on 
invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financia
l statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the FinancialAccounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codi
fication (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicableguidance issued by the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make cert ain estimates, judgments andassumptions. We believe th
at the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time thatthese estimates, judgments 
and assumptions are made. Thes e estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as ofthe date of the financ
ial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the exte nt that there are differencesbetween these estimates, j
udgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our 
45

Table of Contentsmore significant est
imates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reportedfinancial results include:
 
 
•  Revenue Recognition; 
 
•  Business Combinations; 
 
•  Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; 
 
•  Accounting for Income Taxes; and 
 
•  Legal and Other Contingencies.In many cases, the account
ing treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application.There are also areas 
in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our seniormanagement has reviewed ou
r critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
 
• cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, app
lications and industry-specific software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broadrange of our software and re
lated support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud comput ing environment; cloud IaaSofferings, which grant custom
ers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services, and also providemanagement services 
for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure, both generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates andproduct support offerings (des
cribed further below); 
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networkingand 
data center fabric products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support andeducation 
services. Revenues generally are r
ecognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Software Produc
ts and Software Related Services (Software Elements)New software licenses revenues p
rimarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products and exclude 
cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updatesand product support revenues. The bas

 We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services r
evenues to be recognized in each accounting period.For software license arr
angements that do not require significant modific ation or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licensesrevenues when: (1) we enter in
to a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of conti
ngencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not 
met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently m et.

Table of ContentsSubstantially all of our sof
tware license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions ex ist as part of public policy (forexample, in agreemen
ts with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that arereferenced in the current agreement 
and are short-term in n ature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctoryand all other revenue r
ecognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions th at are long-term innature or are not include
d as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration ofthe acceptance period.
The vast majority of our sof
tware license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related f
ees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights tounspecified software produc
t upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access totechnical content, as we
ll as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentag
e of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of ourcustomers renew their sof
tware license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue

ftware license updates and product support contr acts and other software related services whereby software license delivery isfollowed by the subsequent or conte
mporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to dete
rmine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair valueexists for undelivered eleme
nts in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of thearrangement consideration ge
nerally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element 
arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remainingamount allocated to th

Arrangements)
We enter into arrang
ements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of oneanother (referred 
to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each  element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as aseparate unit of accountin
g provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for anarrangement that includes a 
general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service isconsidered probable and is subst
antially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us oranother vendor or could be reso
ld by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the deliveredproducts. Where the aforeme
ntioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treatedas a single unit of account
ing for the purposes of allocation of the ar rangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that includemore than one deliverab
le but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we g
enerally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue classificationof the elements that 
are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocat e revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements ofoperations based on a ration
al and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our non-soft
ware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s incep tion. Theselling price for ea
ch element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, orestimated selling pr
ice (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a d escription as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangiblehardware product includes sof
tware, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if s
o, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit ofaccounting for each of th
e non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each  unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit theamount of revenue recogni
zed for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performan
ce conditions. 
48

Table of ContentsWhen possible, we establish VSOE of selling p
rice for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements usin g the price charged for adeliverable when sold separ
ately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPEis established by evaluat
ing similar and interchangeable com petitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we areunable to determine th
e selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arr angement by reviewinghistorical transac
tions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factorsincluding, but not limited 
to, pricing practices including dis counting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offerour products and services, the 
type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the s tage of theproduct lifecycle. The d
etermination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model andgo-to-market strat
egy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which couldresult in changes to our det
ermination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could  differmaterially from ou
r results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in ourselling prices.

Poli
cies
Applicable
to
Software
and
Non-software
ElementsMany of our software arrange
ments include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part ofour services business. Consulting rev
enues from these arrangements are ge nerally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because thearrangements qualify 
as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separat
ely include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degreeof risk, availability o
f services from other vendors, timing of payments and  impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software licensefee. Revenues for consulting se
rvices are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the c
onsulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance oncontracts with fixed or “no
t to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. Ifwe do not have a sufficient bas
is to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been complete
d. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based uponan average fully burdene
d daily rate applicable to the consulting organization de livering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relatingto the assumptions, risks and unce
rtainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported i
n our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates,utilization and eff
iciency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.

Table of ContentsOur advanced customer support se
rvices are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other softwa re and non-softwareproducts and services. We of
fer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higheravailability of the
ir products and services. Depending upon the natur e of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services areperformed or ratably ov
er the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.Education revenues are a
lso a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education r
evenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.If an arrangement contains 
multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licensesrevenues and/or hardware produ
cts revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the servic es based on contractaccounting using either
 the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accountedfor as a single unit of ac
counting, we allocate revenues to so ftware and non-software elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our bestestimate of the relative selling 
price of such elements.We also evaluate ar
rangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions arerequired by law, to determ
ine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions,the “essential use” of 
the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the gove rnmental entity. If wedetermine upon execution
 of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described abovehave been met. If such a 
determination cannot b e made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision bythe governmental entity.
We assess whether fees
 are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standardpayment terms are ne
t 30 days. However, payment terms may vary b ased on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard paymentterms based on whether we have suc
cessful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclud
e such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.While most of our arrang
ements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing tocreditworthy customers pr
imarily through our financing division. Since f iscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history ofcollection, without concess
ions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other r evenuerecognition criter
ia have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of anypayment discounts from fin
ancing transactions. We have generally sold receiv ables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-partyfinancing institutions with
in 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activ ities in ourconsolidated statemen
ts of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers
and
Servicing
 , as we are considered to have surrende
red control of these financing rec eivables.Our customers include sever
al of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendo rs at or about the sametime that we have sold our produ
cts to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services thatoccur within a three-mon
th time period from the date we have purch ased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accountingtreatment and disclosu
re. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s 
length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are metand the goods and services acqui
red are necessary for our current operations.

Table of ContentsBusiness Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, 
Business
Combinations
 , in accounting for our acquis itions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired and the liabi
lities assumed at the acquisition dat e fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferredover the net of the acquis
ition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assump tions to accuratelyvalue assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertainand subject to refinem
ent. As a result, during the measur ement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assetsacquired and liabili
ties assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final deter mination of the values ofassets acquired or liab
ilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.Accounting for business combinat
ions requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intang
ible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believethe assumptions and estima
tes we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are base d in part on historical experience and informationobtained from the management
 of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.Examples of critical estimates in
 valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: 
 
• future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware product sales, support agreements, consultingcontracts, other custom
er contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; 
 
• expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects whencompleted;
 
 
• the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product por
tfolio; and 
 
•  discount rates.Unanticipated events and c
ircumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We estimate the f
air values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these pe
rformance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating thecosts related to fulf
illing the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to ful fill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related toproviding the services inc
luding the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required 
to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts orresearch and development 
or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any se lling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities wouldhave concluded those selling 
efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value de
terminations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimatesfor these obligations, we did not 
recognize certain cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts thatwould have been otherwise record
ed by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations (refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certa
in Charges” below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquiredcompanies, renew their sof
tware license updates and product support contracts when the contra cts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS andPaaS contracts and hardware suppor
t contracts. To the extent 
51

Table of Contentscustomers to which these cont
ractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over therespective contracts’ 
renewal periods. In connection with a business comb
ination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our m anagement.Restructuring costs are typ
ically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuringexpenses are based upon plans tha
t have been committed to by our manag ement, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit orrestructure cert
ain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit
or
Disposal
Cost
 Obligations.
 A liability for costs associated with an 
exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in whichthe liability is incurred. W
hen estimating the fair value of facility restructuring  activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to bereceived, which can differ
 materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of op erationsand financial position in 
the period the revision is made.For a given acquisition, we may id
entify certain pre-acquisition conting encies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingenci
es throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value esti
mates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If we cannot reasonably det
ermine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which isgenerally the case giv
en the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted or a liability had
 been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or li ability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to themeasurement period, ch
anges in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financialposition.
In addition, uncertain t
ax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We r
eevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourpreliminary estim
ates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement p eriod. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination ofthe tax allowance’s or con
tingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for 
income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments
We review goodwill for impa
irment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordancewith ASC 350, 
Intangibles—Goodwill
and
 Other
 . According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qua litative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill forimpairment or we can di
rectly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value o f a reporting unit ismore likely than not (i.
e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will beperformed. In the firs
t step, we compare the fair value of each r eporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value ofthe net assets assigned to th
at unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carry ing value of the net assetsassigned to the reporting uni
t exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine theimplied fair value o
f the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the car rying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record animpairment loss equal 
to the difference.Determining the fair v
alue of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growthrates and operating ma
rgins used to calculate projected future cash fl ows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determinationof appropriate marke
t comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
52

Table of Contentsbut that are inherently u
ncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocatingshared assets and liabil
ities to determine the car rying values for each of our reporting units.Our most recent annual goodwill 
impairment analysis, which was performed on March 1, 2016, did not result in a goodwil l impairment charge, nor did werecognize an impair
ment charge in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million in our hardware products reporting unit (referto Note 7 of 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Sta tements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information).Other than our consulting 
reporting unit, all of our o ther reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recentannual goodwill impairmen
t review. Our consulting reporting unit had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March 1, 2016, and experienced revenue and operating margindeclines in fiscal 2016. As of our 
most recent annual goodwill impairment review, our consulting reporting unit’s fair value was 11% in excess of its carryingvalue. We estimate 
that should our consulting reporting unit’s p rojected margins and related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20% or moreeach year, our consulting r
eporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss.We make judgments about th
e recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we eva
luate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant arevision to the remaining
 periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset tothe future undiscounted cash 
flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstanc
es indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of thecarrying amount of the ass
et to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of a ny impairment is measured as the difference between thecarrying value and the fair
 value of the impaired asset.Assumptions and estimates about 
future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including exte
rnal factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Although we believe the histori
cal assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appro priate, different assumptions and estimates could materiallyimpact our reported f
inancial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant judgment is r
equired in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the u
ltimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursementarrangements among related entitie
s, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that q ualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreignand domestic earnings and exp
enses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters couldbe 
different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income taxprovision and net income in th
e period in which such determination is made.Our effective tax ra
te includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely re
invested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, workingcapital and investmen
t needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estima te the amount that will be distributed to the UnitedStates and provide U.S. federal t
axes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the UnitedStates or tax legislat
ion that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States couldmaterially impact our income tax 
provision and effective tax rate. 
53

Table of ContentsWe record a valuation 
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In orde r for us to realize our deferred taxassets, we must be able to gene
rate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecastedearnings, future 
taxable income, the m ix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback ispermitted under the l
aw and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In th e event we were to determine thatwe would not be able to realiz
e all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be chargedto earnings in the 
period in which we make such a det ermination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to anacquisition within the
 measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asse ts would be realized, we would reversethe applicable portion o
f the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.We calculate our current and 
deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filedduring the subsequent year. 
Adjustments based on filed re turns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications areknown, which can materially i
mpact our effective tax rate.The amount of income tax we pay 
is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcom
e for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingenciesassumed as a part of a business 
combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax r elated contingencies that are not a part of a businesscombination, we account for 
these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income
Taxes
 , which contains a two-step approa ch to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions t
aken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likelythan not that the tax posit
ion will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any r elated appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the taxbenefit as the larges
t amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved fo r ouruncertain tax positions, no assu
rance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due tochanging facts and circu
mstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial ruling s, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differfrom our estimates. To t
he extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impac t our provisionfor income taxes in the p
eriod in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes toreserves that are considered
 appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.In addition, as a part of our 
accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair v alues and goodwill is measured as the excess ofconsideration transferred o
ver the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible andwill result in an 
increased effective income tax rate i n the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assetsare generally not tax d
eductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deduc tible amortization expenses as apart of the accounting fo
r business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions,including those with 
nominal or zero percent tax  rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.Legal and Other Contingencies
We are currently invo
lved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential finan cialexposure. A description of our ac
counting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “BusinessCombinations” above. For legal and o
ther contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential lossfrom any claim or leg
al proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the det
ermination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals arebased only on the best informa
tion available at the time the accruals are made. As  
54

Table of Contentsadditional information become
s available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Suchrevisions in the estima
tes of the potential liabilities could ha ve a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.Results of Operations
Impact of Acquisitions
The comparability of our op
erating results in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our recentacquisitions. In our discussion of 
changes in our results of operations fro m fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, we mayqualitatively disclos
e the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our operating segments’ rev
enues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our resultsof operations. When mate
rial, we may also provide quantitative disclosur es related to such acquired products and services. Expenses for each of the respectiveperiod comparisons genera
lly were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our 
results of operations during the periods presented.We caution readers th
at, while pre- and post-acquisition compa risons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, anyacquisition informat
ion that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 
 
• any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force 
integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not beenintegrated, the rel
ative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and 
 
• although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software licenseupdates and product support contr
acts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardwaresupport contracts, the amoun
ts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and product support defe rred revenues, andhardware support deferred 
revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarily indicative ofrevenue improvements we wil
l achieve upon contract renewals to th e extent customers do not renew.Constant Currency Presentation
Our international opera
tions have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our segments’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each segment’s 
revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against majorinternational curr
encies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses perfor med excluding the effects of foreign currencyfluctuations, we compare 
the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To presentthis 
information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constantexchange rates (i.e., th
e rates in effect on May 31, 2015, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather t han the actual exchange rates in effect during therespective periods. For exa
mple, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2016 and 2015, our financialstatements would refle
ct reported revenues of $1.12 million in fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.08 million infiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as the month
-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presen tation, however, would translate the fiscal 2016 resultsusing the fiscal 2015 exchange 
rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percentchange 
based on actual, unrounded resul ts in reported currency and in constant currency.

Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements ininternational 
currencies relat ive to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points andtotal operating marg
in by 7 percentage points.Excluding the effects of un
favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and on- premise software business r
evenues and services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues duringfiscal 2016 was attributab
le to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and Ia aS revenues, and revenuecontributions from our re
cent acquisitions and was partially offset by fiscal 2016 decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The constant currency growth inour 
services business revenues was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 werepartially offset by cons
tant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, the EMEA reg ion and the Asia Pacific region contributedapproximately equal a
mounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas was flat.Excluding the effects of
 favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales andmarketing and resear
ch and development expenses resulting prima rily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting fromincreased headcount and in
frastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher restructuring expenses th at wererecorded pursuant to the Fisc
al 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in this Annual Report), 
and higher general and administrative expens es due to higher headcount and higher professional services fees, primarily legalrelated fees. These cons
tant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully a
mortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which primarily was attributable to higher expenses during fiscal2015 as a result of a goodwill imp
airment loss of $186 million (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financia l Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Reportfor additional information).

Excluding the effects of  unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, hardware support revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 du
e to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines for which we offer hardware support. This decrease waspartially offset by incremental re
venues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 th at were primarily related to our acquisition of MICROS. On a constant currencybasis, the decrease in to
tal hardware support revenues was attributable to revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2016.Excluding the effects of 
favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total hardware support expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to reductions in employee r
elated and other expenses from reduced headcount and reduced external contractor costs as we integrated MICROS into our operations,due to a decrease in bad deb

Fiscal 2015 
Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Excluding the effects of un favorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware support revenues increased in fiscal 2015primarily due to incremental reve

contributed 6% to the increase in hardware support revenues during fiscal 2015.In constant currency, tot
al hardware support expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and adecrease in amorti

Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes:     
Our effective tax ra te in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range ofincome tax rates. The prov
ision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinit
ely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities and the U.S.domestic production act
ivity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affect ed if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we havelower statutory tax rat
es, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     
Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015 increased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014, due insubstantial 
part to an unfavorable ch ange in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal 2015 earnings, and due to the effects of acquisition related settlements with taxauthorities in fisca
l 2014 that were not present in fiscal 2015, which together were partially offset by lower fiscal 2015 in come before provision for income taxes.Liquidity and Capital Resources

The decrease in working capi tal as of May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to $10.4 bil lion of cash used forrepurchases of our common sto
ck, $2.5 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and $1.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures. Theseunfavorable working 
capital movements wer e partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016and cash proceeds from fis
cal 2016 stock option exercises.The increase in working capi
tal as of May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes during fiscal 2015, the favor
able impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2015 and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stockoption exercises. These working c
apital increases were partially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash used for ou r acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion ofcash used for repurchases of ou
r common stock, the reclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes that were due in January 2016 from long-term to current, and$2.3 billion of cash used to pay divid
ends to our stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2015.Our working capital may be imp

Table of ContentsCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:     
Cash and cash equivalents primari ly consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper andother securities with ori
ginal maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other secur
ities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to cashinflows generated by our opera
tions during fiscal 2016, $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fisc al 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflowsfrom fiscal 2016 stock option 
exercises. These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2016 cash outflows of $10.4 billion for repurchases of our common stock, $2.5 billion for th
e fiscal 2016 payment of cash dividends to our stockholders, and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016 capital expenditures. Cash, cashequivalents and market
able securities included $48.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2016. We cons ider $42.6 billion of our undistributedearnings as indefinite
ly reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax ifrepatriated 
to the United States. Assuming a ful l utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earningswould be approximately $13.3 bill
ion as of May 31, 2016 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount o f cash, cash equivalents andmarketable securi
ties that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreignsubsidiaries is 
subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offsetto which is substantially re
corded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also p resented as a line item in ourconsolidated statemen
ts of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain majorinternational curr
encies during fiscal 2016, the amount of c ash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiariesdecreased on a net basis as o
f May 31, 2016 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2015 balance shee t date.The increase in cash, cash 
equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was due to an increase in c ash generated from ourfiscal 2015 operating ac
tivities, our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2015 stock optionexercises. These 
fiscal 2015 cash inflows were pa rtially offset by fiscal 2015 cash outflows of $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS andothers, $8.1 billion of fisca
l 2015 repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and $2.3 billion used fo r the payment of fiscal2015 cash dividends to our stockholders. Addi
tionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2015 decreased on anet basis in comparison to 
May 31, 2014 as the U.S. Dollar generally st rengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2015.Days sales 
outstanding, which we calculat e by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 46 days at May 31, 2016compared with 47 days at May 31, 2015. The days s
ales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resu lting from businesscombinations that reduc
ed our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware supportobligations to fair value.

contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of newsoftware licenses, cloud SaaS and Pa
aS offerings, hardware products, hardware support arrangements, and servi ces. Our primary uses of cash from operatingactivities are for employee related e
xpenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities.

To supplement our statemen ts of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4 -quarter basisto analyze cash flows gener

The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternati

Table of ContentsLong-Term Customer Financing:     
We offer certain o f our customers the option to acquire our softwar e products, hardware products and services offeringsthrough separate long-term
 payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financialinstitutions within 90 days of the 
contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales offinancing receivabl
es because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing rec eivables. We financed $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and $1.6billion in each of fisc
al 2015 and 2014, or approximately 16%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.We 
financed $159 million, $172 million and $168 million of our hardware products revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 6% ineach of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 of our h
ardware products revenues.Recent Financing Activities:
Revolving Credit Agreement 
:    In May 2016, we entered into thr ee revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agen
t (the 2016 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capi
tal and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2016 Cr edit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formulaor (2) the Base Rate formul
a, each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the termination date of the 2016 Credit Agreements. Addit
ional details regarding the 2016 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded elsewhere in this Annua
l Report.Senior Notes 
:    In January 2016, our $2.0 billion 5.25% sen ior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid.Cash Dividends 
:    In fiscal 2016, we declar ed and paid cash dividends of $0.60 per share that totaled $2.5 billion. In June 2016, our Board of Directors decla red aquarterly cash dividend of $0.15 p
er share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 27, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July6, 2016. Future declarations of div
idends and the establishment of fu ture record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Common Stock 
Repurchases :    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 15, 2016, weannounced that our Board of Direc
tors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2016, approximately$8.8 billion remained ava
ilable for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion, 193.7million shares for $8.1 
billion, and 280.4 million shar es for $9.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does nothave an expiration date 
and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash r equirements for acquisitions anddividend payments, our debt rep
ayment obligations (described further below) or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Ourstock repurchases may be 
effected from ti me to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may beaccelerated, suspended, d
elayed or discontinued at any time.

Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2016 after considering:  
 
• certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectivelybecame variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interes
t payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and are subject to change in futu
re periods; 
 
•  interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31, 2016 and are subject to change in future periods; and  
 
• certain cross-currency swap agreements for a series of our Euro denominated senior notes that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual intere stpayments and the payment of principal at 
maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the term
s of these cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for our other Euro-denominated senior notes presented in the contractualobligations table above were estimated 
using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2016 and are subject to change in future periods.

Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activit ies. We have approximately$54 million in facility obl
igations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2016. 
 
Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, m inimum or variable priceprovisions; and the approximate t
iming of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain 
individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments arebased on our forecasted component and 
manufacturing requirements and typ ically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part orproduct and have been included in the amount presented in 
the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangement s for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers andcertain other suppliers and that a
re entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered in to in order to secure pricing or othernegotiated terms and are difficu
lt to quantify in a meaningful way.In June 2016, we acquired certa
in companies to expand our cloud industry solutions offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. In theaggregate, the estimated total 
preliminary purchase price was $1.3 billion. As of May 31, 2016, we had $5.3 billion of gross unrecogni
zed income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on ou r consolidated balancesheet, and all such obligat
ions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannotmake a reasonably reliable 
estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant taxauthorities, although we bel
ieve it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fisca l 2017.

Table of ContentsWe believe that our current ca

Selected Quarterly Financial Data
Quarterly revenues, expenses 
and operating income have historically been affected by  a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentivecompensation plans. In addit
ion, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These s
easonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues ascompared to revenues in th
e immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historica lly has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly,the operating income of ou
r business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud software and on-premise software segment) as certain 
expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2017.The following tables set for
th selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consistedonly of normal recurring 
adjustments, have been included in the a mounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with theconsolidated financia
l statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial informa tion may vary from annualdata due to rounding.

Our stock-based compensation prog
ram is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees andalign their interes
ts with the interests of existing stockholders.  
75

Table of ContentsWe recognize that r
estricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of s tock-based awardsgranted while providing compe
titive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2013 has been aweighted-average annual
ized rate of 1.6% per year. The potential d ilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards orstock options granted and assumed, n
et of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted- average outstanding shares du
ring the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stockoptions are exercised. Of th
e outstanding stock options at May 31, 2016, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, 13.3% have exercise prices higher thanthe market price of ou
r common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; howeve
r, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future, as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to paydividends, to repay or repurch
ase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2016, the maximum potentia l dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-basedawards and unexercised stock opt
ions, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike priceis 
higher than the market price as of such date, was 10.3%.The Compensation Committee of 
the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock-b ased award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to execut
ive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate PlanCommittee, which 
is an executive offic er committee, approves individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non- executive officers 
and employees. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 is summarized as follows(shares in millions):

Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronouncements
For information with respec
t to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 ofNotes to Consolidated Financial Sta
tements included elsewhere in this Annua l Report.Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative 
Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk
Our bank deposits and time deposits 
are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that mee
t investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2016, substantiallyall of our marketabl
e securities are high quality with approximately 28% having maturity dates wi thin one year and 72% having maturity dates within one to sixyears (a description of ou
r marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capit
al Resources” above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debtsecurities are impacted by intere
st rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as o f May 31, 2016, we estimate the changewould have decreased the fa
ir values of our marketable securities holdings by $282 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to ourinvestments portfolio as
sociated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generallydo not use our investments for t
rading purposes.Changes in the o
verall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2016, total interest inco
me was $538 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.16% on a worldwide basis. Thetable below presents the app
roximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for ourinvestment portfolio a

— Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOur total borrowings were $43.9 billion 
as of May 31, 2016, consisting of $37.8 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of 
short-term borrowings under a revolving credit agreement (Short-Term Borrowings). 
77

Table of ContentsWe have entered into certain i
nterest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest oblig ations associated with our $1.5 billionof 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (J
anuary 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5billion of 2.80% senior notes due 
July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the int erest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. Thecritical terms o
f the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, and July 2021 Notes that the inte rest rateswap agreements pertain 
to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowingsfor trading purposes. We ar
e accounting for these interest r ate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives
and
Hedging
 (ASC 815). The total fair value g
ain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2016 was $122 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2016, 
the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $185 million.Additional details rega
rding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual Report.By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and th
e Short-Term Borrowings, and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumedrisks associated with vari
able interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2016, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes,Short-Term Borrowings and January 2019 Notes, Octob
er 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes, after considering the effects of the aforementioned inte rest rate swaparrangements, was 1.14%. Changes in th
e overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest raterisk sensitivity analysis 
is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.As of May 31, 2016, if LIBOR-based interest ra
tes would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annua lly byapproximately $76 mill
ion as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings.Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk 
— Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in va
rious foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contra cts to offset the risksassociated with the eff
ects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or decreas
es in our foreign currency exposures are of fset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolatility associat
ed with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typica lly arise fromintercompany sublicense 
fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term induration.
Neither do we use these foreign 
currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair va
lues of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues recorded to our consol
idated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward cont racts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. Thebalance sheet classification for
 the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current 
liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values ofthese forward contracts 
is non-operating income (expense), net for both realized and unreal ized gains and losses. 
78

Table of ContentsWe expect that we will con
tinue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forwardcontracts. Our ultimat
e realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactionsthat we enter into, the 
currency exchange rat es associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currencyforward contracts and othe
r factors. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchang e forother major interna
tional currencies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of forward contracts weheld to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange 
for other major inte rnational currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstandingforeign currency forward 
contracts were nominal at May 31, 2016 and 2015. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income ( expense),net in the accompanying conso
lidated statements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Included in the net fore
ign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were for eign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelansubsidiary’s operations of $7 m
illion, $23 million and $213 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additiona
l information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currencyvolatility in the futu
re, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Fluctuations in foreign cur
rencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, 
the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cashheld by these subsidiaries is sub
ject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign curren cy exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period(the offset to which is substan
tially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statemen
ts of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated agains
t certain international currencies as  of the end of fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat we reported in U.S. Dollars for 
foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2016 decreased relative to what we would have r eportedusing a constant currency r
ate as of May 31, 2015. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on ourreported cash and cash equiv
alents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were de creases of $115 million, $1.2 billion and $158 million,respectively. The following 
table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies th
at we held as of May 31, 2016: 
(in millions)

   Total cash, cash equivalen

   If overall foreign cu
rrency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equival ents andmarketable securi
ties we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $680 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cashequivalents and marketable 
securities balances.

Table of ContentsForeign Currency Translation Risk 
— Net Investment HedgeIn July 2013, we issued €750 million of 3.125% sen
ior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certa
in of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity causedby the changes in foreign cur
rency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a resu lt, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge,the change in the carry
ing value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumula
ted other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income in
cluded elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $25 million of net other co mprehensive losses for fiscal 2016. Any remaining changein the carrying value of 
the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net.We 
did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2016.Fluctuations in the exchange 
rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will requ ire to settle the July 2025 Notes atmaturity. If the U.S. Dollar would hav
e been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2016, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principalportion of 
the July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have incre ased by approximately $84 million.Item

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period cover
ed by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of ourDisclosure Committee and our 
management, including our Principal Execu tive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of thedesign and operation of our disc
losure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls are pro cedures thatare designed to ensure tha
t information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Disclosure controls are a
lso designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Princ
ipal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation ofdisclosure controls includ
es an evaluation of some components of our internal control ove r financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation ofinternal control over 
financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below.The evaluation of our disclosu
re controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generat
ed for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identifiedand sought to confirm that app
ropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were b eing undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on aquarterly basis so that th
e conclusions of management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), concerning theeffectiveness of the d
isclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controlsare also evaluated on an ongo
ing basis by both our internal audit and finance organizations. The overal l goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitorour disclosure controls and to 
modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust ascircumstances merit.

Table of ContentsBased on our management’s eva
luation (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financia l Officer), as of the end ofthe period covered by this r
eport, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under th
e supervision and with the parti cipation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is ourPrincipal Financial Officer)
, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 based on the guidelines established in 
Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013framework. Our internal con
trol over financial reporting includes polic ies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Based on the results of our evalu
ation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2016. We reviewed the results of managem
ent’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.The effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as sta
ted in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred du
ring our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control overfinancial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our 
Principal Executive Offi cers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and proceduresand internal control ove
r financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at t he reasonable assurancelevel. However, our managemen
t does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errorsand all fraud. A control 
system, no matter how well conc eived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controlsystem are met. Further,
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benef its of controls must be consideredrelative to their 
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues andinstances of fraud, 
if any, have been detect ed. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdownscan occur because of a si
mple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some pe rsons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management ove
rride of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood offuture events and there 
can be no assurance that any design wil l succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls maybecome inadequate bec
ause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the  inherent limitationsin a cost-effective control s
ystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B.    Other Information

The Board of Directors and Stockholde
rs of Oracle CorporationWe have audited Oracle Corpo
ration’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tr eadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation’smanagement is responsible
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of int ernal control overfinancial reporting 
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinionon the company’s internal 
control over financial reporting b ased on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standa rds require that we planand perform the audit to
 obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Ouraudit included obtaining 
an understanding of interna l control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating thedesign and operating effe
ctiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we conside red necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A 
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accordance wit
h generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expend itures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of manag
ement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its 
inherent limitat ions, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future perio
ds are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, Oracle Corporation 
maintained, in all m aterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, based on the COSOcriteria.
We 
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets ofOracle Corporation as of May 31, 2016 and 2015,

Basis of Financial Statements
The consolidated financi
al statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions ofcertain of our consolidate
d entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for all per iodspresented. The noncontrolling 
interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been includedas a component of non-operat
ing income (expense), net in our consolidated state ments of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.Certain other prior yea
r balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income.
Included in acquisition r
elated and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for fisca l 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition relatedbenefit of $19 million and 
a litigation related benefit of $53 million, respectively. Further, acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 included $186million related to 
a goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional information).In fiscal 2016, we adopted Accounting St

om our historical presentation whereby certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder wereclassified as non-curr
ent. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-17, current deferred tax assets of $663 million and current deferred tax liabilities of $85 million in our May31, 2015 cons
olidated balance sheet were reclassified as non-current and certain related reclassification entries were also recorded.In addition, in fiscal 2016, we a

Our consolidated financia
l statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the FinancialAccounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting 
Standards Codification (ASC), and we conside r the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicableguidance issued by the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the 
estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that theseestimates, judgments and 
assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dateof the financial sta
tements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences betweenthese estimates, judgm
ents or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of aparticular transa
ction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’sjudgment in selecting amo
ng available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of 
revenues include:  
 
• cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, app
lications and industry-specific software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broadrange of our software and re
lated support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud comput ing environment; cloud IaaSofferings, which grant custom
ers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services, and also providemanagement services 
for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure, both generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates andproduct support offerings (des
cribed further below); 
 
• hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networkingand 
data center fabric products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and 
 
• services revenues, which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support andeducation 
services. Revenues generally are r
ecognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Servic
es (Software Elements)New software licenses revenues p
rimarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-sp ecificsoftware products and exclude 
cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updatesand product support revenues. The bas
is for our new software licenses revenu e recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC985-605, 
Software-Revenue
Recognition.
 We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services r
evenues to be recognized in each accounting period.For software license arr
angements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licensesrevenues when: (1) we enter in
to a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed ordeterminable and free of conti
ngencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because theforegoing conditions are not 
met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequent ly met.Substantially all of our sof
tware license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance prov isions exist as part of public policy (forexample, in agreemen
ts with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that arereferenced in the current 
agreement and are short-term in  nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctoryand all other revenue r
ecognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions th at are long-term innature or are not include
d as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration ofthe acceptance period.
The vast majority of our sof
tware license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related f
ees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights tounspecified software produc
t upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access totechnical content, as we
ll as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentag
e of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of ourcustomers renew their sof
tware license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into a
rrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same ti me, or withinclose proximity of one
 another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include thesale of our software products, so
ftware license updates and product support contr acts and other software related services whereby software license delivery isfollowed by the subsequent or conte
mporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to dete
rmine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair valueexists for undelivered eleme
nts in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of thearrangement consideration ge
nerally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element 
arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remainingamount allocated to th
e software license.

Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support 
and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our revenue recognition poli
cy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware p roducts, support and related services isbased upon the accounting guidanc
e contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue
Recognition
 , Multiple-Element
Arrangements,
and we exercise judgment and use estimates in 
connection with the deter mination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, support and related servicesrevenues to be recognized 
in each accounting period.Revenues from the sales of our non
-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to 
the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at thetime of sale because 
the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequent ly met. When applicable, we reduce revenues forestimated returns or certain ot
her incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subjectto acceptance criteria and the accepta
nce provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included asstandard terms of an arran
gement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance  or expiration of the acceptance period.Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings genera
lly provide customers access to certain of our software wi thin a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host andsupport and offer to custome
rs on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract termcommencing with the date
 the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.Our cloud 
IaaS offerings provide inf rastructure cloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related ITinfrastructure. Our cloud 
IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably overthe contract term commencing 
with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.Revenues from the sale of ha
rdware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,networking and industry-specif
ic hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognitioncriteria have been satisfied.
Our hardware support offerings gen
erally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of ourhardware products and can also 
include product repairs, maintenanc e services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as apercentage of the net h
ardware products fees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably ove r the contractualterm of the arrange
ments, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.Revenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services(Non-software Arrangements)
We enter into arrang
ements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as no
n-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as aseparate unit of accountin
g provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have va lue to the customer on a standalone basis; and for anarrangement that includes a 
general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service isconsidered probable and is subst
antially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us oranother vendor or could be reso
ld by the customer. Further, our revenue

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
arrangements generally do 
not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit ofaccounting are not met, 
the deliverable is combin ed with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of thearrangement consider
ation and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit ofaccounting, we generally r
ecognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenuesover the contractual 
term of the cloud software subscription. For the purpos es of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit ofaccounting, we allocate 
revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our bes
t estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.For our non-software 
multiple-element arrangements, we  allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. Theselling price for ea
ch element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, orestimated selling pr
ice (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangiblehardware product includes sof
tware, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essentialfunctionality and, if so, th
e entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each sep arate unit ofaccounting for each of th
e non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit theamount of revenue recogni
zed for delivered elements to an amount th at is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of anyspecified performan
ce conditions.When possible, we establish VSOE of selling p
rice for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for adeliverable when sold separ
ately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPEis established by evaluat
ing similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we areunable to determine th
e selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewinghistorical transac
tions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a s tandalone basis and considering several other external and internal factorsincluding, but not limited 
to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the 
type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of theproduct lifecycle. The d
etermination of ESP is made through consultation with and approv al by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model andgo-to-market strat
egy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our det
ermination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differmaterially from ou
r results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in ourselling prices.
Revenue Recognition Policies 
Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements Revenue Recognition for Multipl
e-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elemen tsWe also enter into multiple-element
 arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and servicesofferings including new softwar
e licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardwaresupport, consulting, advanced custo
mer support services and educat ion. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on therelative selling pr
ices of the software group of elements as a whole and 
95

Table of ContentsORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
to the non-software elem
ents. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidancein ASC 985-605 and our policies 
as described above. After th e arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respectiveelement in the arr
angement as described above.Other Revenue Recognition Policies Appl
icable to Software and Non-software ElementsMany 
of our software arrangem ents include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part ofour services business. Consulting rev
enues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from n ew software licenses revenues because thearrangements qualify 
as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should beaccounted for separately 
include the nature of se rvices (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degreeof risk, availability o
f services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software licensefee. Revenues for co
nsulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion orreceipt of payment 
for the consulting servic es, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance oncontracts with fixed or “no
t to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of tot al estimated hours to complete the project. Ifwe do not have a sufficient bas
is to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that theservices have been 
completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based uponan average fully burdened d
aily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation  process and factors relatingto the assumptions, risks and unce
rtainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues andrelated expenses repor
ted in our consolidated financial  statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates,utilization and efficiency variance
s and specification and testing requirement changes.Our advanced customer support se
rvices are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We of
fer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higheravailability of the
ir products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from t hese services are recognized as the services areperformed or ratably ov
er the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.Education revenues are a
lso a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software andhardware products. Education r
evenues are recognized as the class es or other education offerings are delivered.If an arrangement con
tains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting fo r the product and service transactions, then new software licensesrevenues and/or hardware produ
cts revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contractaccounting using either
 the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accountedfor as a single unit of ac
counting, we allocate revenues to software and non-software elements based on a rat ional and consistent methodology utilizing our bestestimate of the relative selling 
price of such elements.We also 
evaluate arrangem ents with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions arerequired by law, to determ
ine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple fa ctors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions,the “essential use” of 
the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes 
96

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
undertaken by the government
al entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognizerevenues once all of the 
criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt orapproval of the applicab
le funding provision by the governmental entity.We assess whether fees
 are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are ne
t 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard paymentterms based on whether we have suc
cessful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics)and, if so, generally conclud
e such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.While most of our arrang
ements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers pr
imarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history ofcollection, without concess
ions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to fiv e years from the contract date. Provided all other revenuerecognition criter
ia have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of anypayment discounts from fin
ancing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-partyfinancing institutions with
in 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds f rom these sales as cash flows from operating activities in ourconsolidated statemen
ts of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers
and
 Servicing
 , as we are considered to have surrende
red control of these financing receivables. We sold $1.8 billion of our financing receivables to financial institutions during each offiscal 2016 and 2015, and $2.0 billion dur
ing fiscal 2014.Our customers include sever
al of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our produ
cts to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services thatoccur within a three-mon
th time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that s ame customer are reviewed for appropriate accountingtreatment and disclosu
re. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms weconsider to 
be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are metand the goods and services acqui
red are necessary for our current operations.Business Combinations
We apply the 
provisions of ASC 805, Business
Combinations
 , in accounting for our acquis itions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired and the liabi
lities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is me asured as the excess of consideration transferredover the net of the acquis
ition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue assets 
acquired and liabilities ass umed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertainand subject to refinem
ent. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisi tion date, we record adjustments to the assetsacquired and liabili
ties assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values ofassets acquired or 
liabilities assumed, whi chever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. 
97

Costs to exit or re
structure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as term ination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420,Exit
or
Disposal
Cost
Obligations
, and are accounted for sep arately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activityis 
recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fairvalue of facility restructuring
 activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actualresults. This may require us 
to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision ismade.
For a given acquisition, we may id
entify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre- acquisition contingenci
es throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part ofthe fair value estimates of as
sets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determ ine their estimated amounts.If we cannot reasonably det
ermine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax rela ted) by the end of the measurement period, which isgenerally the case giv
en the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted 
or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to themeasurement period, ch
anges in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material e ffect on our results of operations and financialposition.
In addition, uncertain t
ax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connec tion with a business combination are initially estimated as of theacquisition date. We r
eevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estim
ates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination ofthe tax allowance’s or con
tingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these unc ertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances willaffect our provision for 
income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
In accordance with ASC 320, 
Investments
 — Debt
and
Equity
Securities,
and based on our intentions rega rding these instruments, we classify substantially all ofour marketable debt and 
equity securities as available-f or-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, withall unrealized gains 
(losses) reflected net of tax in stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and as a l ine item in our consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income. If 
we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operatingincome (expense), net 
in the accompanying co nsolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges arerequired. Substantially a
ll of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investme nts and their availability foruse in current operations.
We hold investments in
 certain non-marketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities arerecorded at cost and inc
luded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of these non-marketable securities, we determ
ine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323,Investments
— Equity
Method
and
Joint
Ventures
 , to account for such investments .
 Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews.Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We 
apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair
Value
Measurement
 (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilit ies that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant toother accounting standards, 
including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivati ve financial instruments.The additional disclosures 
regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We record allowances fo
r doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,provisions are provided at di
ffering rates, based upon the age of the rec eivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable wasrecorded in and current 
economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection effortswithout success.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that
 are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivativesand trade receivabl
es. Our cash and cash equivalents are gen erally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to anysingle financial institution
. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investm ent-grade securities. Ourderivative contracts are transacted
 with various financial institutions with high credit standings. We generally do not require collateral to secure accountsreceivable. The risk with 
respect to trade receivables is mit igated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms forthe significant majo
rity of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
We outsource the design, manu
facturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a va riety of companies, many of which are located outsidethe United States. Further, we have s
implified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number oflocations 
where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to fulfill orders for ourhardware products could advers
ely impact future operating results of our hardware business.Inventories
Inventories are 
stated at the lower of cos t or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis.We evaluate our ending inv
entories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes ana lysis of sales levels by product and projections offuture demand within speci
fic time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardwareproducts expenses. 
In addition, we assess the impa ct of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At thepoint of loss recognition, a new, lowe
r-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and cir cumstances do not result in the restorationor increase in that newly 
established cost basis.Other Receivables
Other receivables rep
resent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses 
and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $816 million and $817 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We defer 
sales commission expenses asso ciated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable term ofthe related contra
cts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketingexpenses in our consolidated st
atements of operations.

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment 
are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-linemethod based on estimated us
eful lives of the assets, which range fro m one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimateduseful lives of the improv
ements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever ev ents orchanges in circumstances i
ndicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment chargesin fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assetsthat are not considered 
to have an indefinite useful li fe are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluatethe estimated rem
aining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods ofamortization.
The carrying amounts of our goodwil
l and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairm ent (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets) and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. According to ASC 350, Intangibles —
Goodwill
and
Other
, we can opt to perform a qual itative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-stepimpairment test. Based on ou
r qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50percent) to be less than 
its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting un it to itscarrying value. If the 
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and weare not required to per
form further testing. If the carrying value o f the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then wemust perform the second st
ep of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the car rying value of a reportingunit’s goodwill exceeds its i
mplied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We did not recognize any goodwill impairmentcharges in fiscal 2016 or 
2014. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a $186 million goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional information).Recoverability of fini
te lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. Re
coverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the assetis considered to be impai
red, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference be tween the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Wedid not recognize any intang
ible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Derivative Financial Instruments
During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we used deriva
tive and non-derivative financial instr uments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 11below for additional infor
mation). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives
and
Hedging
 (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrumen
t be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires thatchanges in our derivatives
’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless s pecific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments areaccounted for as hedges).

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
The accounting for changes in 
the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resu lting designation. For a derivative instrumentdesignated as a fair va
lue hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged isrecognized in 
earnings with an offset re corded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, eachreporting period we record 
the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other co mprehensive loss in our consolidated balancesheets, and an amount is rec
lassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk beinghedged. For the 
non-derivative financ ial instrument designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries, the changeon account of remeasure
ment of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other co mprehensive loss in our consolidated balancesheets.
We perform the eff
ectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions of the derivatives, if any,are recognized imm
ediately in earnings.Legal Contingencies
We are currently 
involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure. A description of our ac
counting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided und er “BusinessCombinations” above. For legal and o
ther contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for anestimated loss if the po
tential loss from any claim or l egal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below providesadditional informat
ion regarding certain of our legal contingencies.Shipping and Handling Costs
Our 
shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware products expenses for all periods presented.Foreign 
Currency We transact business in va
rious foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of opera
tions outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities ofoperations outside the United St
ates are translated into U.S. Dollars using ex change rates at the balance sheet date. The effects of foreign currency translationadjustments are includ
ed in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance she ets andrelated periodic movements are 
summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction lossesincluded in non-operating in
come (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated s tatements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million infiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectiv
ely.Stock-Based Compensation
We account for share-b
ased payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs),service-based employe
e stock options, and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation
 — Stock
Compensation,which requires that share
-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fairvalues and the estimat
ed number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compens ation expense on a straight-line basisover the service period 
for each separately vesting tranche, which is generally twelve months, as the performance conditions to evaluate attainment of each tranchefor each participan
t are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. The amount of stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures,recorded as of the end of

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
each annual reporting pe
riod is based on the actual attainment of performance targets. During our interim reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense isrecorded based on expected 
attainment of performance targets.  Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets are reflected in theamount of stock-based compens
ation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each interim reporting pe riod in which suchestimates are al
tered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock
-based compensation expense, net of forfeitu res, on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generallyfour years.
We record deferred 
tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-basedcompensation recognized 
and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutorytax rate in the jurisd
iction in which we will receive a tax deduction.Advertising
All advertising costs are 
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $68 million, $55 million and $79 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, 
respectively.Research and Development and Software Development Costs

We account for income 
taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income
Taxes
 . Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporarydifferences between th
e tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuationallowance to reduce our de
ferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is applied pursu
ant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to dete
rmine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, includingresolution of any relat
ed appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to berealized upon ultimate settlement.
 We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.

ASU 2016-12 collectively, Topic 606). Topic 606 sup ersedes nearly all existing revenuerecognition guidance under GAAP. The core p
rinciple of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in anamount that reflec
ts the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principleand, in doing so, it is possible more 
judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recogni tion process than are required under existing GAAP,including identifying per
formance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating thetransaction price to 
each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarterof fiscal 2019 using either o
f two methods: (1) retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior repor ting period presented with the option to elect certainpractical expedien
ts as defined within Topic 606 or (2) retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 recognizedat the date of initi

aforementioned adoption method (1) and we do not believe there will b e a material impact to our revenues upon adoption. We arecontinuing to evaluate th
e impacts of our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.

ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions
In June 2016, we acquired certa

During fiscal 
2016, we acquired certain co mpanies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and servicesofferings. These acquisit

Acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc.
On June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreemen
t and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integratedsoftware, hardware and servi
ces solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. On July 3, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offerto purchase all of the issu
ed and outstanding shares of common stock of MICROS at a purchase price of $68.00 per sha re, net to the holder in cash, without interestthereon, based upon the terms 
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Between September 3, 2014 and September 8, 2014, pursuant to theterms of 
the tender offer, we ac cepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding shares of MICROS common stock. On September 8, 2014, weeffectuated the m
erger of MICROS with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Marylandlaw, and MICROS became an indirect, wholly
-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Pursuant to the merger, shares of MICROS common stock that remained outstandingand were not acquired by us were conv
erted into, and cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive $68.00 per share in cash. The unvested equity awards toacquire MICROS common stock that were ou
tstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on 
formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquired MICROS to, among other things, expand our cloud and on-premisesoftware, hardware and rel
ated services offerings for hotels, food and beverage industries, facilities, and  retailers. We have included the financial results ofMICROS in our consolidated financial s

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We perform fair 
value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in an or
derly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value meas urements for assets andliabilities requi
red to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptionsthat market parti
cipants would use when pricing the assets or l iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC 820 establishes a 
fair value hierar chy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring fair value. A
n asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of inpu t that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establ

•  Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 
• Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical
 or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated byobservable market dat
a for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or  
 
•  Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Pursuant to our business combinat
ions accounting policy, we recorded goodwill adjustments for the ef fects on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the period that such a change is identified,provided that any such change is within the measu
rement period (up to one year from the date of the acquisition). 
During fiscal 2015, we recorded a $186 million goodwil
l impairment loss to our hardware products report ing unit. We considered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware productsreporting unit as of March 1, 2015 and concluded the 
most appropriate to be the income approach. The fair value of our hardware products reporting unit pur suant to the income approach was impacted bylower forecasted operating result
s for this reporting unit, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in hardware products research and development activities. We compared the implied fair value of goodwill 
in our hardware products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in the $186 million goodwill impairment loss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwillfor our hardware products reporting uni
t. The aggregate hardware products reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems,Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, 
Inc. Such impairment loss was recorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations. We did not recognizeany goodwill impairment losses 
in fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2014.

rating segments.

s) and the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variablebased on LIBOR. The effective interest rates after con
sideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were 1.28% and 0.93% for the January 2019 Notes, 1.11% and 0.76% for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.26% and 0.91% for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. Refer to Notes 1 and 11 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges. 
In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed
-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% sen ior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, 
the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance cos ts for the Euro Notes in the table above were calculated using foreigncurrency exchange rates as of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respect

In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Note
s, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agree ments that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,including annual interest payments and 
the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual intere st rate of 3.53% (see Note 11 for additionalinformation).
 
We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net invest
ment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility instockholders’ equity caused by the changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar (see Note 11 for additional in formation).Senior Notes and Other Borrowings
In January 2016, our $2.0 billion of 5.25% sen
ior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid. In July 2014, our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (July 2014 Notes) matured and were 
repaid (we also settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014 Notes).Interest is payable se
mi-annually for the senior notes except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the floating-rate senior notes for whichinterest is payable qua
rterly. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment ofan applicable make-whol
e premium in certain instances except for the floating-rate senior notes which may not be redeemed prior to their maturity. The senior notes rank pari passu wi

rogram below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of thesubsidiaries of Oracle Corpor

   Total deferred revenues
  $8,191    $7,638    
     
   Deferred software lic
ense updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware support revenues represent customer payments made in advance for supportcontracts that are 
typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred cloudSaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues general
ly resulted from customer payments made in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over thecorresponding contractua
l term. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed
. Deferred new software licenses revenues typically resulted from undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer-specificacceptance provisions, cus
tomer payments made in advance for time-based license arrangements and s oftware license transactions that cannot be separated fromundelivered consulting or oth
er services.In connection 
with our acquisitions, we have est imated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardwaresupport obligations, among others, 
assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obl igations assumed using a costbuild-up approach. The cost build
-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Thesum of the costs and operating 
profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations.These aforementioned f
air value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updat esand product support and hardware suppor
t deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenuesthat we recognized or will 
recognize over the terms of the acquired ob ligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair 
Value Hedges—Interest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2014, we entered into cer
tain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying th e fixed-interest obligations associated with ourOctober 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes so that the 
interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we enteredinto certain 
interest rate swap agr eements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so thatthe interest payable on 
these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate s wap agreements match the criticalterms of the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Not
es and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts andmaturity dates.
We have designated the a
forementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are cha
racterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values ofcertain of our fixed-
rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The  changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized asinterest expense in our conso
lidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance she
ets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements ofoperations with the correspond
ing amount included in notes payable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for theOctober 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Not
es are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities.
In July 2014, we settled the fixed 
to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014 Notes. We do not use any interest rate swap agreementsfor trading purposes.
Cash Flow Hedges—Cross-Currency Swap Agreements
In connection with the issuanc
e of our January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effect
ively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principalat maturity, to fixed
-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agre ements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S.Dollars associated with the J
anuary 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these 
cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC815. The critical ter
ms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes, including the annual int erest payments being hedged, and thecross-currency swap agree
ments mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.We used the hypothetical d
erivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swapagreements are re
cognized as other assets or other non-current liab ilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values ofthese cross-currency swap ag
reements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets, and an amount is reclassi fied outof accumulated other 
comprehensive loss into non-operating income (expense), net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro-denominated January2021 Notes is remeasured and the 
interest expense is recognized. The ineffe ctive portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, isrecorded immediately to non-
operating income (expense), net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffec
tiveness for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that 
116

Table of ContentsORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
pertain to the periodic intere
st settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financingactivities.
We do not use any cross-curren
cy swap agreements for trading purposes.Net Investment Hedge—Foreign Currency Borrowings
In July 2013, we designated our July 
2025 Notes as a net investment hedg e of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as theirfunctional currency in o
rder to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rat es of the Euro with respect to theU.S. Dollar.
We used the spot method to me
asure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this m ethod, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying valueof the Euro-denominated July 2025 Not
es due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the r
emaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of
 operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the b eginning of every quarter. We did not record anyineffectiveness for 
fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Foreign Currency 
Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in va
rious foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currenc y forward contracts to offset the risksassociated with the eff
ects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or 
decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolatility associat
ed with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our fore ign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany sublicense 
fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreigncurrency forward 
contracts are gener ally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on thesize and type of cross-cur
rency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposur es and changes in those rates, the netrealized and unreal
ized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.Neither do we use these foreign 
currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant toASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair 
values of these contrac ts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues recorded to our
 consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid exp enses andother current assets fo
r forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. Thestatement of operations clas
sification for changes in fair values of these fo rward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net, for both realized and unrealizedgains and losses.
As of May 
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the not ional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other majorinternational curr
encies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to s ell U.S. Dollars in exchange forother major interna
tional currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts werenominal at May 31, 2016 
and 2015. Included in our non-operating 
income (expense), net were $97 million, $60 million and $(69) million of net gains (losses) related to these forward contracts for theyears ended May 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respect
ively. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.

Lease commitments included f

mately $54 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for theselocations in our 
consolidated balance she et at May 31, 2016.Rent expense was $283 million, $290 mil
lion and $278 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, net of subl ease income of approximately $45 millionfor each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, 
and $55 million for fiscal 2014. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the lease terms.Unconditional Obligations
In the 
ordinary course of business, we ent er into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify 
terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable p rice provisions; and the approximatetiming of the payment. We
 utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly andtesting of finished hardwar
e products. We also obtain indiv idual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projecteddemand information. Such purch
ase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fu lfillmentwithin agreed upon lead-ti
mes and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routinearrangements for othe
r materials and goods that are not related to our external manufact urers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinarycourse of business are not inc
luded in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2016, our unconditional purchase 
and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):

al instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.Guarantees
Our software, cloud and 
hardware product sales  agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our productsinfringe a third party
’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifi cations and have not accrued anymaterial liabi
lities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifyingcustomers against 
liabilities in the event we  breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amountunder these indemnification
 agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique fa cts and circumstances involvedin each particular agreement.
Our software license and hardwa
re products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicableprogram documentation fo
r a period of one year after delivery. Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be

rds for a period of 90 days from pe rformance of the services.We occasionally are required,
 for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third par ties in the ordinary course of our business including, amongothers, guarantees rel
ated to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effe

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-based 
Compensation Plans Stock Plans
In fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-T
erm Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restrictedstock-based awards, non-qualif
ied stock options and incentive stock options, as we ll as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligibleemployees, officers and d
irectors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board o
f Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000Plan), which extended the ter
mination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015shares. In fiscal 2014, our stockho
lders, upon the recommendation of our Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that maybe 
issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units(RSUs) and performance stock units 
(PSUs). The vesting schedule for RSUs is established by the Compensation Committee and generally requires vesting 25%annually over four years. The v
esting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Committee and currently requires vesting over four fiscal years, ifat all, based on 
performance. Options to purch ase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable as established by theCompensation Committee of th
e Board (generally 25% annually over four years under our current practice) and generally expire no mor e than 10 years from thedate of grant. For each shar
e granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.As of May 31, 2016, the 2000 Plan 
had 47 million unvested RSUs outstanding, 4 mi llion unvested PSUs outstanding and stock options to purchase 367 millionshares of common stock outstand
ing of which 246 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 317 million shares of common stock were available for futur
e awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted 
the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards,including non-qualified sto
ck options, to non-employee dire ctors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’ Plan, 10 million sh
ares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number o f shares of our commonstock reserved for issuanc
e by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and expire nomore than 10 years from th
e date of grant. The Directors’ Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of theBoard to determine the a
mount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as autom
atic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in theDirectors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2016, 
approximately 147,000 unvested RSUs and stock opt ions to purchase approximately 3 million shares of common stock (ofwhich approximately 2 mil
lion were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 1 million shares were ava ilable forfuture stock awards under this p
lan.In connection with certa
in of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted s tock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective stock plans. Thes
e restricted stock-based awards and stock options generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally gr
anted. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 491,000 shares of restricted stock-based awards and stock options to purchase 5 millionshares of common stock were outs
tanding under these plans.

and 3 million PSUs were granted, respectively, which vest upon the attainment of certain performance metrics and ser vice-basedvesting. Based u
pon actual attainment relative to the “target” performance metric, certain participants have the ability to be issued up to 150% of the target numberof PSUs originally granted,

The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the gross difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2016 of $40.20 and the exercise prices for all “in -the-money”options outstanding, excluding tax effec
ts. 
 
The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2016 was approximately $474 mill ionand is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period o
f 2.02 years. Approximately 7 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2016 were not expected to vest.Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valua
tion of Stock AwardsWe estimated the f
air values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their intrinsic values asof the grant dates.
The fair values of our PSUs were also m
easured based upon their intrinsic values as of their respective grant dates. The vesting conditions and related terms of our PSUs were communicated to each pa
rticipating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based uponconsistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal 
metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determ ined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore,these awards met the per
formance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.We estimated the f
air values of our stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair valuesof stock options. Option valuation mod
els, including the Black-Scholes-M erton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock pricevolatility. Changes in the inpu
t assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock opt
ions were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination. The weighted-averageinput assumptions used and result
ing fair values of our stock options were as follows for f iscal 2016, 2015 and 2014:

air value per share  $ 8.49    $ 9.62    $ 7.47  The expected life input 
is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free interest rate input is based on U.S. Treasuryinstruments, the annuali
zed dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors and the volatility input is calculated based onthe implied volatil
ity of our publicly traded options.

a result of option exercises was approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic v
alue of vesting of restricted stock-based awards and options exercised was $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2016, 2015 and2014, respectively. In connec
tion with the vesting of restricted stock-based awards and stock option exercises, the tax benefits realized by us were $311 million,$396 million and $480 million fo
r fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the total tax benefits received, we classified excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $124 million, $244 
million and $250 million as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating activities for fiscal2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We 
have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket value of Oracl
e stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2016, 54 million shares were res erved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 3 mill
ion shares under the Purchase Plan in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans
We offer various defin
ed contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total de fined contribution plan expense was $387 million, $362 million and$357 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 
and 2014, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent y ears as we havehired additional employ
ees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.In the United States, 
regular employees can p articipate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants cangenerally contribute up 
to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the sec tion 402(g)limit as defined by the U.S. Int
ernal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each payperiod, subject to maximu
m aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Or acle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $153 million, $144 million and $134million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, 
respectively.

We also offer non-qualified
 deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual bas e and/or variable compensationuntil retirement or a date specifie
d by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $419million as of May 31, 2016 
and were each approximat ely $408 million as of May 31, 2015 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in theaccompanying consolidated b

ed benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through ouracquisitions or are requ
ired by local regulatory requirem ents. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or intogovernment-managed ac
counts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $95 million, $69 million and $64 million fo
r fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of ourdefined benefit plans as o

 differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which Uni ted States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $42.6billion and $8.3 billion, respe
ctively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transac
tion, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwisetaxable transaction. At M
ay 31, 2016, assuming a full utilization of the foreign ta x credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporarydifferences of undistr
ibuted earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $13.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

Our net deferred tax asse
ts were $1.1 billion and $993 million as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe it is  more likely than not that the net deferredtax assets will be real
ized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in futureyears 
in appropriate tax jur isdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Theamount of net deferred 
tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if esti mates of future taxable income change.The valuation allowance was $1.2 bi
llion and $1.0 billion at May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Substantia lly all of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2016and 2015 relate to tax asse
ts established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of theassociated tax benefi
ts associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuationallowance or the conclusion o
f the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first. At May 31, 2016, we had federal net oper
ating loss carryforwards of approximately $758 million. These losses expire in various years between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2035 and are subjec
t to limitations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion at May 31, 2016, whichexpire between fiscal 2017

tate taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2015. Many issues are at an advanc
ed stage in the examinat ion process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transferpricing, extraterritorial income exem
ptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken.  Other issues are relatedto years with expiring statu

domestic audit issues consid
ered in the aggregate, we believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2016, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related tothese audits could decre
ase (whether by payment, rele ase, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $228 million ($176 million net ofoffsetting tax benefi
ts). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to aud it for thoseperiods. Our U.S. state income tax r
eturns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004 and we are no longer subject to audit forthose periods.
Internationally, tax 
authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe it wasreasonably possible that, as o
f May 31, 2016, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch as $199 million ($74 mil
lion net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricin g. Other issues are related to years withexpiring statutes of li
mitation. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.We believe that we have 
adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financ
ial statement effect thereof. On July 27, 2015, in Altera
Corp.
v.
Commissioner
 , the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion relat ed to the treatmentof stock-based compensation 
expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangem ent. A final decision has yet to be issued by the U.S. Tax Court due to otheroutstanding issues related 
to the case. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. W
e have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriateat this time. We will 
continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our c onsolidated financial statements.We are under audit by the 
IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious challenges and li
tigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, India, Brazil, and Korea, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we h
ave reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result fromexaminations by, or any negoti
ated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial pro ceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of theseexaminations, agreem
ents or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of theseamounts 
is unnecessary, the revers al of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Ifour estimates of the federal,
 state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than t he ultimate assessment, it would result in a furthercharge to expense.

SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280, 
Segment
 Reporting
, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise about which
 separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision make r, or decision-making group, indeciding how to allocate r
esources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officers. We are organizedgeographically and by line o
f business. While our Chief Executive Of ficers evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business managementstructure is the primary ba
sis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed.We have three businesses—c
loud and on-premise software, hardware and services—which are further divided into certain operating segments. Our cloud and on- premise software business is 
comprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, which includes our cloud SaaS and PaaSofferings, (2) cloud IaaS and 
(3) software license updates and product support. Our hardware business is comprised o f two operating segments: (1) hardwareproducts and (2) hardware support. Al
l other operating segments are combined under our services business.

Our cloud software and on-premis
e software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of application and plat form technologies through ourSaaS and PaaS offerings, which are ce
rtain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manageand support, and through the 
licensing of our software produ cts including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, amongothers.
The cloud 
IaaS line of business provides in frastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elasticcompute, storage and networking s
ervices on a subscription basis; and Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are compreh ensive software and hardwaremanagement and maintenance ser
vices for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partnerdata centers or physically 
on-premise at customer facilities. The software license updat
es and product support line of business generates revenues through the sale of software support contracts related to new software licensespurchased by our customers. The sof
tware license updates and product support line of business provides our on-premise software customers with rights to softwareproduct upgrades and 
maintenance releases, patches relea sed, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical supportpersonnel during the support per
iod.The hardware products line of bus
iness provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software,operating systems including 
the Oracle Solaris Operating System and managem ent software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computingenvironments.
Our hardware support line 
of business provides customers with so ftware updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardwareproducts, such as Oracle Solaris 
and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and tech nical support services.Our services business is compris
ed of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting, advanced custome r support services and education services.Our consulting line of business pri
marily provides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initialproduct 
implementation and in tegration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support provides support services, both on-premiseand remote, to our cu
stomers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services and also includ es certain other services.Education services provide 
training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our cloud, on-premisesoftware and hardware offe
rings.We do not track our assets by ope
rating segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.The following table presents su

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard 
Company Litigation On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) filed 
a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corpor ation allegingnumerous causes of action in
cluding breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospectiveeconomic advantage, and vio
lation of the California Unfair Business Prac tices Act. The original plaintiff, Hewlett Packard Company, is now Hewlett PackardEnterprise Company. The compla
int alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its softwa reto run on HP’s Itanium-based serve
rs, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd SettlementAgreement), who was both HP’s former chi
ef executive officer and chairm an of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights andobligations under the Hurd Settl
ement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.Oracle answered the compl
aint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims includingviolation of the Lanham Act. Or
acle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and hadmisrepresented to custo
mers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sough t equitable rescission of the Hurd SettlementAgreement, and other e
quitable and monetary relief.The court 
bifurcated the tri al and tried HP’s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a finalstatement of decision on August 28, 2012, 
finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to cont inue to develop certain of its software products foruse on HP’s Itanium-based servers 
and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing thisdecision. The issues of breach, HP’s pe
rformance, causation and damages, HP’s tort claims, and Oracle’s cross-claims will all be tried before a jury. As of April 8,2013, the trial was stayed pending Or
acle’s appeal of the court’s denial of its an ti-SLAPP motion. On August 27, 2015, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trialcourt’s denial of Oracl
e’s anti-SLAPP motion. The Court of Appeal’s decision became final on September 26, 2015. The matter was remanded to the tria l court forfurther proceedings and t
rial, which began on May 23, 2016. While we believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue tovigorously defend it, we cannot cu
rrently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding thejudicial process and the n
ature of the claims.State of Oregon Litigation
On August 22, 2014, the Attorney General for the St
ate of Oregon, the State of Oregon, and the Oregon He alth Insurance Exchange Corporation, doing business asCover Oregon (Cover Oregon), filed a l
awsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion against Oracle, our then-President and Chief Financial Officer, thr
ee current and two former Oracle employees, and Mythics, Inc. The complaint alleges claims related to the work Oracle performed onOregon’s healthcare exch
ange website and Oregon’s system for delivering health and human services to low-income residents. Thereafter, Cover Oregon wasdissolved, and the Oregon Departmen
t of Consumer and Business Services (the DCBS) continued to assert Cover Oregon’s claims. Also, one of the former Oracleemployees was dismissed from 
the lawsuit. A First Amended Complaint was filed on August 10, 2015.The complaint alleges 
claims against Oracle for fraud, viola tions of Oregon’s False Claims Act, breach of contract, and violations of the Oregon Civil RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organiz
ations Act, and alleges a violation of Oregon’s False Claims Act against each of the individuals. The complaint s eeks monetarydamages, statutory penal
ties, attorneys’ fees and costs, and a permanent injunction prohibiting Oracle from marketing to or entering into a contract with any publiccorporation or agency of th
e State of Oregon. Specifically,  the complaint alleges that Oracle committed fraud by making false statements about the capabilities andfunctionality of its produ
cts and about the amount of time and effort it would take Oracle’s consulting and managed cloud services operations to perform therequested work. It also all
eges that Oracle breached the contracts by failing to provide 
133

Table of ContentsORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
what was required under the cont
racts and failing to perform the services in a professional manner consistent with industry standards. The complaint alleges thatOracle violated Oregon’s 
False Claims Act by making fals e statements in order to obtain payment of invoices and by presenting invoices for payment that werefalse. The claims for v
iolation of Oregon’s Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act allege that Oracle violated the st atute by making falsestatements in writing abou
t the capabilities of Oracle’s products and the functionality and readiness of the healthcare exchange website, by using those falsestatements to obtain th
e signatures necessary to secure the contracts, execute documents, and enable payment, and by using the wires to transmit documentscontaining the alleged
ly false statements. On May 16, 2016, the State of Oregon filed a motion seeking to amend its complaint to add a demand for punitive damages against Oracle 
for the claims alleging fraud and violations of the Oregon Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.The claims against the 
individuals allege that one former employee violated Oregon’s False Claims Act by making false statements that fraudulently induced theState of Oregon to enter into 
its contracts with Oracle, and that the other four employees violated the statute by making false statements in order to get invoicespaid.
Oracle 
responded to the original co mplaint on December 2, 2014, and filed a response to the First Amended Complaint on August 20, 2015. Oracle denied allclaims and allegat
ions and filed counterclaims against the DCBS for breach of contract, quantum
 meruit
(a claim requesting payment f or the value of servicesprovided), and breach of the 
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court granted the State of Oregon’s motion to dismiss Oracle’s claims for breachof contract 
and the breach of the imp lied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On October 26, 2015, Oracle filed its amended response to Plaintiffs’ FirstAmended Complaint and alleged 
counterclaims against the DCBS for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach ofimplied-in-fact contract, 
quantum
meruit
 , and promissory estoppel (a c laim seeking to enforce promises that Oracle relied upon in providing services). The State ofOregon filed a 
motion to dismiss all count erclaims except the causes of action for quantum
meruit
 and promissory estoppel, and on Februa ry 5, 2016 the courtgranted that motion and dis
missed with prejudice Oracle’s claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant o f good faith and fair dealing and breach ofimplied-in-fact 
contract. Oracle seeks monetary damages to compensate it for the value of unpaid services and its attorneys’ fees and costs. Trial is set to begin onJanuary 
10, 2017. We cannot currently es timate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action,and we will continue to vigorously de
fend it.On August 8, 2014, Oracle filed a lawsuit in 
the U.S. District Court, for the District of Oregon in Portland against Cover Oregon. The complaint alleged claims for breach of contract and 
quantum
meruit
 and sought monetary damages to compensate Oracle for the value of unpaid services. On September 8, 2014, Oracle filed aFirst Amended Complaint adding two Stat
e of Oregon agencies as defendants and adding causes of action fo r copyright infringement and breach of the impliedcovenant of good faith and fa
ir dealing. On January 27, 2015, Oracle filed a Second Amended Complaint. Cover Oregon, now the DCBS, is a defendant as to allcauses of 
action; the other sta te agencies are defendants to the cause of action for copyright infringement. In addition to monetary damages, Oracle seeks aninjunction prohibiting inf
ringement of its copyrights. All defendants moved for judgment in their favor, claiming that the state entities have sovereign immunity(that is, they cannot be sued 
in federal court). On November 18, 2015, the court ruled on the motions, holding that two state agencies (Oregon Health Authority andOregon Department of 
Human Services) do not have sovere ign immunity, but that the DCBS does have sovereign immunity. On December 9 and 17, 2015, Oracleand the Oregon parties each 
filed notices of appeal from that decision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has coordinated the two matt ers, and briefing will beginin late April 2016.
On November 12, 2015, Oracle filed a l
awsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of M arion against Oregon’s Governor, Kate Brown, in herofficial capaci
ty. Oracle filed a First Amended Complaint on January 15, 2016. In this lawsuit, Oracle alleges violations of Oregon’s Public Records Law and seeks a court order declar
ing that Governor Brown has violated Oregon’s Public Records Law and compelling compliance with that law. The Governor has moved todismiss the complaint.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2016
 
On January 21, 2016, Oracle filed a l
awsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion against the Stat e of Oregon, by and throughGovernor Kate Brown, Attorney General Ell
en Rosenblum, and three state agencies. In this lawsuit, Oracle seeks to enforce an October 2015 oral agreement toresolve all pending lit
igation between Oracle and the State of Oregon. Th e State of Oregon moved to dismiss the complaint, and on April 28, 2016 that motion wasdenied. Oracle filed a Fi
rst Amended Complaint on June 13, 2016, and Mythics, Inc. was added as a plaintiff.On March 8, 2016, Oracle filed a Compl
aint for a Writ of Mandamus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Sylvia Burwell, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Se
rvices, in her official capacity. In this lawsuit, Oracle alleges that, as to the State of Oregon and the Oregon Health InsuranceExchange, the Secretary f
ailed to exercise her mandatory oversight duties under the Affordable Ca re Act to monitor the integrity and performance of states andstate health insurance excha
nges that receive federal funds. Oracle seeks an order requiring the Secretary to exercise that mandatory duty and (1) direct the State of Oregon to stay or dismiss its lawsui
t against Oracle, and (2) monitor and investigate all work Oregon and its subgrantees and contractors, including Oracle, did onthe health insurance ex
change project to determine what liabilities involving federal funds, if any, have arisen from it.Other Litigation
We are party to various o
ther legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings andclaims that rela
te to acquisitions we have completed or to comp anies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot bepredicted with certa
inty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that ar e materially inexcess of amounts already 
recognized, if any.
