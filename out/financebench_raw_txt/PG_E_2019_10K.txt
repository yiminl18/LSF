PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a publicutility operating in nor
thern and central California. The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905. PG&E Corporation became the holding company of theUtility and its subsidiari
es in 1997. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s operating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, California 94177. PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415) 973-7000.This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo
r PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is a separate entity, withdistinct creditors and 
claimants, and is subject to separate laws, rules, and regulations.At December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had approximately 23,000 regular employees, approximately 12 of which were employees of PG&ECorporation. Of the Utility’s r
egular employees, approximately 15,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three laborunions: the Internationa
l Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1245; the Engineers and Scientists of California (ESC) IFPTE 20; and the ServiceEmployees Internationa
l Union. The collective bargaining agreements currently in effect will expire on December 31, 2021. As part of the bankruptcy plan ofreorganization, the IBEW
 Local 1245, and the Utility reached a tentative agreement to extend the current collective bargaining agreement that is set to expire onDecember 31, 2021 through December 31, 2025. Th
e tentative agreement increases wages annually by 3.75% from 2022 through 2025 and maintains currentcontributions to specifi
ed benefits. The IBEW represents approximately 50% of the Utility’s employee workforce, and supports several areas of the Utility’sbusiness, including gas and elec
tric operations. The Utility plans to work with its other unions, the Engineers and Scientists of California, Local 20, and ServiceEmployees Internationa
l Union, Local 24/7 to negotiate potential contract extensions.13

In 2019, 2018 and 2017, Northern California exp
erienced major wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017Northern California wildfi
res, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Item 7. MD&A, and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.This 2019 Form 10-K contains forward-looking s
tatements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risksthat could affect th
e outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows, see I
tem 1A. Risk Factors and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” above.Chapter 11 Proceedings
On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed for Chapter 11 protection. For more information about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings see Item 7.MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements in Item 8.PG&E Corporation and the Utility suff
ered material losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to thedecision to file for Chapt
er 11 protection. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sability to continue as going 
concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report whichstates certain condi
tions exist which raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to theforegoing. For more informa
tion about these matters, see Item 7. MD&A and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Regulatory Environment 
The Utility’s business is subjec
t to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC. At the federa
l level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements ofother federal, stat
e and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms”section below summarize so
me of the more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility.PG&E Corporation is a “public util
ity holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversightby the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries a
re exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than theobligation to provide acc
ess to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.The California Public Utilities Commiss
ionThe CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions ofservice for the Utili
ty’s electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The CPUC also hasexercised jurisdict
ion over the Utility’s issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility’s electric andnatural gas retail 
customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providingelectric and natur
al gas utility service.14

The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utilitygas and electric fa
cilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $100,000 per day, per violation. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount ofpenalties based on the tot
ality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the numberof persons affected; and 
the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required toconsider the appropriat
eness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu
e citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports. Underthe current gas and ele
ctric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but ifit assesses a penalty for 
a violation, it has the authority to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $100,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million percitation issued. The SED may, at i
ts discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.The SED has the discretion to eith
er address each violation in a distinct citation or to include multiple violations in a single citation regardless of whether theviolations occurred in th
e same incident or are of a similar nature. Penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs arethe responsibility of shar
eholders of an issuer and must not be recovered in rates or otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers.The California State Legis
lature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,increasing renewable en
ergy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHGemissions, the establishm
ent of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The CPUC isresponsible for approving funding 
and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. TheCPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Uti
lity’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.The CPUC has imposed various conditions that gove
rn the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financialconditions that require PG&E Corpor
ation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary andprudent to meet the Util
ity’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and FinancialResources” in Item 7. MD&A and Ite
m 1A. Risk Factors.)The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California Independent System Opera
torThe FERC has jurisdiction over the Util
ity’s electric transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility’s hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems withother electric system and ge
neration facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesaleelectricity sal
es. The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electric transmission grid,including standards to prote
ct the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. FERC approval is alsorequired under Federal Power Act Se
ction 203 before undertaking certain transactions, including most mergers and consolidations, certain transactions that resultin a change in control of a u
tility, purchases of utility securities and dispositions of utility property. The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million perday for violations of cer
tain federal statutes and regulations.The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion organization for the Utility’s service territory. The CAISO controls the operation of the electrictransmission system in Cali
fornia and provides open access transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis. The CAISO is also responsible for planningtransmission system addit
ions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system ismaintained, and operat
ing an interstate EIM.15

The Nuclear Regulatory CommissionThe NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay. (See “Electricity Resources” below.) NRC regulations require extensive monitoring andreview of the safety, rad
iological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority toimpose fines or to force 
a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both. NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capitalexpenditures at Diablo Canyon, and subst
antial capital expenditures could be required in the future. (For more information about Diablo Canyon, see Item 3. LegalProceedings below.)
Third-party Monitor
On April 12, 2017, the Utility retain
ed a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27,2017 federal crimina
l conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitorfor a period of five yea
rs, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.  The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takesreasonable and appropriate
 steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance, and safety related incentiveprograms on a Utility-wide bas
is. (For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.)
Other Regulators
The CEC is the state’s primary 
energy policy and planning agency. The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.The CEC also is responsible for fore
casts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities’ electricity procurement plans andfor adopting building and appli
ance energy efficiency requirements.The CARB is the state agency responsible 
for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California. (See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and ClimateChange” below.)
In addition, the Utility obt
ains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility’s generation facilities,electricity transmission lines,
 natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities. The Utility also periodically obtains permits,authorizations, and lic
enses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for theoperation of the Utility
’s business and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties thatpermit the Utility to 
install, operate, and maintain the Utility’s electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right to usepublic streets and highways, the Ut
ility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,with no expiration date. (For mo
re information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)Ratemaking Mechanisms
The Utility’s rates for 
electric and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and areturn on invested capit
al (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount thatthe Utility will be aut
horized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set toenable the Utility to r
ecover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, andfinancing expenses). In addi
tion, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers(referred to as “Uti
lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel,to administer public purpos
e and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.16

The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. Similarly, the authorized rate of return on all other Utilityassets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capi
tal proceeding. Other than certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” fromits sales volume through ce
rtain regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are designed to allow the Utility to fully collect itsauthorized base revenue 
requirements. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather oreconomic conditions. The Util
ity’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues andCosts that Impacted Earnings
” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.Due to the seasonal nature of 
the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May - October) because ofhigher demand, driven by air 
conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service generally increase during the winter months (November - March) to accountfor the gas peak due to heat
ing.From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues. For example, theUtility has earned incen
tives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.See “Regulatory Matters” 
in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.Base Revenues
General Rate Cases
The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect fromcustomers to recover th
e Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-ownedelectric genera
tion operations. The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three or four years. The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the firstyear (or “test year
”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRCperiod (known as
 “attrition years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation.Parties in the Utility’s GRC includ
e the PAO and TURN, which generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as numerous intervenorsthat represent other bus
iness, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.On January 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision 
in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to Evaluate Safety and ReliabilityImprovements and Revise the GRC Plan, as a 
result of which the Utility will combine its GRC and GT&S rate cases starting with the 2023 GRC and 2023 GT&Srate case. (For more in
formation about the Utility’s GRC, see “Regulatory Matters 2017 General Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters 2020 General Rate Case” inItem 7. MD&A.)
Natural Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Cases
The CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  TheCPUC generally conducts a GT&S rate case 
every three or four years.  Similar to the GRC, the CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year(or “test year”) of the G
T&S rate case period and typically determines annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate case period. Parties in the Utility’s GT&S r
ate case include the PAO and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as otherintervenors who represent oth
er business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.As previously mentioned, on January 16, 2020, th
e CPUC approved a final decision that requires the Utility to combine its GRC and GT&S rate cases starting withthe 2023 GRC and 2023 GT&S rate case. (For more info
rmation, see “Regulatory Matters - 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “RegulatoryMatters - 2019 Gas Transmission and Sto
rage Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)  17

Cost of Capital ProceedingsThe CPUC periodically conducts a cost of 
capital proceeding to authorize the Utility’s capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. On December 19, 2019, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorizes the Utility’scapital structure 
through 2023, consisting of 52% common equity, 47.5% long-term debt, and 0.5% preferred stock. The CPUC also set the authorized ROEthrough 2023 at 10.25% and reset the 
cost of debt to 5.16%. The CPUC also authorized the continuation of an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s cost ofdebt and ROE to be adjusted if the ut
ility bond index changes by certain thresholds, which are reviewed annually. The CPUC has indicated it will determine in theOII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s Proposed Plan of Reorganization if the Utility needs to submit a cost of capital application after it emergesfrom Chapter 11.
Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The Utility has historically filed a TO rate case every year. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on therequested revenue requi
rement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision. In 2018, the Utility filed a formula rate at FERC, which would beupdated annually according 
to the formula. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility’s retail electric rates and by the CAISO in itsTransmission Access Charges to wholesa
le customers. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.) TheUtility also recovers a po
rtion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts withwholesale transmission custo
mers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are charged individualized ratesbased on the terms of thei
r contracts.Memorandum Account Costs
Periodically, costs aris
e which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests or which are deliberately excluded therefrom. These costsmay result from catastrophic e
vents, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incrementalcosts in a memorandum ac
count and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental andprudently incurred. These a
ccounts allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. While 
the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through a GRC. (Formore information, see 
“Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account,” “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Expense Memorandum Account,” and“Regulatory Matters - Fir
e Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs
Electricity Procurement Costs
California investor-ow
ned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reservemargins, that are not sati
sfied from their own generation facilities and existing electric contracts. The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electricgeneration resources, incl
uding certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resourcesare the least expensiv
e (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their BPPs based onlong-term demand fore
casts. In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s most recent comprehensive BPP. It was revised since its initial approval and willremain in effect 
as revised until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan. On February 8, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s filing that permitted theUtility to temporari
ly manage certain elements of its current BPP as a result of its financial condition, effective as of January 16, 2019.  Additionally, on January25, 2019, the Utility filed with th
e CPUC an update to its BPP to further refine how it manages certain elements of its procurement activity and provide detail of itssales framework.  The updated BPP was eff
ective upon CPUC approval on May 30, 2019.California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BPPs without further after-the-fact reasonablenessreview by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with 
electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approvedplan or if the CPUC determines tha
t the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the cost of replacementpower procured due to unplanned outag
es at utility-owned generation facilities.18

The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily through balancing accounts. (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.) E
ach year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHGemissions costs, and generat
ion fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric rates morefrequently if the forecasted a
ggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electricprocurement and Utility
-owned generation revenues. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resourcerecovery account.
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedprocurement plan, to meet ma
ndatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with resource adequacy requirements. (For more information, see “Electric UtilityOperations - Electric
ity Resources” below as well as Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Natural Gas Procurement, Storage, and Transportation Costs
The Utility recovers the
 cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instruments for it
s core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its core procurement incentive mechanism describedbelow. The Utility reflec
ts the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancingaccounts, with under-colle
ctions and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.The core procurement incenti
ve mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio.Under the core procureme
nt incentive mechanism, the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-basedbenchmark based on a weighted av
erage of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.Costs that fall within a tol
erance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.One-half of the costs above 102% o
f the benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility’s customers receive in their rates 80% of any savingsresulting from the Util
ity’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark. The Utility retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentiverevenues, subject to a cap 
equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs. While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas,consistent with the marke
t-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States)to the points at which the Util
ity’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, andterms of service for 
the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC approves the United Statestariffs that shippers, 
including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, a Canadianregulatory agency. The tr
ansportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurementcosts or as a cost of elec
tricity.19

Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer ProgramsThe CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utilitycustomers.  These programs r
elate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters. Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Ut
ility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under theCalifornia Alternate Ra
tes for Energy (“CARE”) program, which is paid for by the Utility’s other customers.Nuclear Decommissioning Costs
The Utility’s nuclear power 
facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of theproperty for unrestric
ted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to beused for the eventual deco
mmissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’supdated estimated deco
mmissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission theUtility’s nuclear plants.
For costs related to Asset Reti
rement Obligations see “Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements initem 8.
Electric Utility Opera
tionsThe Utility generates electricity
 and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, comme
rcial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) tocustomers in its servic
e territory. Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generationresources, such as rooftop sola
r installations. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)Electricity Resources
The Utility is required
 to maintain capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operatingreserves, deliverabl
e to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of theelectric resourc
es within its portfolio using least-cost dispatch. The following table shows the perc
entage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 2019 represented by each major electric resource, and furtherdiscussed below.

Amount is mainly comprised of net CAISO open market (sales)/purchases.Renewable Energy Resources
California law establish
ed an RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to theircustomers. In October 2015, the Cal
ifornia Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effectiveJanuary 1, 2016, and increases the 
amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, to their customers from33% of their total annua
l retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030compliance period, and in 
each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waivermechanisms, including inc
reased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September2018, the California Governor signed SB 100 into 
law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030;and established state pol
icy that 100 percent of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may incuradditional costs to procur
e renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as“pass-through” costs. The Utili
ty also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. The CPUC is required to open a new rulemakingproceeding to adopt regula
tions to implement the higher renewable targets.Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy. RPS requirements are based on actual procurement, which aligns with the methodology presented in the first column ofthe table above. Actual pro
curement from renewable energy sources was 29.7% in 2019. Per the Power Content Label methodology presented in the table above,27.4% of the Utility’s energy d
eliveries were from renewable energy sources.21

The total 2019 renewable deliveries shown above were comprised of the following:Type
GWh Percent of Bundled RetailSales
Biopower
1,322  3.7 % Geothermal
539  1.5 % Wind
3,412  9.5 % RPS-Eligible Hydroelectric
827  2.3 % Solar
4,574  12.7 % Total
10,674  29.7 % Energy Storage
As required by California law, th
e CPUC established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storage procurement targets to beachieved by each load-se
rving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility. Under the adopted energy storage procurement framework, the Utility isrequired to procure 580 MW of qu
alifying storage capacity by the end of 2021, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.The CPUC also adopted biennial interi
m storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020. Under the adopted framework, the Utility is requiredto submit biennial energ
y storage procurement plans to describe its strategy to meet its interim and total energy storage targets.Through its procurements to da
te, the Utility has largely met its storage targets. The Utility expects to meet its remaining target through existing customerprograms. This outc
ome may change in the future if projects under contract are terminated or if projects fail to be developed.22

 The Utility’s Diablo Canyon power plant consists of two nuclear power reactor units, Units 1 and 2. The NRC operating licenses expire in 2024 and 2025, respectively. On January 11, 2018,the CPUC approved the Utility’s application to retire Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025. (See “Diablo 
Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.)(2) 
The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 105 generating units at 66 powerhouses. All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses notsubject to FERC licensing requirements), with license terms be
tween 30 and 50 years.(3) 
The Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solarstation
 (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW ), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW). All of these facilities are located inFresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.
Generation Resources from Third Parties
The Utility has entered in
to various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance withits CPUC-approved procurement plan. (Se
e “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.) For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.Electricity Transmission
At December 31, 2019, the Utility owned app
roximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500kV. The Utility also operated 33 e
lectric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 65,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system isinterconnected with el
ectric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian provinces ofAlberta and British Columbia, and p
arts of Mexico.Decisions about expansions and main
tenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility’s regulators and the CAISO.23

Electricity DistributionThe Utility’s electr
ic distribution network consists of approximately 107,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2019, approximately25% are underground and approxim
ately 75% are overhead), 68 transmission switching substations, and 760 distribution substations, with a capacity ofapproximately 32,000 MVA. The Utility’s d
istribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations,where equipment reduces th
e high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’scustomers.
These distribution substations s
erve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates electric distributioncontrol center fac
ilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilientgrid.

Natural Gas Utility Operations The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Corecustomers can purchase na
tural gas procurement service (i.e.,  natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement serviceproviders (referred 
to as “core transport agents”).  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gasdelivery, metering and b
illing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combinedservice as “bundled” natu
ral gas service.  Currently, more than 97% of core customers, representing approximately 82% of the annual core market demand, receivebundled natural gas servic
e from the Utility.The Utility generally does no
t provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless thecustomer is a natural g
as-fired generation facility with which the Utility has a power purchase agreement that includes its generation fuel expense. The Utilityoffers backbone gas transm
ission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-corecustomers.  Access to the Util
ity’s backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  TheUtility also delivers gas 
to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.Natural Gas Supplies
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, andthe southwestern United States. The Ut
ility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customersdirectly from produce
rs and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gaspurchase contracts have v
aried generally based on market conditions. During 2019, the Utility purchased approximately 282,000 MMcf of natural gas (net of thesale of excess supply of gas). Substan
tially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s largest individualsupplier represented app
roximately 20% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2019.Natural Gas System Assets
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. AtDecember 31, 2019, the Utility’s n
atural gas system consisted of approximately 43,300 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,300 miles of backbone and localtransmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system andone small station on its lo
cal transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is us
ed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, Ltd. interconne
cting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System. The Foothills system interconnects at the border to thepipeline system owned by Gas Transmiss
ion Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’snatural gas transporta
tion system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,LLC to transport natural gas f
rom the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,Oregon, at the California bord
er. Similarly, the Utility has a firm transportation agreement with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC to transport natural gas fromsupply points in the Southwestern United Sta
tes to interconnection points with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock,Arizona. (For more informa
tion regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.)
25

The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to theUtility’s transmission syst
em.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields forstorage and later withdr
awal.  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility’s northern California transmission system. In 2019,the CPUC approved the discontinuation (th
rough closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - 2019Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
” in Item 7. MD&A.)In 2019, the Utility continued upgr
ading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final NTSBrecommendation from 
its San Bruno investigation to hydrostatically test all high consequence pipeline mileage. The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSBrecommendation by 202
2 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmissionpipelines.

CompetitionCompetition in the Electricit
y IndustryCalifornia law allows
 qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers ratherthan from the utilit
ies up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as “direct access,” or DA.In 2018, the California legis
lature passed a bill to expand the statewide DA cap by 4,000 GWh, and directed the CPUC to consider whether DA should be furtherexpanded, and to present a repo
rt on this matter to the legislature by June 30, 2020. In addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other publicagencies that have qual
ified to become a CCA to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses. By law, a CCA can procure electricityfor all of its residen
ts and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity generated or procured by a utility. On June 3, 2019, the CPUCissued an order implemen
ting the 4,000 GWh increase for DA transactions, including an apportionment to the Utility’s service area of approximately 1,873 GWh.The CPUC is currently conducting a study to in
form its recommendations to the legislature on implementing a further direct transaction reopening schedule andplans to issue a proposed decision on 
these issues on May 22, 2020.The Utility continues to provid
e transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtainmetering and billing se
rvices from their energy service provider. The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing servicesfrom the Utility. In addi
tion to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect chargesintended to recover the g
eneration-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. TheUtility remains the e
lectricity provider of last resort for these customers. SB 520 (codified at Section 387 of the Public Utilities Code), which was signed by thegovernor and became law on Octobe
r 2, 2019, allows for a request to transfer the responsibilities of the provider of last resort obligation from investor-ownedutilities to other entities.
The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar ins
tallations) and the use of customer net energy metering (“NEM”), which allows self-generating customers employing qualifying renewableresources to receive b
ill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing, putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New NEM customers are required to payan interconnection fe
e, utilize time of use rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energyefficiency, and other p
rograms that other customers pay. Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customersas they may seek altern
ative energy providers or adopt self-generation technologies. The CPUC has indicated that it intends to commence a new proceeding torevisit its rules re
lated to NEM customers in 2020.Further, in some circumst
ances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute toprovide retail ele
ctric service, may seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, through eminent domain (although eminent domain is stayed while the Utilityis in Chapter 11, unless the Bankruptcy Judg
e lifts the stay). In 2019, three entities communicated an interest in acquiring certain Utility assets through a voluntarysale during the bankruptcy. I
t is also possible that some of the governmental entities interested in acquiring the Utility’s assets will construct duplicate distributionfacilities to serv
e existing or potential new Utility customers.The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its serviceterritory through a comp
etitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.The effect of such types of 
retail competition generally is to reduce the number of utility customers, leading to a reduction in the amount of electricity purchasedfrom the Utility.
(For risks in connection with inc
reasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
The Utility competes with oth
er natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis oftransportation rates, 
access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes forstorage services with othe
r third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.27

Environmental RegulationThe Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety andhealth of the Utility’s p
ersonnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous andradioactive substances
; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO2  and other GHG emissions; the transportation,handling, storage and disposal of sp
ent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penaltiesfor violation of these l
aws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirementsalso may require the Uti
lity, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Generally, the Utility recovers most of thecosts of complying with environm
ental laws and regulations in the Utility’s rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that conta
in hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation
The Utility’s facili
ties are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act and the Comprehensive Env
ironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulationsadopted by other federal 
agencies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulationsadopted by the State of Califo
rnia and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substanceon the (1) owner or operator of 
the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and(3) in some cases, their 
corporate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as“potentially responsibl
e parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harmcaused to natural resour
ces, and paying for the costs of health studies.The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the Utilitymay be responsible for re
mediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the California DTSC, several Cali
fornia regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurredsignificant environmen
tal remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gascompressor stations are 
located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’sHinkley and Topock natural gas comp
ressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is responsiblefor remediating this g
roundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.For more information about 
environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Air Quality and Climate Change
The Utility’s electr
ic generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,including the federal Cl
ean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to theformation of ground-leve
l ozone, CO2 , sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx ), particulate matter, and other emissions.Federal Regulation
At the federal level, 
the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts toaddress climate chang
e through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.The federal administ
ration of President Donald Trump has generated significant uncertainty with regard to what further actions may occur regarding climatechange at the federa
l level. In the absence of policy at the federal level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance its leadership onclimate change nat
ionally and globally.28

State RegulationCalifornia’s AB 32, the Global War
ming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. TheCARB has approved various regulations to ach
ieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade programthat sets gradually dec
lining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of theeconomy.
The cap-and-trade progr
am’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electric generation and large industrial sectors. In thesubsequent compliance per
iod, which began on January 1, 2015, the scope of the regulation was expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors,effectively cover
ing all of the state economy’s major sectors through 2020. The Utility’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHGemissions attributable to t
he combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than large natural gas delivery customers that are separatelyregulated as covered en
tities and have their own compliance obligation. In 2017, AB 398 extended the program through January 1, 2031. During each year of theprogram, the CARB issues emission allowanc
es (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year. Entities with acompliance obligation 
can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges. Complying entities may also satisfy a portionof their compliance ob
ligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestockowners, and farmers) that o
ccur outside of the entities’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects.SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensure a 40% reduc
tion in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-and-tradeprogram through 2030. The Utility exp
ects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers. TheCalifornia RPS program that requ
ires the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduceGHG emissions in California. In Septemb
er 2018, SB 100 was signed into law, which accelerated the state’s 50% RPS target to December 31, 2026, increased theRPS target to 60% by December 31, 2030, and fur
ther amended the RPS statute to set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by Decembe
r 31, 2045.Climate Change Resilience Strateg
iesDuring 2019, the Utility continued i
ts programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to planfor the actions that i
t will need to take to increase its resilience in light of the impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations. The Utility regularly reviewsthe most relevant scientific literature
 on climate change such as rising sea levels, major storm events, increasing temperatures and heatwaves, wildfires, droughtand land subsidence
, to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies. The Utility maintainsemergency response plans and p
rocedures to address a range of near-term risks, including wildfires, extreme storms, and heat waves and uses its risk-assessmentprocess to prioritize infrastr
ucture investments for longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders from business,government, academia, 
and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future.The Utility is working to bette
r understand the current and future impacts of climate change. In 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal with the CPUC,which examined Utility saf
ety risks. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indicated potential additional Utility safety consequences due to climate change,including in the near te
rm. The Utility is conducting foundational work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and climate-changerelated events. This work is guid
ing efforts to design a Utility-wide climate change risk integration strategy. This strategy will inform resource planning andinvestment, operationa
l decisions, and potential additional programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’sassets, infrastructur
e, operations, employees, and customers.With respect to electric operation
s, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demanddue to more extreme, pe
rsistent, and frequent hot weather. The Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demandresponse programs, infrast
ructure improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage are effective strategies for adapting to the expected changesin demand for electr
icity. The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather andrelated emergenc
ies. Over the long term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due toprojected sea level 
rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges. As the state continues to face increased risk of wildfires, the Utility’s activities,including vegetation mana
gement, will continue to play an important role to help reduce the risk of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.29

Climate scientists predict that climate change will result in varying temperatures and levels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory. This could, in turn,affect the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation. To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adoptingstrategies such as maintaini
ng higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research andnew modeling tools.
With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane intothe atmosphere. The Utili
ty has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reducethe pressure and volume of na
tural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions byimplementing improvements in
 leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipelinematerials.
Emissions Data
PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-profit organi
zation. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2018, which is the most recentdata available, tot
aled about 47 million metric tonnes of CO2  equivalent, more than three-quarters of which came from customer natural gas use. The followingtable shows the 2018 GHG emissions data the Uti
lity reported to the CARB under AB 32, which is the most recent data available. PG&E Corporation and theUtility also publish addition
al GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.Source

 Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator. Therefore, there issome unavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s esti
mated emissions rate.Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation

Water QualityIn 2014, the E
PA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electricpower plants, suc
h as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.Various industry and environment
al groups challenged the federal regulations and they were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.California’s once-through 
cooling policy adopted by the California Water Board in 2010 is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations andtherefore governs implementatio
n in California.The California Water Boar
d’s policy generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life fromexisting power generati
on facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for an alternative compliance approach for nuclear plants if certaincriteria were me
t. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologiesto achieve complianc
e at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the California Water Board in September 2014. The reportaddressed feasibility, 
costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as cooling towers.On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units at the expiration of theircurrent operating li
censes in 2024 and 2025. The CPUC approved the retirement in January 2018. As a result of the planned retirement, the California Water Boardwill no longer need to address a
lternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, the Utility will continue to pay an annual interimmitigation fee unti
l operations cease in 2025.Additionally, the Utility exp
ects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Central CoastRegional Water Quality Contro
l Board and the California Attorney General’s Office regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through coolingdischarge. (For more infor
mation, see “Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized toenter into contracts und
er which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, inexchange for fees paid by th
e utilities’ customers. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from theUtility’s two nuclear gene
rating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry caskstorage faciliti
es to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spentfuel. The Utility and other nu
clear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclearfuel.
In September 2012, the U.S. Department o
f Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submitsannual requests for rei
mbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019, totaled approximately $19million and is current
ly under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates. Considerable uncertainty continues toexist regarding when and whether 
the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accountingpolicies described in M
D&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  Thefollowing discussion of key risk fa
ctors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunctionwith MD&A and the Consolidated Financial St
atements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2019 Form 10-K.  Any of these factors, in whole or in pa
rt, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.
31

Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and LiquidityPG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary pet
itions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with theirbankruptcy cases.
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of theChapter 11 Cases, the financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks,including but not limited 
to the following:•
the ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11Cases that satisfies al
l applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;•
the ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect ofany alternative proposa
ls, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make itdifficult to develop and 
consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;•
the risk that the Noteholder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated;•
the risk that the Backstop Commitment Letters or Debt Commitment Letters could be terminated or that the conditions precedent to funding thereunderare not satisfied or waiv
ed;•
the risk that, if the CPUC fails to approve any settlements between PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the CPUC, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s exit financ
ing may be terminated, making it more difficult for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from Chapter 11 in a timely manner;•
the ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to certain pending and future motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes ofBankruptcy Court rulings and of the Chapt
er 11 Cases in general;•
risks associated with third-party motions or adversary proceedings in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with business operations, includingadditional collateral requirements,
 or the ability to formulate and implement a plan of reorganization;•
increased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;•
the ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for ongoing operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter or to fund aplan of reorganization 
and meet future obligations, including the initial and annual contributions to the Wildfire Fund and commitments outlined in theUtility’s 2020 GRC, 2020-2022 WMP, and other regulato
ry proceedings;•
the potential for a material decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in transactions, including commodity-related transactions,with PG&E Corporation or the Utility and 
a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions;•
the potential for a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom the Utility hascommercial rel
ationships or adverse developments in the commercial and financial terms on which such providers engage in such relationships withPG&E Corporation and the Utility;
•
risks associated with the potential liability arising from the 2019 Kincade fire and any other future post-petition wildfires or catastrophic events during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases;
•
risks associated with claims filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, including claims that have not yet been asserted, that do not specify an amount or in which theasserted amount exceeds 
the actual value of the claim, which present the potential for delays in the Chapter 11 Cases and which may make it difficult toassess the actual amount o
f the liability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility;•
risks associated with the potential that the Utility will not be able to comply with the capital structure requirements authorized by the CPUC, to the extentapplicable, during the pend
ency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter;32

•potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating key employees and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases and th
ereafter, including as a result of the challenging political and operating environment facing the company;•
the significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather thanfocusing exclusively on business ope
rations; and•
the ability to continue as a going concern.PG&E Corporation and the Utility cur
rently are and will continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors andother third parties who have 
claims or interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s plans. These risks anduncertainties could m
aterially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways thatcannot be predicted and m
ay significantly increase the time PG&E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertaintiesassociated with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, it is not possible to predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact thatevents occurring during the Chap
ter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s corporate and capital structure.PG&E Corporation and the Utility cur
rently are and will continue to be required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connectionwith the Chapter 11 Cases, and cert
ain parties may object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns.Such approvals may be denied, condi
tioned or delayed.Operating under Chapter 11 may continue to restrict the abil
ity of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.Under Chapter 11, transactions outs
ide the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market orindustry conditions. These lim
itations include, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to:•
make capital investments outside the normal course of business;•
consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of assets outside the normal course of business;•
grant liens; and•
finance operations, investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities, including the ability to achieve California’s renewable energygoals.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may continue to experienc
e increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.As a result of the filing of 
the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have experienced and may continue to experience increased levels of employeeattrition, and their 
employees will continue to face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale couldmaterially aff
ect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sability to engage, motiv
ate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&E Corporationor the Utility, as applic
able, through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs underthe Bankruptcy Code. The loss of membe
rs of senior management could impair PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to execute their strategies andimplement operation
al initiatives, which would likely have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
33

As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financialperformance.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.Under fresh-start accoun
ting rules that may apply to PG&E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets andliabilities would be adjus
ted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and resultsof operations following eme
rgence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historicalfinancial statem
ents. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring andrelated charges may b
e identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to consummate a 
consensual plan of reorganization, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash f
lows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring.PG&E Corporation and the Utility com
menced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan ofreorganization with any of 
its creditors or other key constituents. On October 17, 2019, the TCC and the Ad Hoc Noteholder Committee filed their competing AdHoc Noteholder Plan. In connection with 
the Noteholder RSA (as defined below), the competing Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan was withdrawn on February 5, 2020. Ifthe Noteholder RSA were to be termin
ated, or if a new competing plan of reorganization were filed by any constituents, the resulting competing plan process couldreduce the likelihood th
at the plan of reorganization that is ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court is the Proposed Plan and, in any event, could have amaterial effe
ct on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&E Corporation and theUtility to reach thei
r stated goals. Additionally, any RSAs entered into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases are likely to be highly conditional on circumstancesoutside the control of PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility.Accordingly, no assurance can be p
rovided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether the Proposed Plan can besuccessfully consummated, how th
e terms of the Proposed Plan may change, whether the Proposed Plan will be the plan of reorganization that is ultimatelyconsummated, how the proposed post-e
mergence capital structure may change, and what the effect of the Proposed Plan or any other plan of reorganization that isconfirmed would have on PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility or on any of their respective equity, debt and other stakeholders, including as to matters of taxationand recovery or distribut
ions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization.Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are successful in obtaining confirmation of the Proposed Plan, the process has been, and will continue to be lengthy,costly and disruptive. A contest
ed plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a more pronounced material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan of reorganization. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able toobtain requisite stakeho
lder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan of reorganization.The uncertainty surrounding th
e prolonged restructuring may also have other material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to:•
the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to raise additional capital;•
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity;•
how PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is viewed by regulators, investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies;•
the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make capital expenditures, including to invest in initiatives necessary to ensure the continued safeoperation of the business;
•
whether the Utility can qualify for the benefits under AB 1054, including obtaining the required state approvals by the statutory deadline;•
whether PG&E Corporation is required to transfer control or ownership of the Utility or its business to a third party, such as the State of California or athird party monitor or r
eceiver that is not accountable to PG&E Corporation’s board of directors or shareholders;34

•PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s enterprise value; and•
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as a going concern.PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to c
laims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility’s financial condit
ion, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Bankruptcy Code provides that the 
confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing underChapter 11. With few exceptions, 
all claims that arose prior to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/ortreatment under the p
lan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. PG&ECorporation and the
 Utility face several significant potential liabilities that arose after the start of the Chapter 11 Cases, including potential liabilities associatedwith the 2019 Kincade fire and th
e PSPS Program. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganizedentities and may have a 
material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and 
may cast substantial doubt on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as a going concern.The DIP Facilities may be insuffici
ent to fund PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
liquidity, including PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependentupon, among other things: (i) PG&E Corpora
tion’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cashcollateral order 
entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP CreditAgreement, (ii) PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to generate cashflow from operations, (iv) PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternativerestructuring transa
ction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and theUtility will be subject to v
arious risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund anyplan of reorganization 
and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and thereorganization.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. On March 27, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved the DIP Facilities (as definedbelow) on a final basis, author
izing the Utility to borrow up to the full amount of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the full amount of the $1.5 billion letter ofcredit subfacility
), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility (as defined below), in each case subject to the terms andconditions of the DIP Credit Agreem
ent. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that the DIP Credit Agreement,together with cash on hand and cash 
flow from operations, will be the Utility’s primary source of capital to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs andthat they will have lim
ited, if any, access to additional financing. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 5 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.The DIP Credit Agreement will ma
ture on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms andconditions are satisfi
ed, including the payment of an extension fee.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
faced and will continue to face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases, and hav
e limited, if any, access to additional financing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cashon hand, cash flow from operations, d
istributions received from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient tocontinue to fund operations dur
ing the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the DIP Credit Agreement is expected to be sufficient to address liquidityneeds for the expected dur
ation of the Chapter 11 Cases, if the Chapter 11 Cases last longer than expected (particularly if the Proposed Plan is not confirmed byJune 30, 2020) there can be no assuran
ce that the DIP Credit Agreement will provide adequate liquidity for such scenario. The ability of PG&E Corporation andthe Utility to mainta
in adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factorsbeyond their control. In the 
event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP CreditAgreement are not suffi
cient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide noassurance that additional fi
nancing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms.35

The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conducttheir business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity may be unable to comply with thecovenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-complianc
e could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not curedor waived, could have a material eff
ect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a nu
mber of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiringPG&E Corporation and the Utility to prov
ide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. TheDIP Credit Agreement also conta
ins general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessarygovernmental authorit
ies, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement includerestrictions on PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loansor advances, engage in merg
ers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in e
ach case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility’s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction ofcertain customary cond
itions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
As a result of these covenants 
and restrictions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changingbusiness, market, and economi
c conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to pursue new business opportunities andstrategies.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtaina waiver in the event PG&E Corporat
ion or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIPCredit Agreement that, i
f not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
The Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Comm
itment Letters provide a number of conditions precedent to the obligations of the Backstop Parties andthe Commitment Parties to fund the Proposed Plan as wel
l as a number of termination rights for the Backstop Parties and the Commitment Parties. There canbe no assurance that the conditions precedent will be sat
isfied or waived, or that events or circumstances will not occur that give rise to the termination rights.If the conditions precedent to funding cannot be satisf
ied or waived, or if the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters are terminated, itcould have a material effec
t on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Backstop Commitment Lett
ers impose a number of conditions that must be satisfied before the Backstop Parties are obligated to fund the Proposed Plan. Inaddition, the Backstop Parties h
ave certain termination rights under the Backstop Commitment Letters, which may be triggered by events beyond the control ofPG&E Corporation and the Utility. The Debt Com
mitment Letters are also subject to numerous conditions precedent and termination rights, including certainconditions precedent and t
ermination rights similar to those included in the Backstop Commitment Letters, as well as certain other conditions precedent, includingthat the Utility shall h
ave received investment grade senior secured debt ratings. For more information on the Backstop Commitment Letters and the DebtCommitment Letters, in
cluding a summary of conditions precedent and termination rights, see “Plan of Reorganization, RSAs, Equity Backstop Commitments andDebt Commitment Letters
” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
fail to complete a monetization transaction utilizing any net operating losses or tax deductions resulting from the payment ofpre-petition wildfir
e-related claims as contemplated in the Backstop Commitment Letters, PG&E Corporation and the Utility must form a trust which wouldprovide for periodic dist
ributions of cash to the Backstop Parties in amounts equal to (i) all tax benefits arising from the payment of wildfire-related claims inexcess of (ii) the fi
rst $1.35 billion of tax benefits, starting with fiscal year 2020, and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected.There can be no assurance th
at the conditions precedent set forth in the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters will be satisfied or waived,or that events or circu
mstances will not occur that give rise to termination rights of the Backstop Parties or the Commitment Parties, which may be beyond thecontrol of PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity.36

If the conditions precedent to funding under the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters cannot be satisfied or waived, or if the BackstopCommitment Letters or Deb
t Commitment Letters are terminated, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to finance the Proposed Plan could be jeopardized,which could materially 
affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Additionally, there can beno assurance that PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility would be able to obtain alternative financing to the transactions contemplated by the Backstop CommitmentLetters and the Debt Commit
ment Letters.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statem
ents have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continueas going concerns. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary chal
lenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred during thepast several years.  Uncertainty regarding thes
e matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s abilities to continue as goingconcerns. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outco
me of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not included anyfinancial statement adjustments that 
might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utilitywill continue as going concerns. PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility suffered material losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018Camp fire, which contributed 
to the decision to file for Chapter 11 protection. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt aboutPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to continue as going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatoryparagraph in their audi
tors’ report which states certain conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continueas going concerns in relat
ion to the foregoing. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For further discussion ofsuch uncertainty, see the 
risk factors above in “Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity” in this Item 1A. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’splans in regard to these m
atters are described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements donot include any adjustments 
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. See “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8.Trading in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s securities during the pendenc

if any, by holders of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases could differ substantially from any value that maybe implied by the trading p
rices of such securities at any particular time during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.Risks Related to Wildfires
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resultingfrom the impact of th
e 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding thecommencement of the Chap
ter 11 Cases. As disclosed below in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and theUtility are subject to nu
merous lawsuits in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires by variousplaintiffs, including wild
fire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. These lawsuits generally assert thatthe Utility’s alleged 
failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines werethe causes of the 2018 Camp fir
e and 2017 Northern California wildfires.37

Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing newlawsuits against PG&E Corporation or th
e Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to suchclaims are expect
ed to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Subrogation RSA, TCC RSA or PSAs were to be terminated and litigation relating tothe 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires and other pre-petition wildfires were to recommence, and the Utility’s facilities, such as its electricdistribution and transmiss
ion lines, were determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utilitycould be liable for prope
rty damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, couldbe substantial and have a m
aterial adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop andconsummate a successful p
lan of reorganization. (See “The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or theUtility are subject, coul
d significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows” below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’fees, the Utility could be 
liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages underother theories of liab
ility, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a materialadverse effect on PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan ofreorganization.
Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility hav
e entered into settlement agreements to resolve the claims of the major classes of claimholders, including Utilitydebtholders, individual wildf
ire victims, holders of subrogated insurance claims and certain public entities, non-consenting claimholders may still be able tochallenge and otherwise i
mpede the Proposed Plan. These settlement agreements could be terminated under various circumstances, some of which are beyond thePG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
control. As described below in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation andthe Utility have entered i
nto agreements with major claimholders or their representatives to settle all pre-petition liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res (and in certain cases, other pre-petition fires) for an aggregate amount of $25.5 billion. These agreements are subject to numerousconditions and terminat
ion rights in favor of third parties, including, among others, (i) certain breaches by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) if PG&ECorporation or the Utility be
come insolvent, (iii) if the Proposed Plan is inconsistent with the terms of these agreements, (iv) if certain milestones are not met and(v) failure of the Proposed Pl
an or the treatment of claims contemplated thereby to be consistent with AB 1054. Certain of these agreements contain additionaltermination rights th
at are beyond the control of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. For example, the PSA with Supporting Public Entities may be terminated by theSupporting Public Entities if FEMA or the OES fa
il to agree that no reimbursement is required from the Supporting Public Entities on account of assistancerendered by either agen
cy in connection with the wildfires noted above. If one or more of these settlement agreements is terminated, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s aggregate l
iability related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires (and in certain cases, other pre-petition fires) could substantiallyexceed $25.5 billion. In addit
ion, if these agreements were terminated, regardless of the ultimate determination of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability,such termination would be expe
cted to result in additional delay and expense in the Chapter 11 Cases.In addition, the TCC RSA is an agreement a
mong PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the TCC, the Shareholder Proponents, and the Consenting Fire ClaimantProfessionals. No government enti
ty (including FEMA and OES/Cal Fire) is party to the TCC RSA. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such governmententities will support the Propos
ed Plan or the treatment of their Fire Victim Claims in the Chapter 11 Cases as provided in the Proposed Plan. If FEMA, OES/CalFire, or other government en
tities that are not Supporting Public Entities do not support the Proposed Plan or treatment of their Fire Victim Claims, such claimscould be material to PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. On February 12, 2020, a number ofindividuals and businesses who hold wildfi
re-related claims in connection with the 2015 Butte fire, 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire, as wellas certain of the Tubbs Pref
erence Plaintiffs, joined in the TCC’s objection to the OES and FEMA claims. Also on February 12, 2020, OES and FEMA filedoppositions to the TCC’s objection.
Absent the settlement ag
reements noted above, potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors,including, but not limited 
to, the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), thenumber, size and type of stru
ctures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of treesdamaged or destroyed, atto
rneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claimsarise, the amount of fi
re suppression and clean-up costs and other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent. Notwithstanding the Bar Date andthe settlement agr
eements entered into as of the date of this filing, there remain a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount ofany potential liabil
ity, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the treatment of suchclaims in the Chapter 11 Cases.

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages, and such damages were allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, or if PG&ECorporation and the Utility wer
e subject to fines or penalties that may be imposed by government entities on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the amount ofsuch punitive damages
, fines, penalties or restitution orders that may result from any criminal charges brought could be significant and could materially affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s abilityto develop and consummate a su
ccessful plan of reorganization. In connection with the Wildfires OII, the Utility has agreed to remedies that will result insubstantial capital 
expenditures that will not be subject to cost recovery. The Utility has received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents.For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision 
that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with natural gas explosion thatoccurred in the City of San Bruno on Septe
mber 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno explosion”). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for theSan Bruno explosion of approximately $558 
million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. Theamount of punitive damages, 
fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation or the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlyingliabilities with resp
ect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.In addition, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity could be the subject of additional lawsuits on account of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter11 Cases and of additional invest
igations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildf
ire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019Kincade fire and future pos
t-petition wildfires during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.As described below in Note 14 to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements under the heading “2019 Kincade fire,” while the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire remainsunder Cal Fire’s investigat
ion and there are a number of unknown facts surrounding the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire, the Utility could be subject to significantliability in excess of 
insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received and are responding to data requests from the CPUC’s SED relating to theKincade fire. PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019Kincade fire.
Additionally, regardless of whe
ther the Utility is ultimately determined to have caused the 2019 Kincade fire or any future post-petition wildfire during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporat
ion’s and the Utility’s bankruptcy timing and process and the ability of the Utility to participate in the WildfireFund could be materially a
ffected as a result of claims arising out of the 2019 Kincade fire. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to consummate theProposed Plan by June 30, 2020 (or at all) cou
ld be impaired, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to amend the Proposed Plan, or developanother alternativ
e to the Proposed Plan, that could be confirmed by June 30, 2020 or at all. The Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letterscontain certain condi
tions precedent and termination rights that could be implicated by the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility may not be able to satisfy, or obtain a waiver of, such conditions precedent to thecommitments, or the Backs
top Parties or the Commitment Parties, respectively, may have the right to terminate such commitments, which would jeopardize PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to finance the Proposed Plan. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain alternative financing to thetransactions contempl
ated by the Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters, and may not be able to obtain financing for an alternative planthat may be proposed by PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility after the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire is better known.Finally, the 2019 Kincade fire o
r a future post-petition wildfire could have adverse consequences on the Utility’s probation proceeding, the Utility’s proceedingswith the CPUC and FERC (including the Safety Culture OII and 
the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII), the criminal investigation into the 2018 Camp fire and futureregulatory proceedings, in
cluding future applications for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additionalreputational harm and 
face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res, see “2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires” in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.

The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed theamount of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurance coverage for wi
ldfire events. The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019Kincade fire could also exceed the amount of PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s insurance coverage for wildfires. Securing liability insurance in futureyears is expected to be increas
ingly difficult and expensive, if available at all.The amount of potential loss
es resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
insurance coverage for wildfire events. The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019 Kincade firecould also exceed the amoun
t of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurance coverage for wildfire events. Even if the Utility satisfies the eligibility and otherrequirements to part
icipate in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, the recovery of any such excess losses from the Wildfire Fund would be capped at 40%.PG&E Corporation and the Utility had l
iability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period fromAugust 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 mil
lion for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence),and $700 million for property d
amages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through thereinsurance market whe
re a catastrophe bond was utilized. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in anamount of $430 million (subje
ct to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence) for the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020, and $1billion in liability 
insurance coverage for non-wildfire events (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), comprised of $520 millionfor the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020 and $480 
million for the period of September 3, 2019 through September 2, 2020. In addition, coveragelimits within these wil
dfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed to be a separate occurrenceunder the terms of the insu
rance policies.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
cost of obtaining the wildfire and non-wildfire insurance coverage in place for the period of August 1, 2019 throughSeptember 2, 2020 is approximat
ely $212 million, compared to the approximately $50 million that the Utility recovered in rates during the year ended December31, 2019. If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows could be materially affected. In addition, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection withthe 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance, and the Utility could also be subject to significant liabilityin excess of insurance in conn
ection with the 2019 Kincade fire. For a discussion of the potential magnitude of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability, see“PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resultingfrom the impact of th
e 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding thecommencement of the Chap
ter 11 Cases” and “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially aff
ected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.” above.PG&E Corporation and the Utility also 
expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availability and to face significantlyincreased insurance costs.
If the Utility is unable to recov
er all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking m
echanisms and in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash f
lows could be materially affected.As of December 31, 2019, the Utility in
curred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Buttefire in excess of costs cu
rrently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA account. The Utility could similarlyincur substantial costs in 
excess of insurance coverage in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire.There can be no assurance th
at the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance, including costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if acourt decision were to
 determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation.40

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, required the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so thatthey do not exceed the maxi
mum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safeservice. SB 901 also authorized th
e CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as“securitization”
), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excessof the CHT. SB 901 does not authorize securit
ization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.After a CPUC July 8, 2019 decision determined 
that a utility that has filed for relief under Chapter 11 cannot access the CHT, on August 7, 2019, the Utilitysubmitted to the CPUC an application 
for rehearing of that decision, the outcome of which is uncertain. For more information on the OIR, see “OIR to ImplementPublic Utilities Code Section 451.2 Rega
rding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901” in Item 7. MD&A.The inability to recove
r all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of furthernon-compliance with the terms of probation or in the e
vent of further modifications to the conditions of probation.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminaltrial against the Uti
lity in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, amongother things, a five-yea
r corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years. Th
e probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of theprobation, the Utility has r
etained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takesreasonable and appropriate
 steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentiveprograms on a Utility-wide bas
is.In 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing 
the Utility’s probation issued various orders related to the Utility’s probation, including a finding that the Utility hadviolated a condition of i
ts probation with respect to reporting requirements, and imposing new conditions of probation. For more information about the Utility’sprobation and the court’s ord
ers, see “U.S. District Court Matters and Probation” in Item 3. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as aresult of the commenc
ement of the Chapter 11 Cases.The Utility could incur ma
terial costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection withthe monitorship (including bu
t not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, notrecoverable through ra
tes, in the event of further modifications to the conditions of its probation, such as those proposed by the court overseeing the Utility’sprobation on January 16, 2020, relat
ing to the hiring of additional contractors to ensure full compliance with certain vegetation management conditions.The outcome of probation could h
arm the Utility’s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies andmake it more difficult to recruit 
qualified personnel and senior management. Further, it could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatoryproceedings and result in in
creased regulatory or legislative scrutiny, including with respect to various aspects of how the Utility’s business is conducted ororganized. (See “Enforce
ment and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)41

The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand thepotential liabilities 
from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.
California law includes a do
ctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liabilityfor attorneys’ fees) 
for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines. Courtshave imposed liability und
er the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne bythe person whose property was damaged 
through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and basedon the assumption that util
ities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation inlawsuits related to the 2018 Ca
mp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and courts have ruled that the doctrine can apply to PG&ECorporation and the Utility in 
those matters. While the Utility currently continues to litigate this issue, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successfulin overturning the rulings th
at inverse condemnation applies in the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire or otherlitigation against PG&E Corpora
tion or the Utility.Furthermore, a court could d
etermine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, orbefore a potential cos
t recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation is premised on theassumption that utilit
ies have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no assurance that the CPUC would authorize costrecovery whether or not a pr
evious court decision had imposed liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (In December 2017, the CPUCdenied recovery of costs th
at San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inversecondemnation principles o
f strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard. That determination was challenged by San Diego Gas &Electric as well as by th
e Utility and Southern California Edison. In October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, effectively ending thechallenge.)
If PG&E Corporation or the Utility we
re to be found liable for damages under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but the Utility was unable to secure a costrecovery decision from 
the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019Kincade fire, and, if the TCC RSA, Subrogation RSA, or PSAs were to be ter
minated, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015Butte fire. (See “PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potentiallosses resulting from the 
impact of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire),notwithstanding the commenc
ement of the Chapter 11 Cases,” and “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows could be materi
ally affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases”above.)
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of the Utility’s implementation of its PSPS program.As outlined in the 2019 Wildfir
e Mitigation Plan, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have adopted the PSPS program to proactively de-energize lines that traverseareas under elevated 
and extreme risks for wildfire when forecasts predict extreme fire-threat conditions. In addition to the 2019 PSPS events, the Utility expectsthat PSPS events will be necessary in 2020 and 
future years. Approximately 5.4 million electric customer premises may potentially be impacted by PSPS events.42

Since June 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have carried out several PSPS events. These PSPS events have been subject to significant scrutiny andcriticism by various st
akeholders, including the California Governor, the CPUC and the court overseeing the Utility’s probation. On November 12, 2019, theCPUC issued an order to show cause why the Utility should not b
e sanctioned for alleged violations of law related to its communications with customers,coordination with local gove
rnments, and communications with critical facilities and public safety partners during the PSPS events in late 2019. On November 13,2019, the CPUC instituted an OII to examine 2019 PSPS events c
arried out by California’s investor-owned utilities and to consider enforcement actions. TheUtility also is the subjec
t of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events that was filed in the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2019. OnJanuary 24, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a proposed d
ecision in the 2020 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) Forecast proceeding that, if finalized,would require the Utility to 
include in its application for the 2019 ERRA Compliance Review an accounting of the PSPS events that occurred in its service territoryin 2019 and how the PSPS impacted its revenue co
llections. Also, on January 27, 2020, the California state senate approved SB 378 that, if passed by the assemblyand then enacted into law, would r
equire the CPUC, on or before June 1, 2021, to establish a procedure for customers, local governments, and others affected by ade-energization event to reco
ver specified costs incurred as a result of the de-energization event from an electrical corporation within specified time periods. Thebill would also require the CPUC to estab
lish rules determining whether these payments can be recovered from ratepayers.In addition, the proposal of SB 378, which would impos
e penalties and other requirements on electric utility companies relating to PSPS events, could have amaterial effe
ct on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition to other requirements, SB378 would impose on an electric u
tility company a civil penalty of at least $250,000 per 50,000 affected customers for every hour that a PSPS event is in place,would require the CPUC to establish a proc
edure for customers, local governments and others to recover specified costs incurred during a PSPS event from theelectric utili
ty company, which cost recovery would be borne by shareholders, and would prohibit an electric utility company from billing customers for anynonfixed costs during a PSPS event.
Further, the proposals of AB 1941 could have a 
material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows. AB 1941 proposes to suspend RPS requirements, det
ermine the savings to electric utility companies from the suspension and direct those savingstowards system hardening to mi
tigate wildfire risks and PSPS impacts, and would prohibit salary increases or bonuses to executive officers during the suspensionof RPS requirements.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t predict the timing and outcome of the OII, order to show cause, the class action litigation, and pending litigation. PG&ECorporation and the Utility cou
ld be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation andclaims by customers as a 
result of the Utility’s implementation of its PSPS program, including with respect to the October 9, 2019 PSPS event, which could resultin fines, penalties, custo
mer rebates or other payments. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&E Corporation or the Utilitywere to issue any credits, r
ebates or other payments in connection with any other PSPS events (whether past events or in the future)) or liability for damages couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS programhas had an adverse impact on PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events may increasethese negative perceptions.
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforc
ement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory ProceedingsPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments.The Utility’s financia
l results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC openedan OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt 
criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs. After aCPUC July 8, 2019 decision determined that a u
tility that has filed for relief under Chapter 11 cannot access the CHT, on August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted tothe CPUC an application for rehea
ring of that decision, the outcome of which is uncertain. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related towildfires could have a ma
terial effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. (See “RegulatoryMatters - Other Regulatory Pro
ceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.)In addition, SB 901 requires utili
ties to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  SB 901establishes factors to b
e considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  Failure to substantially comply with theplan could result in fines 
and other penalties imposed on the Utility that could be material.  (See “Regulatory Matters – Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7.MD&A.)

On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed into law AB 1054, which, among other policy reforms, provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that isavailable for eligible electric utility c
ompanies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by theapplicable elect
ric utility company’s equipment. Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility have delivered notice to the CPUC electing to participate in theWildfire Fund and even if th
e Utility were eligible to do so, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties,including the Utility’s ab
ility to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund are just and reasonable, subject to a disallowancecap, and that the Wildf
ire Fund has sufficient remaining funds.The costs of participat
ing in the Wildfire Fund (should the Utility be eligible to do so) are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year life of thefund. The timing and amount of any po
tential charges associated with shareholder contributions would also depend on various factors, including the timing ofresolution of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utilityrecognizes impairm
ent for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfireoccurs in the service territor
y of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating inthe Wildfire Fund ultim
ately outweigh these substantial costs.Finally, AB 1054 revised some of the SB 901 requir
ements regarding wildfire mitigation plans, including creating a Wildfire Safety Division to review future plansand that plans should cover a th
ree-year period.Also, in June 2018, the State of Californ
ia enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring complianceby January 1, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the State of Cal
ifornia announced proposed regulations which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. TheCCPA requires companies that process 
information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharingpractices, allows consume
rs to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides forfinancial penalti
es in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. Failure to comply with the CCPA could result infines imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility that could be material.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ability of PG&ECorporation and the Utility to participate 
in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, which is subject to numerous uncertainties and which could involve significantorganizational or governance changes.
The Utility’s ability to p
articipate in the Wildfire Fund is subject to numerous eligibility and other requirements set forth in AB 1054, including, among others, (a)the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case has b
een resolved pursuant to a plan of reorganization by June 30, 2020, (b) the CPUC has approved the Utility’s plan ofreorganization, includ
ing the Utility’s resulting governance structure as being acceptable in light of the Utility’s safety history, criminal probation, recent financialcondition and other facto
rs deemed relevant by the CPUC, and (c) the CPUC has determined that the Utility’s plan of reorganization is (i) consistent withCalifornia’s clima
te goals and (ii) neutral, on average, to the Utility’s ratepayers. (See “Assembly Bill 1054” in Item 7. MD&A.) There can be no assurance thatPG&E Corporation and the Utility will b
e able to meet these eligibility and other requirements for participating in the Wildfire Fund, including that the CPUC willissue the necessary approva
ls or make the necessary determinations.On October 4, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to consider the r
atemaking and other implications “that will result from the confirmation of a plan of reorganizationand other regulatory approv
als necessary to resolve” the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Chapter 11 Proceedings OII”). The scope of the Chapter 11 Proceedings OIIincludes, among others, any regu
latory approvals required in order for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to become eligible to participate in the Wildfire Fund andany other regulatory approv
als required by AB 1054. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the outcome of the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII.Additionally, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s ability to meet the eligibility and other requirements may be adversely impacted by the California Governor’sreview of the Proposed Plan that PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 31, 2020.Failure to meet the e
ligibility conditions to access relief under the Wildfire Fund, including satisfaction of the eligibility requirements described above and theUtility making its init
ial contribution thereto, would preclude PG&E Corporation and the Utility from accessing the Wildfire Fund for future wildfire-relatedclaims and any relat
ed benefits, including the disallowance cap, and could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows.44

The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility’s financial condit
ion, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC’sinvestigative enforcem
ent proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requestsfor information.
The Utility is subject to ex
tensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcementproceedings in connection with 
compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection withthe Wildfires OII, the 
locate and mark OII, the order to show cause related to the 2019 PSPS events, the safety culture OII, and other matters that the CPUC’s SEDmay be investigating. The SED could l
aunch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automaticstay imposed as a result of 
the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of suchproceedings are stayed.
The SED has discretion whether to issue 
a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it may impose the maximum statutory penalty of$50,000, per penalty, per day, with an ad
ministrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutorypenalty is $100,000, per penalty, pe
r day. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations thatcontinued for more than one d
ay. The SED may also issue multiple citations per violation or address multiple violations in a single citation. While it is uncertainhow the CPUC would calculate the number of vio
lations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s liquidity and results of operations. (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1. Business and Note 15 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacyrequirements; customer billing;
 customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safetyand inspection practic
es; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; andenvironmental compli
ance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safetycitation programs. The a
mount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See “Risks Related to Wildfires,”above.) The Utility is unable 
to predict the outcome of pending investigation, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount ofany costs and expenses associat
ed with such investigations.If these investigations 
result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantialand, in the event of a judgmen
t against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations,or future enforcement actions
, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; forexample, by enabling part
ies to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations. (See also“PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation” above.)45

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility’s ability tomanage its operating expenses and capital expendi
tures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover re
asonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial resultscould be materially 
affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn itsauthorized ROE. The outcome of the Ut
ility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties;potential rate imp
acts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’sregulators, consumer and oth
er stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gasservices. Further, an incr
ease in the amount of capacity located in the Utility’s service territory that is procured by the CAISO under Reliability Must Run(“RMR”) contracts could inc
rease the Utility’s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers.In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably se
rve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing marketcircumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), orcompliance with new state 
laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial delaybetween when the Utility incurs 
the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC maydisallow costs that they det
ermine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.The Utility also is requir
ed to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of astate-wide electric vehicle chargin
g infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energyefficiency programs, 
energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. TheUtility’s ability to r
ecover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on thefinal form of legislative or re
gulatory requirements, and the associated ratemaking mechanisms associated with these initiatives, including the timely adjustment ofsuch mechanisms to reflect a
ny lowered customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas services.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results dep
end upon the Utility’s continuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity andnatural gas procurement costs, from customers in a ti
mely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, theUtility’s ability to r
ecover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust theUtility’s rates to refl
ect such events.The Utility meets customer
 demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.  The Utility must manage these sources using thecommercial and CPUC regulatory p
rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procur
ement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not complywith these principles or i
f the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.Further, the contractual 
prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a varietyof reasons, including developm
ents in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lowercustomer demand due to adve
rse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC’s current approval of thecontracts, the CPUC could disallow contr
act costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUCreasonableness standard.
The Utility’s ability to 
recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continuesto function effectively. 
Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems andsoftware on which the market 
mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.  The CPUC could prohibit the Utilityfrom passing through the higher 
costs of electricity to customers.46

Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs throughmunicipalization of 
the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs that provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumerswho become direct access 
customers of alternative generation providers. (See “Competition in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.) As the number of bundledcustomers (i.e., those custo
mers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as theUtility would have a smalle
r customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable chargesfor above market gener
ation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. Inaddition, the Utility’s ab
ility to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if theformer customers return to recei
ving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timelyrecover through rates or 
that it may not be able to recover at all.In addition, increasing l
evels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to 
receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantlyhigher bills due to an incr
ease in customers seeking alternative energy providers.A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,and distribution investmen
ts. If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of authorized capitalinvestment could declin
e as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due tocustomer migration to o
ther energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation,unless substantially offse
t through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows.Further, changes in commodity p
rices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility general
ly recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise incommodity prices could create
 overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs. To relieve some of this upward 
rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.If the Utility is unable 
to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changingloads, the wide deployment of dis
tributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s financi
al condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology
The Utility’s electri
city and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generatingsystem.  (See “Electri
c Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business above.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROEdepends on its abilit
y to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utilityundertakes substantial ca
pital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated todecommission its elec
tricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.The Utility’s ability to s
afely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond theUtility’s control, includ
ing those that arise from:•
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines or other assets orgroup of assets, that can caus
e explosions, fires, public or workforce safety issues, large scale system disruption or other catastrophic events;47

•an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low;•
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life;•
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
•
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmentaldamage, or reputationa
l damage;•
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;•
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;•
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonablyshould have identified, as unsa
fe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wildfire or natural gas explosion);•
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm orextended outages;
•
operator or other human error;•
a motor vehicle incident involving a Utility vehicle (or one operated on behalf of the Utility) resulting in serious injuries to or fatalities of the workforceor the public, property dam
age, or other consequences;•
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;•
construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that damage the Uti
lity’s underground pipelines;•
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and•
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.The occurrence of any 
of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generatingoutput; damage the Utili
ty’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customersor others; and cause persona
l injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and tocompensate third part
ies.  Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.48

The adverse impact of the occurrence of any of these events may be exacerbated by the difficulty PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience in makingsufficient capita
l expenditure as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility’s ability to finance capital expenditures andpay other ongoing expenses will pri
marily depend on the levels of its operating cash flows and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement. In the event thatPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
capital needs increase materially due to unexpected events or transactions including but not limited to the events describedabove, additional financ
ing outside of the DIP Facilities may be required, and there can be no assurance that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be able toobtain such additional fin
ancing on favorable terms or at all, or that such additional financing will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In the event that PG&ECorporation and the Utility a
re unable to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms or at all, or are unable to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of suchadditional financing, PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility may be unable to make necessary capital expenditures in connection with the occurrence of any of theabove events. For more inform
ation on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s material commitments for capital expenditures, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7.MD&A.
Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetationmanagement, or the constr
uction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can besubject to penalties or o
ther enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability,penalties or other enfo
rcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery underall circumstances o
r against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s insurance coverage may not b
e sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, ormay not be available at a reasonable cos
t, or available at all.The Utility has experienc
ed increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility’s ordinaryoperations.  PG&E Corporation, the Util
ity or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased insurance costs infuture years.  No assurance c
an be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage.  Uninsured losses and increases in the costof insurance may not be re
coverable in customer rates.  A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.As a result of the potentia
l application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded byinsurance companies, the 
risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires, and 
the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all.  Inaddition, the Utility is unab
le to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.If the amount of insuranc
e is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs ofany uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.49

The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which couldmaterially affect 
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The electric power indust
ry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-ownedgeneration and energy stor
age) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energytechnologies that support Cal
ifornia’s climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environment
al policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law onSeptember 10, 2018, increases f
rom 50% to 60%, the percentage of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes afurther goal to have an e
lectric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customersand third parties of DERs, such as on-si
te solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies.  These developmentswill require moderniz
ation of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid’s capacity, andinterconnect DERs.
In order to enable the 
California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiencyprograms, energy storage opt
ions, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects).To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to
: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higherpenetration of DERs and, consider fu
ture grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs,and if feasible, what, if 
any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution gridoperator. The CPUC also authorized deve
lopment of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combatingclimate change. The new prog
rams will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles.In addition, in light of the s
tate’s commitment to clean energy and carbon neutral economy by 2045, California has recently proposed public policies that prohibitor restrict the use and 
consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will have for effect to reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas usecould lead to a reduction 
in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer be “usedand useful,” potentially 
causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded. (Under the CPUC rules, when an asset no longer meets the standard of“used and useful,” the util
ity no longer recovers the costs from its customers or earns the associated rate of return.) However, while natural gas demand is projectedto decline over time, 
the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safe
ty enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover in rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety andreliability could m
aterially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The industry changes, costs associ
ated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’sinability to successful
ly adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
A cyber incident, cyber security br
each, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility’s operational networks and information technology systems couldhave a material effect on i
ts financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s electr
icity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communicationtechnologies, which can be dam
aged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entit
ies, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense,Homeland Security and Energy, and th
e White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, andfrequency.  The Utility’s ope
rational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with newtechnologies and control syst
ems.  Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees,significantly disrupt ope
rations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in themost safe and effici
ent manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.50

The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,including the Utility’s f
inancial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and theirdependents, contractors, and o
ther individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and toprovide other services to 
the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (includingcustomer energy usage a
nd personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid modernization andcustomer choice. These th
ird-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, or experiencesecurity incidents or in
adequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems could impact the Utility’s ability totrack or collect revenues an
d to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.The Utility and its third-p
arty vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to theUtility’s information 
technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.  Noneof these breaches or at
tempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.  Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that theUtility will be able to pr
event unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations.  Suchevents could subject the Uti
lity to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacylaws, investigations, and regul
atory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sreputation, any of which could hav
e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility maintains cyb
er liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents.  However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance willcontinue to be availabl
e at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered byinsurance or recoverab
le in rates.The operation and decommissioning of the Utilit
y’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able tofully recover its costs i
f regulatory requirements change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire.The operation of the 
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such asrisks relating to the sto
rage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity,natural disaster, or t
errorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may berequired under federa
l law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility butat any other nuclear power p
lant in the United States. On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern aboutthe safety of nuclear g
eneration and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging theactions of the NRC and urging government
al entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail,regulatory proceedings m
ay take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changesin legislation, regula
tions, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease beforetheir respective l
icenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecoveredinvestment and such charge 
could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incurcosts in connection with (i) 
an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, which program has been approved by the CPUC,and (ii) an employee r
etraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project andelsewhere in the Utility. Th
ere can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs.51

The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.  (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business above.)  If the Utility we
re unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.  The Utilitymay determine that 
it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRCmay order the Utility to 
cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.  The Utility may incur a material charge if itceases operations at Diab
lo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2019, the Utility’sunrecovered investment 
in Diablo Canyon was $1.6 billion.The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, atthe end of their useful l
ives.  (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - “Asset Retirement Obligations” of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatement in Item 8.)  Th
e CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioningcharges that are col
lected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  If theUtility’s actual deco
mmissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.For certain critical technologies, produc
ts and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers.  In the event thesesuppliers are unable to perform, the Utilit
y could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers.The Utility relies on a l
imited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services.  Although the Utility has long-term agreementswith such suppliers, if the suppli
ers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while itimplements altern
ative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers.  As a result, the Utility’s business, financial condition, and results ofoperations could be mate
rially affected.  As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (acquired in 2018 by Brookfield BusinessPartners L.P.) for its nuclea
r fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter™ devices andsoftware, and of mana
ged services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers.  If these suppliersencounter performanc
e difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems,the Utility’s meter
ing, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.The Utility may be required to incur substantia
l costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility’s business and the Utilitymay be subject to fines and penalties 
for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.The Utility must comply with th
e terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continuedoperation of the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many ofthe Utility’s capital investme
nt projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or othergovernmental permits. Th
ese permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits andlicenses could be revoked or 
modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. Inaddition, the Utility oft
en seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generationfacility.
If a license or permit is n
ot renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairmentcharge or other costs. Befor
e renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.In particular, in conne
ction with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new licenseconditions that could, among oth
er things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.In addition, local governm
ents may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not beenpreviously required to obta
in. The Utility may incur pena
lties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply withnecessary governmental permit
s, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated complianceand other costs in a time
ly manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materiallyaffected.

Risks Related to Environmental FactorsSevere weather conditions, extended drought and shifting cli
mate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Extreme weather, prior exte
nded drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. TheUtility’s service te
rritory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-relatedignition events than other Ca
lifornia IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as prior drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can driveadditional vegetation g
rowth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events.  In California, over the pastfive years, inconsistent 
and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficultto manage.  In particul
ar, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility’s service area as a result of a prior extended period of drought, bark beetleinfestations in the Cali
fornia forest and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmentalfactors. Contributing
 factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices.  The combined effects ofextreme weather and c
limate change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires in California than the annualaverage, including five o
f the most devastating wildfires in California’s history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that showsthat approximately half of t
he Utility’s service territory is facing “elevated” or “extreme” fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility’s nearly81,000 distribution overhead ci
rcuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threatareas, significantly 
more in total than other California IOUs.Severe weather events and oth
er natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, risingsea levels, pandemics, sol
ar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolongedpower outages, property damage, 
injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporationand the Utility.  Any such event could h
ave a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.  Any of such events also could lead 
to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances,particularly if th
e Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’spractices and/or the failure of
 electric and other equipment of the Utility.Further, the Utility has been s
tudying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on theUtility’s operations and is d
eveloping contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project thatclimate change will increase electricity
 demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could changeand the Utility would need to consid
er managing or acquiring additional generation.  If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources toreplace hydroelect
ric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. Inaddition, flooding caused by ris
ing sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets.  TheUtility could incur substant
ial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  TheUtility anticipates 
that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery mayincrease.
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or increased exp
enses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change,PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.53

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financial results.
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and othercosts associated with compl
iance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required topay for environmental r
emediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although theUtility has recorded li
abilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,remediation alternatives, the ap
plicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 15 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.)Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
tal or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanctions.
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover in rates.Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through ratesor insurance. (See “Environm
ental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility’s costs toremediate groundwater 
contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue tohave, a material effect on P
G&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimatedcosts and by the extent to which a
ctual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.State climate policy r
equires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.  Various proposals for addressing these reductions have thepotential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs, which may 
impact the future of natural gas services. The future recovery of the increasedcosts associated with compliance is uncer
tain.The CARB is the state’s primary regu
lator for GHG emission reduction programs.  Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natu
ral gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost willbe reflected in custo
mer bills. CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas.  These include more aggressiveenergy efficiency prog
rams to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, andreplacement of natural gas ap
pliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand.  These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset byCARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to rep
lace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications.  CARB also proposes a displacement ofsome conventional natura
l gas with above-market renewable natural gas.  The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gascustomer bills and a poten
tial mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. In addition, local city governments have passed ordinancesrestricting use of natu
ral gas in new construction, and if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas.54

Other Risk FactorsPoor investment performance or other fac
tors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pensionplan, other postretirement benefits p
lans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.PG&E Corporation and the Utility provid
e defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility alsomaintains three trus
ts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the valueof plan assets and trust asse
ts. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension andother postretirement benefits i
s also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return onplan assets, employee demog
raphics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future governmentregulation, and prior cont
ributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trustassets, changes in the laws or r
egulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions orforecasts related 
to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesof the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension andpostretirement plans o
r if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover thecontributions or additiona
l costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially affected.
The Utility’s success depends on the availab
ility of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreementswhich cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disrupt
ions occur.The Utility’s workforce is ag
ing and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts torecruit and train new f
ield service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’semployees are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renewthe terms of these agr
eements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-representedUtility employees could jo
in one of these unions in the future.PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore thereputational harm gen
erated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences couldmaterially aff
ect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s business activit
ies are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique toCalifornia.
The Utility’s business activ
ities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility’s future performance may be affected by events and economicfactors unique to Californ
ia or by regional regulation or legislation, including, for example, the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See “The doctrine of inversecondemnation, if applied by 
courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities fromsuch litigation and mat
erially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows” above.)ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF

ITEM 2. PROPERTIESThe Utility owns or has obtained the 
right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility’s electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electricgeneration facilities, natural ga
s gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1.Business, under “Electric Uti
lity Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarilythrough various leases, ease
ments, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 11 millionsquare feet of real p
roperty, including 9 million square feet owned by the Utility. The Utility’s corporate headquarters comprises approximately 1.7 million squarefeet located in seve
ral Utility-owned buildings in San Francisco, California.PG&E Corporation also leases approxi
mately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease will expire in 2022. 
The Utility currently owns approx
imately 158,000 acres of land, including approximately 128,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002 the Utility agreed toimplement its LCC to perman
ently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent protections,as well as to make approxim
ately 40,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations. The six “beneficial public values” beingpreserved by the LCC include: natu
ral habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agriculturaluses; and historic values. The Ut
ility’s goal is to implement all the transactions needed to implement the LCC by the end of 2022, subject to securing all requiredregulatory approvals.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In addition to the following pro
ceedings, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course oftheir business.  For more infor
mation regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 2, 14, and 15 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8. U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court imposed a sentence on the Utility in connection with the conviction. The courtsentenced the Utility to 
a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by the Monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years, a fine of 
$3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained the Monitor 
at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the Monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain thesafety of its gas and
 electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis.On November 27, 2018, the court overseeing 
the Utility’s probation issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the NorthernDistrict of California 
(the “USAO”) and the Monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the terms of itsprobation, including what requi
rements of the Utility’s probation “might be implicated were any wildfire started by reckless operation or maintenance of PG&Epower lines” or “might be i
mplicated by any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire by PG&E.” The court also ordered the Utility toprovide “an accurate 
and complete statement of the role, if any, of PG&E in causing and reporting the recent 2018 Camp fire in Butte County and all otherwildfires in California
” since January 2017 (“Question 4 of the November 27 Order”). On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the Office ofthe California Attorney Gene
ral advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines wouldconstitute a crime und
er California law.” The responses of the Attorney General were submitted on December 28, 2018, and the responses of the Utility, the USAOand the Monitor were submitt
ed on December 31, 2018.56

On January 3, 2019, the court issued a new order requiring that the Utility provide further information regarding the 2017 Atlas fire. The court noted that “[t]hisorder postpones the question of th
e adequacy of PG&E’s response” to Question 4 of the November 27 Order. On January 4, 2019, the court issued another orderrequiring that the Util
ity provide, “with respect to each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that [Cal Fire] has attributed to [the Utility’s]facilities,” info
rmation regarding the wind conditions in the vicinity of each fire’s origin and information about the equipment allegedly involved in each fire’signition. The responses of the Uti
lity were submitted on January 10, 2019.On January 9, 2019, the court ordered th
e Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believethere has been a violat
ion of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. In addition, on January 9, 2019,the court issued an order (
the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:•
prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-windconditions, . . . identify and fix 
all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]identify and fix damaged o
r weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its gridsimilar to any condition 
that contributed to any previous wildfires,”•
“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions,” and•
at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the windconditions then prevailing.”
The Utility was ordered to show cause by J
anuary 23, 2019 as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility’sresponse was submitted on January 23, 2019. The 
court requested that Cal Fire file a public statement, and invited the CPUC to comment, by January 25, 2019. OnJanuary 30, 2019, the court found that 
the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.The court issued an order sta
ting that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. Also, on January 30, 2019, the court ordered theUtility to submit to the cou
rt on February 6, 2019 the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that the Utility was required to submit to the CPUC by February 6, 2019 inaccordance with SB 901, and invited in
terested parties to comment on such plan by February 20, 2019. In addition, on February 14, 2019, the court ordered theUtility to provide addition
al information, including on its vegetation clearance requirements. The Utility submitted its response to the court on February 22, 2019.On March 5, 2019, the court issued an orde
r proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:•
“fully comply with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements;”•
“fully comply with the specific targets and metrics set forth in its wildfire mitigation plan, including with respect to enhanced vegetation management;”•
submit to “regular, unannounced inspections” by the Monitor “of PG&E’s vegetation management efforts and equipment inspection, enhancement, andrepair efforts” in 
connection with a requirement that the Monitor “assess PG&E’s wildfire mitigation and wildfire safety work;”•
“maintain traceable, verifiable, accurate, and complete records of its vegetation management efforts” and report to the Monitor monthly on its vegetationmanagement status and prog
ress; and•
“ensure that sufficient resources, financial and personnel, including contractors and employees, are allocated to achieve the foregoing” and to forgoissuing “any dividends until [th
e Utility] is in compliance with all applicable vegetation management requirements as set forth above.”57

The court ordered all parties to show cause by March 22, 2019, as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The responsesof the Utility, the USAO, Cal Fire, the CPUC, and non-party vi
ctims were filed on March 22, 2019. At a hearing on April 2, 2019, the court indicated it wouldimpose the new conditions of proba
tion proposed on March 5, 2019, on the Utility, and on April 3, 2019, the Court issued an order imposing the new terms thoughamended the second condition 
to clarify that “[f]or purposes of this condition, the operative wildfire mitigation plan will be the plan ultimately approved by theCPUC.”
Also, on April 2, 2019, the court direct
ed the parties to submit briefing by April 16, 2019, regarding whether the court can extend the term of probation beyond fiveyears in light of the viol
ation that has been adjudicated and whether the Monitor reports should be made public. The responses of the Utility, the USAO, and theMonitor were filed on April 16, 2019. The Ut
ility’s response contended that the term of probation may not be extended beyond five years and the USAO’sresponse contended that whethe
r the term of probation could be extended beyond five years was an open legal issue.The court held a sentencing h
earing on the probation violation related to reporting requirements in connection with the 2017 Honey fire on May 7, 2019. After thathearing, the court imposed 
two additional conditions of probation by order dated May 14, 2019: (1) requiring that PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors, ChiefExecutive Officer, senio
r executives, the Monitor and U.S. Probation Officer visit the towns of Paradise and San Bruno “to gain a firsthand understanding of theharm inflicted on those 
communities;” and (2) requiring that a committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors assume responsibility for tracking progress ofthe 2019 Wildfire Mitig
ation Plan and the additional terms of probation regarding wildfire safety, reporting in writing to the full Board at least quarterly. The courtalso stated that it was not go
ing to rule at this time on whether the court has authority to extend probation and would leave that question “in abeyance.” The courtdid not discuss whether the Monitor 
reports should be made public. Members of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors and senior management attended sitevisits to the Town of Paradise on June 7, 2019 and 
the City of San Bruno on July 16, 2019, which were coordinated by the U.S. Probation Officer overseeing theUtility’s probation. In addi
tion, the Compliance and Public Policy Committee, a committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors, will be responsible fortracking the Utility’s p
rogress against the Utility’s wildfire mitigation plan, as approved by the CPUC, and compliance with the terms of the Utility’s probationregarding wildfire safety.
On July 10, 2019, the court ordered the Uti
lity to respond to a Wall Street Journal article titled “PG&E Knew for Years Its Lines Could Spark Wildfires, andDidn’t Fix Them” on a paragraph-by
-paragraph basis, stating the extent to which each paragraph in the article is accurate. The court also ordered the Utility todisclose all politic
al contributions made by the Utility since January 1, 2017, and provide additional explanations regarding those contributions and dividendsdistributed prior to fi
ling the Chapter 11 Cases. The Utility filed its response with the court on July 31, 2019. In the response, the Utility disagreed with the WallStreet Journal artic
le’s suggestion that the Utility knew of the specific maintenance conditions that caused the 2018 Camp fire and nonetheless deferred work thatwould have addressed those conditions.
On July 26, 2019, the Monitor submitted a l
etter to the court regarding its VM field inspections, which were designed to evaluate the Utility’s compliance withaspects of its publicly-
filed Wildfire Mitigation Plan’s EVM. The Monitor’s letter, which was filed on the public docket on August 14, 2019, provided itspreliminary observat
ions and preliminary findings, which included that (1) the Utility’s contractors had missed trees that should have been identified and workedunder the EVM program; and (2) th
e Utility’s systems for recording, tracking and assigning EVM work were inconsistent and may have been contributing to themissed work. In its September 3, 2019 r
esponse to the Monitor’s letter, the Utility detailed its plan to address the concerns raised by the Monitor. The Monitor’sconcerns and the Utility’s 
response were discussed at a hearing on September 17, 2019.During the September 17, 2019 hearing, 
the court asked the Utility to provide information about: (1) its preparation for high wind season; and (2) the number offires 10 acres or grea
ter allegedly caused by the Utility to date in 2019. The Utility responded on October 1, 2019 by describing its efforts to strengthen itsprograms and infrastruc
ture to maximize safety and mitigate the potential wildfire risk during high wind season. The Utility also responded that as of September17, 2019, the Utility’s equipment 
may have contributed to nine ignitions in 2019 that resulted in fires 10 acres or greater. Two of these fires were potentially causedby vegetation and one was potenti
ally caused by equipment. On October 2, 2019, the court asked the Utility for further information regarding the three firespotentially caused by vege
tation and equipment. In its response, which was filed on October 9, 2019, the Utility provided information regarding certain fires,including but not limited 
to total acreage of the fire, ignition date, and potential causes.On October 8, 2019, the court held a hea
ring related to the Utility’s San Bruno community service.58

On October 14, 2019, the court issued a request for information in connection with the PSPS event the Utility initiated on October 9, 2019 that shut off power toapproximately 738,000 custome
rs in 34 counties across Northern and Central California, asking the Utility to file a statement setting forth, among otherinformation, “how many tre
es and limbs fell or blew onto the deenergized lines and how many of those would likely have caused arcing had the power been lefton.” The Utility’s response was fi
led on October 30, 2019.On November 4, 2019, the court issued a requ
est for information in connection with PSPS events the Utility initiated in late October of 2019, asking the Utility tofile a statement s
etting forth, among other information, the same type of information requested on October 14, 2019 in connection with the PSPS event initiated onOctober 9, 2019. The Utility filed 
its response on November 29, 2019.On November 12, 2019, the court approved the 
request of the City of San Bruno to allow the Utility to satisfy the remainder of its community service requirementsby making a $3 million paymen
t to the City of San Bruno, and on November 27, 2019, the court signed an order in connection therewith. As a result, on December10, 2019, the court paid $3 million 
to the City of San Bruno.The Utility continued fil
ing responses to the court’s additional requests in December 2019.On December 20, 2019, the court order
ed the Utility to state whether the Utility is in full compliance with two conditions of its probation: (1) the Utility must fullycomply with all applicable
 laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements; and (2) the Utility must fully comply with the specific targets andmetrics set forth in 
its wildfire mitigation plan. The Utility submitted its response to the court on January 15, 2020.On January 16, 2020, the court issued an orde
r to show cause noting that the Utility had admitted it was not in full compliance with the following conditions ofprobation: (1) fully comp
lying with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management; and (2) fully complying with specific targets and metrics set forth in itswildfire mitigation p
lan. The court set a show cause hearing for February 19, 2020, to discuss why a further condition of probation should not be imposed requiringthe Utility to hire suff
icient crews to enable it to fully comply with the laws and its wildfire mitigation plan concerning vegetation management. The Utilitysubmitted its response to th
e court on February 12, 2020.On January 24, 2020, the court issued an addi
tional order to show cause as to why, going forward, the Utility should not restrict all bonuses and other incentives forsupervisors and above exclusive
ly to achieving its wildfire mitigation plan and other safety goals. The Utility submitted its response to the court on February 12,2020. A hearing in connection with this o
rder is scheduled for February 19, 2020.On February 4, 2020, the court issued an orde
r directing the Utility to provide, by February 18, 2020, additional information in connection with the Utility’s priorresponses dated November 29, 2019, Decemb
er 19, 2019, and January 15, 2020, including regarding assets inspections and the condition of its electric assets.The Utility expects to cont
inue receiving additional orders from the court in the future.Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s Safety CultureOn August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprioritize safety 
and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate theUtility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organ
izational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record ofoperations, including its r
ecord of safety incidents. The SED engaged a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of a report containing theSED’s assessment, and subsequently, to repo
rt on the implementation by the Utility of the consultant’s recommendations.59

On May 8, 2017, the CPUC released the consultant’s report, accompanied by a scoping memo and ruling. The scoping memo established a second phase in the OIIin which the CPUC evaluated the safety 
recommendations of the consultant. Phase two of the proceeding also considered all necessary measures, including, but notlimited to, a potenti
al reduction of the Utility’s return on equity. On November 17, 2017, the CPUC issued further a phase two scoping memo and proceduralschedule. The scoping memo dir
ected the Utility to file testimony addressing a number of issues including: adoption of the safety recommendations from theconsultant, the Utility’s 
implementation process for the safety recommendations of the consultant, the Utility’s Board of Director’s actions and initiatives related tosafety culture and the co
nsultant’s recommendations, the Utility’s corrective action program, and the Utility’s response to certain specified safety incidents thatoccurred in 2013 through 2015.
The Utility’s testimony was subm
itted to the CPUC on January 8, 2018 and stated that the Utility agrees with all the recommendations of the consultant andsupports their adoption by the CPUC. Other part
ies’ responsive testimony was submitted on February 16, 2018, followed by the Utility’s rebuttal testimony onFebruary 23, 2018.
On November 29, 2018, the CPUC approved a decision that di
rected the Utility to implement the recommendations set forth in the May 2017 consultant report nolater than July 1, 2019, and to submi
t quarterly reports on the Utility’s implementation status beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018.On December 21, 2018, the CPUC issued another scoping me
mo and ruling expanding the proceeding and directing that the CPUC “will examine [PG&E’s]current corporate governance
, structure, and operations to determine if the utility is positioned to provide safe electrical and gas service, and will reviewalternatives to the current mana
gement and operational structures of providing electric and gas service in Northern California.”The CPUC alleged that the Utility has h
ad “serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years” and that despite penalties and otherremedial measures 
in connection with these problems, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have failed to develop “a comprehensive enterprise-wide approach toaddressing safety.” The scoping 
memo outlined a number of proposals to address the CPUC’s concerns regarding PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s safetyculture, including, but not l
imited to, (i) replacement of all or part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s existing boards of directors and corporate management,(ii) separating the Ut
ility’s gas and electric distribution and transmission businesses into separate companies, (iii) reorganizing the Utility into regional subsidiariesbased on regional distinct
ions, (iv) reconstituting the Utility as a publicly owned utility or utilities, (v) providing for entities other than the Utility to providegeneration services and 
(vi) conditioning the Utility’s return on equity on safety performance. The scoping memo did not propose penalties and stated that thisphase “is not a punitive phase.
” The Utility submitted its background filing to the CPUC on January 16, 2019 and opening comments were filed on February 13,2019. The Utility and other part
ies filed reply comments on February 28, 2019. The CPUC held workshops on April 15, 2019 and April 26, 2019.On June 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that direc
ted PG&E Corporation and the Utility to provide information about the safety experience andqualifications of ea
ch of the directors on their boards. PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed their response with the CPUC on July 3, 2019.On June 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting comm
ents from parties on four proposals that it stated may improve the safety culture of PG&ECorporation and the Utility. The 
four proposals are: separating the Utility into gas and electric utilities (including, as one possibility, sale of the gas assets to a thirdparty); establishing pe
riodic review of the Utility’s certificate of convenience and necessity; modifying or eliminating PG&E Corporation’s holding companystructure; and linking t
he Utility’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics.Opening comments on the ruling wer
e filed on July 19, 2019 and reply comments were filed on August 2, 2019.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict whether additional fines, penalties, or other regulatory actions may be taken, such as requiring the Utility toseparate its elec
tric and natural gas businesses, or restructure into separate entities, or undertake some other corporate restructuring, or transfer ownership of theUtility’s assets to mu
nicipalities or other public entities, or implement corporate governance changes.60

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power PlantThe Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant e
mploys a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the CentralCoast Regional Water Quality Cont
rol Board. In January 2000, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board issued a proposed draft cease and desistorder alleging that, a
lthough the permit’s temperature limit had never been exceeded, the discharge was not protective of beneficial uses. This issue was resolvedunder a tentative globa
l settlement addressing all aspects of the once-through cooling discharge that was initially approved in March 2003, but then later rejectedby the Central Coast Regional Wa
ter Quality Control Board. Subsequently, in 2010 the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling thatestablished specific 
compliance requirements. For Diablo Canyon, the policy set a compliance date of December 31, 2024, required an evaluation of the feasibilityand cost of alternativ
e technologies, and allowed for alternative compliance requirements. However, with the January 11, 2018 CPUC approval of Diablo Canyon’sretirement at the expiration of it
s existing NRC licenses, alternative compliance measures are no longer necessary. The policy still requires annual interimmitigation payments bas
ed on actual cooling water flow volume, which the Utility will continue to pay until operations cease in 2025.The Utility expects that 
its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility and the Central Coast RegionalWater Quality Control Board r
egarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that theultimate outcome of this matter 
will not have a material effect on the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY

MENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.65

The Utility’s base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case based on forecast costs. Differences between forecast costs and actualcosts can occur for numerous 
reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials. Differences incosts can also arise fro
m changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. Generally, differences between actual costs and forecast costs affect theUtility’s ability to e
arn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations below). The Utility’s basetransmission revenue requ
irements are recovered through a formula rate approved by FERC that trues up forecast and actual costs. However, for certain operatingcosts, such as costs associated wi
th pension benefits, the Utility is authorized to track the difference between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover orrefund the differenc
e through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below). The Utility alsocollects revenue requ
irements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity ornatural gas for its custo
mers. Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs thatdid not Impact Earnings” in Resu
lts of Operations below). See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1. Business for further discussion.This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities. Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included inItem 8.
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s Chapter 11 Cases are b
eing jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088(DM). For additional informa
tion regarding the Chapter 11 Cases, refer to the website maintained by Prime Clerk, LLC, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sclaims and noticing agen
t, at http://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge. The contents of this website are not incorporated into this document.For more information about 
the Chapter 11 Cases, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity” and Notes 2 and 5 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8 of this 2019 Form 10-K.Going Concern
The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates thecontinuity of operations, th
e realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utilitysuffered materia
l losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to the decision to file for Chapter 11protection. As a result of th
ese challenges, such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. For more information about the 2018Camp fire and 2017 Northern Califo
rnia wildfires, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Management has concluded th
at uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue asgoing concerns, and their indep
endent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ reports which states certainconditions exist which raise subs
tantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. TheConsolidated Financial State
ments do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. For more information about thesematters, see Notes 1 and 2 of th
e Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8.Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share
PG&E Corporation’s net loss attribu
table to common shareholders were $7.7 billion in 2019, compared to $6.9 billion in 2018. PG&E Corporation recognizedcharges of $11.4 billion for c
laims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire for the year endedDecember 31, 2019, compared to ch
arges of $14.0 billion, net of probable insurance recoveries of $2.2 billion, associated with third-party claims and legal andother costs related to 
the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires during the year ended December 31, 2018.66

Key Factors Affecting Financial ResultsPG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the followingfactors:
•
The Outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cas es, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is subject to the risks anduncertainties of bankrup
tcy. For example, the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect the Utility’s relationships with suppliers and employees which, inturn, could adversely aff
ect the value of the business and assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also haveincurred and expect to con
tinue to incur increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization. At thistime, it is not possible to p
redict with certainty the effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on their business or various creditors, or whether or when PG&ECorporation and the Utility wil
l emerge from bankruptcy. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations, liquidityand cash flows depend upon confirming, 
and successfully implementing, on a timely basis, a plan of reorganization. Although PG&E Corporation and theUtility have entered in
to settlement agreements to resolve the claims of the major classes of claimholders, including Utility debtholders, individualwildfire victims, holde
rs of subrogated insurance claims and certain public entities, non-consenting claimholders may still be able to challenge andotherwise impede the Proposed Plan. Th
ese settlement agreements could be terminated under various circumstances, some of which are beyond PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s control. In addition, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to emerge from Chapter 11 is dependent on their abilityto satisfy the conditions se
t forth in AB 1054, as determined by the CPUC. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the Proposed Plan meets therequirements of AB 1054 by, among other 
things, satisfying wildfire claims through settlements consistent with the terms of AB 1054, by keeping ratesneutral, on average, for 
the Utility’s customers, and by providing for the assumption of all power-purchase agreements, community-choice aggregationservicing agreements, 
and collective bargaining agreements. Finally, in order to emerge from Chapter 11, PG&E Corporation and the Utility must financethe Proposed Plan. There are nume
rous uncertainties related to such financings, including the ability to successfully raise equity or debt in the public orprivate markets, the 
ability to satisfy the terms and conditions set forth in the debt and equity commitment letters and the Noteholder RSA, the ability tocollect insurance pro
ceeds and the amount of additional capital that could be obtain to finance the Proposed Plan, including through securitization.•
The Utility’s Ability to Fund Ongoing Operations and Other Capital Needs. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas es, PG&E Corporation and the Utilityentered into the DIP Credit Agre
ement, which was approved on a final basis on March 27, 2019.  For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp
ect that the DIP Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand and cash flow from operations, will be the Utility’s primarysource of capital to fund ongo
ing operations and other capital needs and that they will have limited, if any, access to additional financing. In the event thatcash on hand, cash flow from opera
tions, and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet liquidity needs, PG&E Corporationand the Utility may be requ
ired to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available,offered on acceptabl
e terms.  The amount of any such additional financing could be limited by negative covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement, whichinclude restrictions on PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets.•
The Impact of the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2017 Northern California Wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility fa ce several uncertainties inconnection with the 2018 Camp fir
e and 2017 Northern California wildfires, related to:◦
the amount of possible loss related to third-party claims (as of December 31, 2019, the Utility’s best estimate of probable loss in connection withthe 2018 Camp fire, 2017 Northern Cali
fornia wildfires and 2015 Butte fire was $25.5 billion), which amount is subject to change based on anumber of factors, includ
ing whether existing settlements are upheld, whether any termination events are triggered under these agreements,whether the classific
ation and treatment of claims in the Proposed Plan is successfully challenged by claimholders who are not party to asettlement agree
ment, how the claims filed by Federal, state and local entities are resolved, and the ongoing criminal investigation with respectto the 2018 Camp fire;
◦
whether, in light of the CPUC July 8, 2019 final decision in the CHT OIR that excludes companies in Chapter 11 from accessing the CHT, theUtility will be able to obt
ain a substantial recovery of costs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires;◦
the impact of investigations, including criminal, regulatory, and SEC investigations;67

◦fines or penalties, which could be material, if any regulatory or law enforcement agency were to bring an enforcement action, including acriminal proceeding, 
and determine that the Utility had failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations;◦
the amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties, or damages in respect of future claims, which could be material;◦
the applicability of the doctrine of inverse condemnation in the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires litigation;◦
the applicability of other theories of liability, including negligence, related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfire claims;◦
the recoverability of the above-mentioned costs, even if a court decision imposes liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation;◦
the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to finance costs, expenses and other possible losses in respect of claims related to the 2018Camp fire and the 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires, through securitization mechanisms or otherwise; and◦
the amount and recoverability of clean-up and repair costs (the Utility incurred costs of $1.13 billion for clean-up and repair of the Utility’sfacilities through Dec
ember 31, 2019).(See Notes 4 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I.)•
The Impact of the 2019 Kincade Fire. Regardless of whether the Util ity is determined to have caused the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2019 Kincade fire couldhave numerous adverse consequen
ces to PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including, among others:◦
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to consummate the Proposed Plan by June 30, 2020 (or at all) could be impaired, and PG&ECorporation and the Utility m
ay not be able to amend the Proposed Plan, or develop another alternative to the Proposed Plan, that could beconfirmed by June 30, 2020 (or at a
ll);◦
depending on the number and type of structures damaged or destroyed by the 2019 Kincade fire or the amount of post-petition claims againstPG&E Corporation or the Utility as a 
result of the 2019 Kincade fire, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to satisfy, or obtain awaiver of, the conditions pre
cedent to the commitments under the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters, or theBackstop Parties or the Commit
ment Parties, respectively, may have the right to terminate such commitments, which would jeopardize PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to finance the Proposed Plan;◦
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain alternative financing to the transactions contemplated by the Backstop CommitmentLetters and the Debt Commit
ment Letters, and may not be able to obtain financing for an alternative plan that may be proposed by PG&ECorporation and the Utility a
fter the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire is better known;◦
the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows;◦
the 2019 Kincade fire may have adverse consequences on the Utility’s probation proceeding, the Utility’s proceedings with the CPUC and FERC(including the Safety Cultur
e OII and the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII), the criminal investigation into the 2018 Camp fire and future regulatoryproceedings, including futur
e applications for the safety certification required by AB 1054;◦
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience even greater difficulty in securing adequate insurance coverage for wildfire risks; and68

◦PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, andregulatory environment.
•
The Uncertainties in Connection with Any Future Wildfires, Wildfire Insurance, and AB 1054. While PG&E Corporation and the Util ity cannot predict theoccurrence, timing or 
extent of damages in connection with future wildfires, factors such as environmental conditions (including weather and vegetationconditions) and the efficac
y of wildfire risk mitigation initiatives are expected to influence the frequency and severity of future wildfires. Although thefinancial impact of future wil
dfires could be mitigated through insurance, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient wildfire insurance coverage at areasonable cost, or at a
ll, and any such coverage may include limitations that could result in substantial uninsured losses depending on the amount andtype of damages resulting 
from covered events. In addition, the policy reforms contemplated by AB 1054 are likely to affect the financial impact of futurewildfires on PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity should any such wildfires occur. The Wildfire Fund would be available to the Utility to pay eligible claimsfor liabilities arising from fut
ure wildfires and would serve as an alternative to traditional insurance products, provided that the Utility satisfies thenumerous conditions to the Util
ity’s participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds.However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s eligibility to accessrelief under the Wi
ldfire Fund (which is dependent on, among other things, the Chapter 11 Cases being resolved by June 30, 2020 pursuant to a plan orsimilar document not subj
ect to a stay and the Utility making its initial contribution thereto), the Utility’s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC thatwildfire-related 
costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable, and whether the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimatelyoutweigh its substantial costs. Th
e Utility may not be able to finance its required contributions to the Wildfire Fund, which consist of an initialcontribution of approxima
tely $4.8 billion and annual contributions of approximately $193 million. Finally, even if the Utility satisfies the eligibility andother requirements se
t forth in AB 1054, for eligible claims against the Utility arising between July 12, 2019 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11,the availability of 
the Wildfire Fund to pay such claims will be capped at 40% of the amount of such claims.•
The AB 1054 Deadline of June 30, 2020. In the event that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to confirm a plan of reorganization by June 30,2020, the Utility will not be el
igible to participate in the Wildfire Fund established under AB 1054. In that scenario, the Utility (i) would be unable to seekpayment from the Wild
fire Fund for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after the July 12, 2019 effective date of AB 1054 (which in the case of pre-emergence wildfires, su
ch as the 2019 Kincade fire, would be limited to 40% of such liabilities), (ii) would not receive the benefit of the 20%disallowance cap contemp
lated by AB 1054, (iii) would not be required to make any contributions to the Wildfire Fund, (iv) in applications for costrecovery for wildfires o
ccurring after July 12, 2019, would nevertheless be subject to review under the “just and reasonable” standard set forth in section451.1 of the Public Utilities Code (
i.e., the standard as modified by AB 1054) and (v) may still be eligible to obtain the annual safety certificationscontemplated by section 8389 o
f the Public Utilities Code (which has implications for the burden of proof in a proceeding for cost recovery under section451.1 of the Public Utilities Code).

•The Uncertainties Regarding the Impact of Recent and Future Public Safety Power Shutoffs. The Utility’s wildfire r isk mitigation initiatives involvesubstantial and ongoing expenditu
res and could involve other costs. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures andpotential other costs th
rough rates is uncertain. The PSPS program, one of the Utility’s wildfire risk mitigation initiatives outlined in the 2019 WildfireMitigation Plan, has been the sub
ject of significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California Governor, the CPUC and thecourt overseeing the Util
ity’s probation. On November 12, 2019, the CPUC issued an order to show cause why the Utility should not be sanctioned foralleged violations of la
w related to its communications with customers, coordination with local governments, and communications with critical facilitiesand public safety partne
rs during the PSPS events in late 2019. On November 13, 2019, the CPUC instituted an OII to examine 2019 PSPS events carriedout by California’s investor
-owned utilities and to consider enforcement actions. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing andoutcome of the OII and order 
to show cause, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedingsor other enforcement 
actions as well as to litigation and claims by customers, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments.On October 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
announced that they would issue credits to customers with respect to the October 9, 2019 PSPSevent. PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty recorded a charge of $86 million reflecting a one-time bill credit for customers impacted by the October 9, 2019PSPS event in the fourth quarter of 2019. As of th
e date of this filing, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect to issue any similar customercredits in connection with 
any other PSPS events (whether past events or in the future). If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits,rebates or other paymen
ts in connection with any other PSPS events (whether past events or in the future), the aggregate amount of any such credits,rebates, or other paymen
ts could be substantial and could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows. In addition, the proposals of SB 378, which would impose penalties and other requirements on electric utilitycompanies relating to PSPS events, cou
ld have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows. In addi
tion to other requirements, SB 378 would impose on an electric utility company a civil penalty of at least $250,000 per50,000 affected customers 
for every hour that a PSPS event is in place, would require the CPUC to establish a procedure for customers, local governmentsand others to recover costs 
accrued during a PSPS event from the electric utility company, which cost recovery would be borne by shareholders, andwould prohibit an electri
c utility company from billing customers for any nonfixed costs during a PSPS event. Further, the proposals of AB 1941 couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. AB 1941 proposes tosuspend RPS requirements, determin
e the savings to electric utility companies from the suspension and direct those savings towards system hardening tomitigate wildfire 
risks and PSPS impacts, and would prohibit salary increases or bonuses to executive officers during the suspension of RPS requirements.In addition, the PSPS program has had an adve
rse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation with customers, regulators andpolicymakers and future PSPS events m
ay increase these negative perceptions. In addition to the 2019 PSPS events, the Utility expects that PSPS eventswill be necessary in 2020 and futu
re years.•
The Costs of Other Wildfire Mitigation Efforts. In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have takenaggressive steps to mitig
ate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur and the impact of PSPS events. PG&ECorporation and the Utility in
curred approximately $2.6 billion in connection with the 2019 WMP, and expect to incur approximately $2.6 billion in 2020in connection with its 2020-2022 WMP. Although th
e Utility may seek cost recovery for certain of these expenses and capital expenditures, the Utility hasagreed not to seek rate 
recovery of certain wildfire-related expenses and capital expenditures in future applications in the amount of $1.625 billion.70

While PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking aggressive wildfire mitigation actions, if additional requirements are imposed that gobeyond current expectat
ions, such requirements could have a substantial impact on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity and c
ash flows. The Court in the Utility’s probation proceeding in connection with the Utility’s federal criminal proceeding hasimposed numerous obligations on th
e Utility related to its business and operations, including full compliance with all applicable laws concerningvegetation managemen
t and clearance requirements, submission to regular, unannounced inspections by the Monitor of the Utility’s vegetationmanagement efforts and equi
pment inspection, enhancement and repair efforts and the maintenance of traceable, verifiable, accurate and complete recordsof the Utility’s vegeta
tion management efforts and monthly reports to the Monitor on the status and progress of vegetation management efforts. OnJanuary 16, 2020, the Court proposed to requi
re the Utility to materially expand its vegetation management program, including through the hiring ofadditional employees. PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility also face uncertainties in connection with the amount and recoverability of enhanced andaccelerated inspe
ction costs of the Utility’s electric transmission and distribution assets (the Utility incurred costs of $773 million for enhanced andaccelerated inspe
ction and repair costs for the year ended December 31, 2019). (See “Order Instituting Investigation into the 2017 Northern CaliforniaWildfires and the 2018 Camp Fir
e” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)•
The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility’s financia l results may continue tobe impacted by the outcom
e of other current and future enforcement, litigation (to the extent not stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases), andregulatory matters, 
including those described above as well as the outcome of the locate and mark OII, the outcome of the safety culture OII, thesentencing terms of the Ut
ility’s January 27, 2017 federal criminal conviction, including the oversight of the Utility’s probation and the potentialrecommendations by the Moni
tor, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports. (See Note 15 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.) In addition, the Utility’s business profile and financial results could be impacted by the outcome of recentcalls for municipalization of 
part or all of the Utility’s businesses, offers by municipalities and other public entities to acquire the electric assets of theUtility within their resp
ective jurisdictions and calls for state intervention, including the possibility of a state takeover of the Utility. PG&E Corporationand the Utility cannot pred
ict the nature, occurrence, timing or extent of any such scenario, and there can be no assurance that any such scenario wouldnot involve significant ownersh
ip or management changes to PG&E Corporation or the Utility, including by the state of California.•
The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking Proceedings. The Utility’s financia l results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its 2020 GRC, FERCTO18, TO19, and TO20 rate cases, and its abili
ty to timely recover costs not currently in rates, including costs already incurred and future costs tracked inits CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, WMPMA, and FRMMA that are incurred in connection with th
e Utility’s 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, the amount ofwhich is approximately $2.6 bil
lion.  The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies,potential rate imp
acts, the Utility’s reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors.  (See Notes 4 and 15 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below.)•
The Utility’s Compliance with the CPUC Capital Structure. The CPUC’s capital structure dec isions require the Utility to maintain a 52% equity ratio onaverage over the period t
hat the authorized capital structure is in place, and to file an application for a waiver to the capital structure condition if anadverse financial ev
ent reduces its equity ratio by 1% or more. Due to the net charges recorded in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017Northern California wildfi
res as of December 31, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC an application for a waiver of the capital structure condition onFebruary 28, 2019. The waiver is subject 
to CPUC approval. The CPUC’s decisions state that the Utility shall not be considered in violation of theseconditions during the period th
e waiver application is pending resolution. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of its waiver application.(See “Regulatory Matters
” below.)For more information about 
the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, or that could cause futu
re results to differ from historical results, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this 2019 Form 10-K.  In addition, this 2019 Form 10-Kcontains forward-looking sta
tements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinionsthat are based on curren
t estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge offacts as of the date of 
this report.  See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results todiffer materia
lly.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to updateforward-looking statemen
ts, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.71

The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2019, 2018, and 2017.  The table separately identifies the revenuesand costs that impacted 
earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (suchas costs to purchase elec
tricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recoverthose pass-through costs, do not impa
ct earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as energy procurement costs) and thecorresponding revenues the Uti
lity is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.72

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assetsand to provide the Utility an oppo
rtunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incursto own and operate its assets.

 These items impacted earnings.Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings
The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2019, 2018, and 2017, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for theseperiods.
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $988 million, or 9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due toincreased base revenues 
authorized in the 2017 GRC, 2019 GT&S, and TO20 rate cases.  The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $39 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased baserevenues authorized in th
e 2017 GRC, partially offset by tax benefits resulting from the Tax Act expected to be returned to customers.Operating and Maintenance
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $1,692 million, or 31%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to $773million in costs rela
ted to enhanced and accelerated inspections and repairs of transmission and distribution assets, with no similar charges in the same period in2018. Additionally, the Utility r
ecorded $398 million in 2019 related to the Wildfires OII settlement, with no similar charge in the same period in 2018. Also, theUtility recorded $237 mil
lion in disallowed costs for previously incurred capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts in the 2019 GT&S rate case, with nosimilar charges in 2018.
73

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $363 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to $209 millionfor clean-up and repai
r costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, as compared to $17 million relating to the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires ch
arged in 2017. Also, the Utility recorded charges of $187 million in additional legal and other costs relating to the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires and the 2018 Camp fir
e (the Utility recorded $205 million for legal and other costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Campfire in 2018, as compared to $18 
million in 2017). The Utility also recorded charges of $121 million reflecting the additional write off of insurance premiums forsingle event coverage pol
icies (the Utility recorded $185 million in 2018 for the write off of insurance premiums, as compared to $64 million in 2017). Theseincreases were partially offset
 by a $38 million reduction to the estimated disallowance for gas-related capital costs that were expected to exceed authorizedamounts in 2018, compared to a $47 m
illion disallowance recorded in 2017 related to the Diablo Canyon settlement. Additionally, the increases were offset by adecrease in legal and o
ther costs relating to the 2015 Butte fire of $20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 (the Utility recorded $40 million for legal and other costsrelating to the 2015 Butte f
ire in 2018 as compared to $60 million in 2017).Wildfire-related cla
ims, net of insurance recoveriesCosts related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings decreased by $336 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The Utility recognized charges of $11.4 billion and $11.8billion in 2019 and 2018, respectiv
ely, for wildfire-related claims, net of probable insurance recoveries, primarily associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res.Costs related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings increased by $11.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2018, the Utility recognized charges of $14 billion, offsetby probable insurance recov
eries of $2.2 billion associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. In 2017, the Utility recognized acharge of $350 million, offs
et by probable insurance recoveries of $350 million related to the 2015 Butte fire.Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $197 million, or 6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to capitaladditions. The Utility’s depr
eciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $182 million, or 6%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due tocapital additions.
Interest Income
The Utility’s interest 
income increased by $8 million, or 11%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Utility’s interest income increased by $44 million, or 147%, in 2018as compared to 2017. The Utility
’s interest income is primarily affected by changes in regulatory balancing accounts and changes in interest rates.Interest Expense
The Utility’s interest 
expense decreased by $2 million, or 0%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Beginning January 29, 2019 in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, theUtility ceased record
ing interest on outstanding pre-petition debt subject to compromise. In the fourth quarter of 2019, following the Bankruptcy Court’s December30, 2019 memorandum decision in which 
it ruled that the UCC is entitled to post-petition interest at the Federal Judgment Rate of 2.59%, and pursuant to the termsof the Noteholder RSA, the Utility conc
luded that interest was probable of being an allowed claim and resumed recording interest on pre-petition debt subject tocompromise. The Utility’s 
interest expense increased by $37 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt.Other Income, Net
The Utility’s other incom
e, net decreased by $41 million, or 39%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in AFUDC due to equity ratio decreasesresulting from the Chapte
r 11 filing and wildfire loss accruals. The Utility’s other income, net increased by $39 million, or 60%, in 2018 as compared to 2017,primarily due to an inc

Income Tax ProvisionThe Utility’s income tax b
enefit increased $112 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher pre-tax losses. The Utility’s income tax p
rovision decreased $3.7 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in the income tax provision and increase in the effective tax ratewere primarily the r
esult of pre-tax losses in 2018 versus pre-tax income in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%as a result of the Tax Act.

these amounts will be recovered from orreturned to customers in future rates.  In 2019 and 2018, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the

Fluctuations in revenues tha
t did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information.Cost of Electricity
The Utility’s cost of ele
ctricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its owngeneration facili
ties, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gainsand losses on price risk manag
ement activities. Cost of electricity also includes net sales (Utility owned generation and third parties) in the CAISO electricitymarkets. (See Note 10 of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, netCAISO electricity market 
activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectricplants), and the cost-ef
fectiveness of each source of electricity.(in millions)

Cost of Natural GasThe Utility’s cost of natur
al gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-tradeprogram, and realized g
ains and losses on price risk management activities. (See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) TheUtility’s cost of natura

If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 2019, 2018,and 2017, no material amounts we
re incurred above authorized amounts.Other Income, Net
The Utility’s other inc

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RES
OURCESOverview
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. In connection with theChapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for $5.5 billion in senior securedsuperpriority debtor in possess
ion credit facilities in the form of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion (the “DIP Revolving Facility”),including a $1.5 billion let
ter of credit subfacility, (ii) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “DIP Initial Term Loan Facility”)and (iii) a delayed dr
aw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility,” together with the DIPRevolving Facility and the DIP Init
ial Term Loan Facility, the “DIP Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. On March 27, 2019, theBankruptcy Court approved the DIP Facili
ties on a final basis, authorizing the Utility to borrow up to the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including theremainder of the $1.5 bil
lion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, in each case subject tothe terms and conditions of 
the DIP Credit Agreement. (For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see “DIP Credit Agreement” below and Note 5 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.)For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cas
es, the Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures and pay other ongoing expenses and makedistributions to PG&E Corporation will p
rimarily depend on the levels of its operating cash flows and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement. The Utilityexpects that the DIP Facili
ties will provide it with sufficient liquidity to fund its ongoing operations, including its ability to provide safe service to customers,during the Chapter 11 Cases. For the dura
tion of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations and pay other ongoing expenses willprimarily depend on cash on hand 
and intercompany transfers. In the event that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s capital needs increase materially due tounexpected events or trans
actions, additional financing outside of the DIP Facilities may be required, which would be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.Such approval is not assured. For more 
information on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s material commitments for capital expenditures, see “RegulatoryMatters” below.
76

During 2018 and January 2019, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings were subject to multiple downgrades by Fitch, S&P and Moody’s including toratings below investment gr
ade and ultimately to “D” or low “C” ratings. In the first quarter of 2019, Moody’s and Fitch withdrew each of their credit ratings forPG&E Corporation and the Utility as a 
result of the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings ceasing to be rated atinvestment grade, the Uti
lity has been required to post collateral under its commodity purchase agreements and certain other obligations. In addition, PG&ECorporation and the Utility m
ay be required to post additional collateral in respect of certain other obligations, including workers’ compensation and environmentalremediation obligat
ions. (See Notes 10 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and theUtility maintain sepa
rate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.Financial Resources
Acceleration of Pre-Petit
ion Debt ObligationsThe commencement of th
e Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event with respect to, and caused an automatic and immediateacceleration of, th
e Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations. Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of theAccelerated Direct Financial 
Obligations, together with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediatelybecame due and payable. However, 
any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to theapplicable provisions of th
e Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the Utility’soutstanding senior notes, agre
ements in respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation’s term loan facility, as well as short-termborrowings under PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s revolving credit facilities and the Utility’s term loan facility disclosed in Note 5 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.DIP Credit Agreement
Borrowings under the DIP Facilities a
re senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Facilities are guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, andsuch guarantee is a senior s
ecured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Facilities will mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s optionto extend the maturity 
to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee. The Utility paid customaryfees and expenses in connect
ion with obtaining the DIP Facilities.On February 1, 2019, the Utility borrowed $350 mi
llion under the DIP Revolving Facility. On April 3, 2019, the Utility borrowed $1.5 billion under the DIP InitialTerm Loan Facility and re
ceived the proceeds of such borrowing, net of original issue discount and repayment of the $350 million in outstanding borrowings underthe DIP Revolving Facility. The DIP Initi
al Term Loan Facility matures on December 31, 2020 (subject to an extension option described further below) and bearsinterest at a spread o
f 225 basis points over LIBOR.On January 29, 2020, the Utility borrowed $500 mi
llion under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. As of February 13, 2020, the Utility had outstandingborrowings of $1.5 billion under the DIP Ini
tial Term Loan Facility, $500 million under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, and $751 million in faceamount of letters of c
redit outstanding under the DIP Revolving Facility. As of February 13, 2020, there were undrawn commitments of $2.7 billion on the DIPRevolving Facility.

Debt Commitment LettersOn October 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
entered into the Debt Commitment Letters with the Commitment Parties, which were subsequentlyamended on November 18, 2019, December 20, 2019, J
anuary 30, 2020, and February 14, 2020, pursuant to which the Commitment Parties committed to provide$10.825 billion in bridge financ
ing in the form of (a) a $5.825 billion senior secured bridge loan facility (the “OpCo Facility”) with the Utility or any domesticentity formed to hold al
l of the assets of the Utility upon emergence from bankruptcy as borrower thereunder and (b) a $5 billion senior unsecured bridge loanfacility (togethe
r with the OpCo Facility, the “Facilities”) with PG&E Corporation or any domestic entity formed to hold all of the assets of PG&E Corporationupon emergence from bankrup
tcy as borrower thereunder, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The commitments under the Debt CommitmentLetters will expire on August 29, 2020, unl
ess terminated earlier pursuant to the termination rights set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. PG&E Corporationand the Utility will pay custo
mary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the Facilities. If the entire $10.825 billion of bridge commitments remainoutstanding as of June 30, 2020, the aggreg
ate commitment fees payable by PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be approximately $75 million.In connection with the anti
cipated funding for the Proposed Plan and the anticipated amount of debt and equity to be used for funding thereunder, on February 14,2020, the Debt Commitment Lett
ers were amended to, among other things, (1) adjust the maximum amount of any roll-over, “take-back” or reinstated debtpermitted under the Fac
ilities from $30.0 billion to $33.35 billion at the Utility and from $7.0 billion to $5.0 billion at PG&E Corporation, (2) reduce the amount ofproceeds from the issuanc
e of equity that PG&E Corporation has to receive as a condition to funding from $12.0 billion to $9.0 billion, and (3) increase the amountof proceeds from the issuan
ce of debt securities or other debt for borrowed money as a condition to funding from $2.0 billion at PG&E Corporation to $6.0 billionat the Utility.
In lieu of entering into 
the Facilities, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to obtain permanent financing on or prior to emergence from bankruptcy in the formof bank facilities, deb
t securities or a combination of the foregoing. (See “Anticipated Sources and Uses for Chapter 11 Emergence and Related Financings” belowand “Plan of Reorganization, RSAs, Equity Backstop Com
mitments and Debt Commitment Letters” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
On October 23, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of the Debt Commitment Letters and certainrelated matters. Th
e hearing on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve the Backstop Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letters andcertain related 
matters is scheduled for February 26, 2020.Equity Financings
There were no issuances under th
e PG&E Corporation February 2017 equity distribution agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019. PG&E Corporation issued 8.9 million shar
es of common stock under the PG&E Corporation 401(k) plan and share-based compensation plans, for cash proceeds of$85 million, during the year 
ended December 31, 2019. The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. Beginning January 1, 2019,PG&E Corporation changed its defaul
t matching contributions under its 401(k) plan from PG&E Corporation common stock to cash. Beginning in March 2019, atPG&E Corporation’s directive, th
e 401(k) plan trustee began purchasing new shares in the PG&E Corporation common stock fund on the open market rather thandirectly from PG&E Corporation.
PG&E Corporation expects to issue new shar
es of PG&E Corporation common stock for up to $9.0 billion of proceeds at or prior to emergence from Chapter 11 inorder to finance the Proposed Pl
an. The structure, terms and conditions of any such equity issuance are expected to be determined by PG&E Corporation and theUtility at a later 
time in the Chapter 11 process, subject to the terms and conditions of the Backstop Commitment Letters. There can be no assurance that any suchequity offering would be success
ful. PG&E Corporation has obtained the Backstop Commitment Letters providing for equity funding of up to $12.0 billion tofinance the transac
tions contemplated by the Proposed Plan. In the event that new equity offerings do not raise at least $9.0 billion of proceeds, or if additionalcapital is required, PG&E Corpor
ation may draw on the Backstop Commitments for equity funding of up to $12.0 billion, subject to satisfaction or waiver by theBackstop Parties of the condit
ions set forth therein. (See “Anticipated Sources and Uses for Chapter 11 Emergence and Related Financings” below and “Plan ofReorganization, RSAs, Equity Backstop Commitm
ents and Debt Commitment Letters” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)The hearing on PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s motion to approve the Backstop Commitment Letters and certain related matters is scheduled for February26, 2020.

idated Financial Statements in Item 8.)(5) 
Trade Claims and Other Costs represents estimated trade claims and other costs, including trade payables and transaction fees, to be paid by PG&E Corporation or the Utility on the EffectiveDate.
(6) 
Accrued Interest represents the estimated amount of accrued interest that will be paid by PG&E Corporation or the Utility on the Effective Date.(7) 
Cash represents $750 million of cash remaining on the balance sheet as of the Effective Date.The table above does not includ
e $1.35 billion of payments to be made to the Fire Victim Trust after the Effective Date of the Proposed Plan pursuant to a taxbenefit monetizat
ion agreement. Pursuant to this tax benefit monetization agreement, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will use the first $1.35 billion of wildfire-related tax net oper
ating losses (the “Wildfire NOLs”) in order to make payments to the Fire Victim Trust, which payments are expected to be $650 million on orbefore January 15, 2021 and $700 mill
ion on or before January 15, 2022. In addition, the table above does not include any expected post-Effective Datesecuritization tr
ansaction. As described below under the heading “Potential Securitization Transaction,” the economic benefits of the Wildfire NOLs in excess ofthe first $1.35 billion would be used 
to support the expected post-Effective Date securitization transaction.Potential Securitization Transac
tionPG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct to file an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence $7.0 billion securitization transactionthat is rate-neutr
al, on average, to customers, with the proceeds used to refinance $6.0 billion of new Utility debt and fund a portion of the $1.35 billion paymentdue to the Fire Victim Trust pos
t-Effective Date. In this context, a securitization refers to a financing transaction where the Utility or a special purpose financingvehicle issues new debt that 
is secured by the proceeds of a new recovery charge to Utility customers. A rate-neutral securitization means that the Utility willpropose to offset the new recov
ery charges with customer credits, so that on a net present value basis, customers do not experience an increase in utility rates. TheUtility would be able to support th
ese credits based on the tax savings from the Wildfire NOLs and other sources. In other words, the funds retained by the Utilitythat would have otherwise been used 
to pay taxes can be used for other purposes, reducing the amount that the Utility needs to collect from customers (therebyusing the Wildfire NOLs to “fund” 
the credit).The foregoing description of 
anticipated sources and uses of funding for the Proposed Plan includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act, includ
ing statements about the expected sources and uses of funding, expected financing transactions (including the potentialsecuritization) and p
rojected balances of assets and liabilities (including cash on hand, accrued interest, trade payables and other amounts). This description reflectsPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
expectations as of the date of this filing and remains subject to change. (See “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginningof this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.(See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8.)80

Utility Cash FlowsThe Utility’s cash flows were as 
follows:Year Ended December 31,
 (in millions)

ctivities1,395  2,708  110  Net change in cash and cash equivalents
$ (173)  $848  $376  Operating Activities
The Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash.  During 2019, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $106 million compared to 2018. This increasewas due to a decrease in int
erest paid from $773 million to $7 million as a result of the automatic stay as of the Petition Date. Additionally, income taxes paiddecreased from $59 mil
lion in 2018 to zero in 2019. These decreases in amounts paid were offset by an increase in amounts paid for reorganization items, andenhanced and acceler
ated inspections and repairs of transmission and distribution assets in 2019, with no similar payments in 2018, partially offset by additionalamounts not paid due to the auto
matic stay as of the Petition Date.    During 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.2 billion compared to2017.  This decrease was due to an inc
rease in costs for clean-up and repair, and legal and other costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires, as well as enhanc
ed vegetation management work, and due to fluctuations in activities within the normal course of business such as the timing andamount of customer bill
ings and collections and vendor billings and payments. Additionally, the Utility paid $59 million in income taxes in 2018, as compared toreceiving a refund of $162 m
illion in 2017.The Utility will continue to op
erate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicableprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the o
rders of the Bankruptcy Court.  Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various ongoingactivities, including:
•
the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, andregulatory matters 
(see Note 14 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. andItem 3. Legal Proceedings fo
r more information);•
the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that are not currently being recovered inrates (see “Regulatory M
atters” below for more information);•
the timing and amount of premium payments related to wildfire insurance (see “Wildfire Insurance” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 fo
r more information);•
the Tax Act, which may accelerate the timing of federal tax payments and reduce revenue requirements, resulting in lower operating cash flows dependingon the timing of wildfire p
ayments; and•
the timing and outcomes of the 2020 GRC, FERC TO18, TO19 and TO20 rate cases, NDCTP, 2018 and 2019 CEMA filings, and other ratemaking andregulatory proceedings.

The Utility had material obligations outstanding as of the Petition Date, including claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.Any efforts to enforce such pay
ment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the BankruptcyCode and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Futur
e cash flows will be materially impacted by the timing and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing act
ivities decreased by $186 million during 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for capital expendituresas a result of the autom
atic stay as of the Petition Date. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $914 million during 2018 as compared to 2017 primarilydue to an increase of approx
imately $873 million in capital expenditures. The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new andreplacement fac
ilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers.  Cash used in investing activities also includes theproceeds from sales of nuc
lear decommissioning trust investments which are largely offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioningtrust investments.  The funds in 
the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling theUtility’s nuclear gene
ration facilities.Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurapproximately $7.6 billion 
in capital expenditures in 2020.Financing Activities
During 2019, net cash provided by financ
ing activities decreased by $1.3 billion as compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to $2.9 billion of netborrowings under revolving credi
t facilities in 2018, partially offset by $1.5 billion of net borrowings under the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility in 2019.Cash provided by or used in financing a
ctivities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operatingactivities, the lev
el of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments. 82

 Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt at contractual rates. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2019 and outstanding principal for eachinstrument with the terms ending at each instrument’s maturi
ty. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event under the long-term debtsummarized in the table above. For more information, see “Liquidity and Financ
ial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations” in Item 7. MD&A andNote 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statemen
ts in Item 8.(2)
 See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.(3)
 See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As theseannual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the amoun
t shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension andother benefit plans.
(4)
 Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock were suspended.  While the timing of cumulative dividend paymentsis uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.  (See Note 7 of the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item8.)         
The contractual comm
itments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t make reliable estimates of the amounts and periods of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognizedtax benefits.  Matters 
relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. (For more information, se
e “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations” in Item 7. MD&A.)Subject to certain exc
eptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assign or reject certain executory contracts andunexpired leases, subject 
to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract orunexpired lease is tre
ated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves PG&E Corporation andthe Utility of perform
ing their respective future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to apre-petition genera
l unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease willrequire PG&E Corporation or the Uti
lity, as applicable, to cure existing monetary and non-monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease andprovide adequate assuranc
e of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with PG&E Corporation or the Utilityin this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including wher
e applicable a quantification of the obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease, isqualified by any overriding 
assumption or rejection rights PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, has under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing hereinis or shall be deemed to be 
an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired leaseand PG&E Corporation and the Utility exp
ressly reserve all of their rights with respect thereto.83

Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsPG&E Corporation and the Utility do not hav
e any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on their fin
ancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources,other than those discussed under 
“Purchase Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATI
ON MATTERSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigationmatters described in Not
es 14 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. and Legal Proceedings in Item 3 that are incorporated byreference herein. Th
e outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows.U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court imposed a sentence on the Utility in connection with the conviction. The courtsentenced the Utility to 
a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by the Monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years, a fine of 
$3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained the Monitor 
at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the Monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain thesafety of its gas and
 electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis.On January 9, 2019, the court issued an orde
r (the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among otherthings, to:
•
prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-windconditions, . . . identify and fix 
all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]identify and fix damaged o
r weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its gridsimilar to any condition 
that contributed to any previous wildfires,”•
“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions” and•
at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the windconditions then prevailing.”
On January 30, 2019, the court found that th
e Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.Also, on January 30, 2019, the court ordered 
the Utility to submit to the court on February 6, 2019 the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that the Utility was requiredto submit to the CPUC by February 6, 2019 in accordan
ce with SB 901, and invited interested parties to comment on such plan by February 20, 2019.On March 5, 2019, the court issued an orde
r proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:•
“fully comply with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements;”•
“fully comply with the specific targets and metrics set forth in its wildfire mitigation plan, including with respect to enhanced vegetation management;”84

•submit to “regular, unannounced inspections” by the Monitor “of PG&E’s vegetation management efforts and equipment inspection, enhancement, andrepair efforts” in 
connection with a requirement that the Monitor “assess PG&E’s wildfire mitigation and wildfire safety work;”•
“maintain traceable, verifiable, accurate, and complete records of its vegetation management efforts” and report to the Monitor monthly on its vegetationmanagement status and prog
ress; and•
“ensure that sufficient resources, financial and personnel, including contractors and employees, are allocated to achieve the foregoing” and to forgoissuing “any dividends until [th
e Utility] is in compliance with all applicable vegetation management requirements as set forth above.”On April 3, 2019, the court issued an order 
imposing the new terms though amended the second condition to clarify that “[f]or purposes of this condition, theoperative wildfire m
itigation plan will be the plan ultimately approved by the CPUC.”On May 14, 2019, the court imposed two addition
al conditions of probation: (1) requiring that PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer,senior executives, the Moni
tor and U.S. Probation Officer visit the towns of Paradise and San Bruno “to gain a firsthand understanding of the harm inflicted onthose communities;” and 
(2) requiring that a committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors assume responsibility for tracking progress of the 2019Wildfire Mitigat
ion Plan and the additional terms of probation regarding wildfire safety, reporting in writing to the full Board at least quarterly. The court alsostated that it was not going to 
rule at this time on whether the court has authority to extend probation and would leave that question “in abeyance.” The court didnot discuss whether the Monitor r
eports should be made public. Members of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors and senior management attended site visits tothe Town of Paradise on June 7, 2019 and the City of San Bruno on Ju
ly 16, 2019, which were coordinated by the U.S. Probation Officer overseeing the Utility’sprobation. In addition, the Compl
iance and Public Policy Committee, a committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors, will be responsible for tracking theUtility’s progress against 
the Utility’s wildfire mitigation plan, as approved by the CPUC, and compliance with the terms of the Utility’s probation regardingwildfire safety.
On November 12, 2019, the court held a hea
ring related to the Utility’s San Bruno community service. At the hearing, representatives from San Bruno asked thecourt to approve allowing the Ut
ility to satisfy the remainder of its community service requirements by making a $3 million payment that would be used for thepurpose of hard costs incurred 
as part of the Crestmoor Canyon Wildfire Mitigation Project. The court approved the request and ordered the parties to jointly offerlanguage regarding revis
ing the Utility’s conditions of probation to effectuate this change. The parties conferred and agreed on proposed language, which theUtility submitted to the 
court as a proposed order on November 27, 2019. The court signed the proposed order that same day, and on December 10, 2019 confirmedreceipt of the $3 mil
lion payment from the Utility in compliance with the November 27th Order.On January 16, 2020, the court issued an orde
r to show cause noting that the Utility had admitted it was not in full compliance with the following conditions ofprobation: (1) fully comp
lying with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management; and (2) fully complying with specific targets and metrics set forth in itswildfire mitigation p
lan. The court set a show cause hearing for February 19, 2020, to discuss why a further condition of probation should not be imposed requiringthe Utility to hire suff
icient crews to enable it to fully comply with the laws and its wildfire mitigation plan concerning vegetation management. The Utilitysubmitted its response to th
e court on February 12, 2020.On January 24, 2020, the court issued an addi
tional order to show cause as to why, going forward, the Utility should not restrict all bonuses and other incentives forsupervisors and above exclusive
ly to achieving its wildfire mitigation plan and other safety goals. The Utility submitted its response to the court on February 12,2020. A hearing in connection with this o
rder is scheduled for February 19, 2020.On February 4, 2020, the court issued a requ
est for amended responses and further questions to be answered by the Utility relating to certain of the court’s requestsfor wildfire and PSPS related info
rmation. The Utility has until February 18, 2020 to submit its responses to these questions.85

REGULATORY MATTERSThe Utility is subject to subst
antial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of theproceedings described below and o
ther proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
Rate Cases
Application for Wildfire Mitiga
tion and Catastrophic Events Interim RatesOn February 7, 2020, the Utility filed 
an interim relief application seeking $899 million in interim rates related to certain electric distribution costs recorded in thefollowing memorandum accoun
ts: WMPMA, FRMMA, FHPMA, and CEMA. The costs pertain mainly to the years 2017-2019. The application addresses costsrecorded in: (i) the 
WMPMA and FRMMA to comply with the 2019 WMP and other wildfire mitigation costs not otherwise recoverable through rates, (ii) theFHMPA to comply with various fire safety 
rulemakings through 2019, and (iii) the CEMA for responding to, and restoring customer service after, certain stormsand fires occurring in 2019.
After removing the amounts 
agreed to be not subject for recovery pursuant to the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire OII settlementagreement (submitt
ed to the CPUC on December 17, 2019), the total electric distribution costs related to the above activities are approximately $1.7 billion inexpense and capital expend
itures. This amount translates to an electric distribution revenue requirement of approximately $1 billion. The interim rate relief soughtin this application is 85% o
f that revenue requirement. The Utility’s application calls for a CPUC decision by July of 2020. In its interim rate relief application, theUtility also proposes to fil
e one or more detailed application(s) with the CPUC to determine the reasonableness of the above-described costs later in 2020.If approved, by the CPUC, the interim r
elief request would increase electric distribution rates over a 17-month period beginning in August 2020. If the CPUCdetermines in those la
ter application(s) that the interim rates were too high, the Utility will refund any overcollections to customers with interest based on theapplicable commercial paper rate.
The Utility’s applicat
ion also requests a CPUC ruling that would allow for interim rate relief when the recorded balance in certain memorandum accounts exceedsa threshold of $100 million.
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this application.Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the W
ildfire Expense Memorandum AccountOn February 7, 2020, the Utility filed 
an application seeking recovery of certain costs recorded in the WEMA. In the application, the Utility seeks recovery of$498.7 million for the cost of 
insurance premiums paid by the Utility between July 26, 2017 through December 31, 2019 that is incremental to the insurance costsalready authorized in 
the 2017 GRC or sought to be authorized in rates in the 2020 GRC. These incremental costs are not associated with any specific wildfireevent. The application does no
t seek recovery of wildfire claims or associated legal costs eligible for recording to WEMA. The Utility has proposed a schedule forthe proceeding that requ
ests a final decision by the end of 2020 and costs to be recovered during 2021.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this application.Application for a Waiver of the Capital Structure Condit
ionThe CPUC’s capital structure dec
isions require the Utility to maintain a 52% equity ratio on average over the period that the authorized capital structure is in place,and to file an applica
tion for a waiver to the capital structure condition if an adverse financial event reduces its equity ratio by 1% or more.  The CPUC’s decisionsstate that the Utili
ty shall not be considered in violation of these conditions during the period the waiver application is pending resolution.  Due to the net chargesrecorded in connection with 
the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires as of December 31, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC anapplication for a waive
r of the capital structure condition on February 28, 2019.  The waiver is subject to CPUC approval.86

On April 30, 2019, the CPUC held a prehearing conference, and on May 29, 2019, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and ruling on issues for briefing.Subsequently, among other things, the Ut
ility filed a motion with the CPUC to notify the CPUC of a decline in its equity ratio to approximately 34% at June 30,2019. On November 12, 2019, the Utility submitt
ed a second motion to the CPUC to notify the CPUC of an additional decline in its equity ratio to approximately30.4%, based on information repo
rted in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, primarily related to non-cash chargesrelated to the 2018 Camp fi
re and the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The Utility submitted additional pleadings in December 2019, notifying the CPUC ofadditional charges due to 
the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, and describing the impacts on its equity percentage if the charges wereadded to the Utility’s fin
ancial information reported in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2019. However, the Utility indicated that itsequity percentage at De
cember 31, 2019 would not be known until the financial information for the period ending December 31, 2019 is reported in the 2019 Form10-K.
On November 20, 2019, the assigned ALJ issued a ruling wi
th questions for the Utility to answer. On January 21, 2020, the Utility filed responses to the questionspresented in the ALJ’s November 20, 2019 ru
ling. In its responses, among other things, the Utility recommended that the CPUC grant the Utility a waiver of thecapital structure 
condition, and transfer the issue of the Utility’s capital structure waiver to the OII to consider and resolve the continuance or end of the waiver inthat proceeding in connec
tion with the Utility’s Proposed Plan of Reorganization.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of its waiver application.2020 Cost of Capital Proceeding
On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final dec
ision in the 2020 Cost of Capital proceeding, maintaining the Utility’s return on common equity for thethree-year period beg
inning January 1, 2020 at 10.25%, as compared to 12% requested by the Utility. The Utility’s annual cost of capital adjustment mechanismalso remains unchanged. The de
cision maintains the common equity component of the Utility’s capital structure at 52%, as requested by the Utility, and reduces itspreferred stock componen
t from 1% to 0.5%, also as requested by the Utility. The decision also approves the cost of debt requested by the Utility.The following table compar
es the cost of capital currently authorized (in the Utility’s 2019 Gas Transmission and Storage rate case and the 2017 General RateCase) with those in the decision:
2019 Authorized
2020 Adopted Cost

4.89 % 47.00 % 2.30 % 5.16 % 47.50 % 2.45 % Weighted average cost of capital
7.69 % 7.81 % The Utility estimates that t
he Utility’s 2020 revenue requirement associated with the authorized cost of capital is approximately $30 million more than theauthorized revenue requ
irement at the 2019 authorized cost of capital.The decision does not take a posi
tion or establish any orders pertaining to whether the Utility should be required to submit a new cost of capital applicationfollowing its emergence 
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The decision defers that issue to the CPUC’s separate order instituting investigation into issues relating to theUtility’s bankruptcy.
2017 General Rate Case
On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Ut
ility’s 2017 GRC, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”)that the Utility is autho
rized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, andelectric genera
tion operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. The final decision approved, with certain modifications,the settlement agr
eement that the Utility, PAO, TURN, and 12 other intervening parties jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016. Consistent with theamounts proposed in the settl
ement agreement, the final decision approved a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of$444 million in 2018 and $361 million 
in 2019.87

On September 24, 2018, the CPUC approved the Utility’s advice letter proposal to make a one-time reduction to revenues by approximately $21 million. Thisadvice letter was dir
ected by an ALJ ruling in response to the Utility’s $300 million expense reduction announcement in January 2017.Also, as a result of the Tax Act, on Ma
rch 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC’s final decision in the 2017 GRC proposing to reducerevenue requirements by $267 
million and $296 million for 2018 and 2019, respectively, and increase rate base by $199 million and $425 million for 2018 and2019, respectively. On August 15, 2019, a final d
ecision on the PFM was issued directing the Utility to consult with the CPUC’s Energy Division to ensure that itscalculations include the co
st of removal component of book depreciation when calculating the amortization of protected excess deferred income taxes using theARAM and to quantify the amount of unprote
cted excess deferred taxes, which can be returned to ratepayers without following the ARAM. In compliance with thedecision, on September 13, 2019, the Uti
lity filed an advice letter with the revised calculations and the length of time the revenue requirement reductions would beamortized in rates. On Octob
er 17, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s advice letter approving a revised computation of the effects of the Tax Act on therevenue requirements, 
resulting in a $282 million reduction to the 2018 revenue requirement and a $291 million reduction to the 2019 revenue requirement. TheUtility will incorporat
e these revenue requirement reductions into rates beginning on January 1, 2020 and later in 2020, along with other anticipated changes, suchas the 2020 GRC phase one. The IRS is expected to provid
e additional guidance on ARAM. This IRS guidance may impact the Utility’s calculation of the relatedrevenue requirement. 
It is uncertain when the IRS guidance may be issued.The Utility provided an update o
f the cost effectiveness study for the SmartMeterTM Upgrade project to the CPUC on July 10, 2017. On October 24, 2019, theCPUC adopted a final decision that f
inds (i) the July 10, 2017 study is a thorough and complete update of the cost-effectiveness of the project and (ii) the Utilityshould submit an updated version of 
the cost effectiveness study as a stand-alone exhibit in each GRC Phase I application that the Utility files in the future.2020 General Rate Case
On December 20, 2019, the Utility toge
ther with the PAO, TURN, CUE, the CPUC’s Office of the Safety Advocate, the National Diversity Coalition, the Centerfor Accessible Technology, the Sm
all Business Utility Advocates, and California City County Street Light Association filed a motion with the CPUC seekingapproval of a settlem
ent agreement that resolves all of the issues raised by these parties in the Utility’s 2020 GRC.Revenue Requirements and Attrit
ion Year RevenuesThe settlement agre
ement proposes that the Utility’s 2019 authorized revenue requirement of $8.5 billion be increased by $575 million, effective January 1, 2020,to $9.1 billion. The settlem
ent agreement further provides for an increase of $318 million to the authorized 2020 revenue requirement in 2021 and an additionalincrease of $367 million 
in 2022, as shown in the table below.The table below summariz
es the differences between the amount of revenue requirement increases included in the Utility’s application on December 13, 2018, asupdated in its testimony on Novemb

requests in the GRC application (i.e., the CWSP and excess liability insurance costs), the settlement agreement includes the followingterms:
•
Funding of the Utility’s CWSP forecast through a new two-way Wildfire Mitigation Balancing Account. This would include the costs associated withoverhead system hardening and o
ther incremental costs of wildfire mitigations that are approved by the CPUC. A reasonableness review threshold wouldapply if the Utility wishes to 
recover costs beyond 115% of the adopted forecast or average unit cost.•
Combination of routine and enhanced vegetation management costs in a new two-way Vegetation Management Balancing Account to track and recordactual vegetation m
anagement costs (routine and enhanced) beyond the adopted level. A reasonableness review threshold would apply if the Utilitywishes to recover beyond 120% of the 
adopted forecast. This new account would replace the currently established one-way Vegetation ManagementBalancing Account that cover
ed costs for the routine program.•
A new two-way electric and gas Risk Transfer Balancing Account to record the difference between the amounts adopted for liability insurance premiumsand the Utility’s actua
l costs. This two-way account would allow the Utility to pass through actual insurance premium costs for up to $1.4 billion incoverage. The Utility could 
also request additional coverage through an advice letter and/or pursue self-insurance.Capital Additions and Rate Base
The settlement agre
ement assumes a 2020 weighted average rate base of approximately $29.4 billion for the portions of the Utility’s business reviewed in the GRC,compared with the Utility
’s original request of approximately $29.9 billion. The $0.5 billion difference is primarily due to the lower level of working capital,depreciation and other 
reductions in the settlement agreement. This rate base amount includes $601 million of forecast capital spend in 2020 that will not earn anequity return, pursuant to AB 1054. For the purpos
e of the settlement agreement, the Utility calculated a weighted average rate base of $31.0 billion and $33.0billion for 2021 and 2022, respect
ively. The Utility submitted its five-year financial forecast, including projected capital expenditure assumptions, in connectionwith its chapter 11 proceed
ings. While the Utility currently is evaluating capital expenditure assumptions, capital additions and rate base amounts may materiallyincrease from the current forecast.
89

Over the 2020-2022 GRC period, the settlement agreement provides average annual capital investments of approximately $4.6 billion in electric distribution,natural gas distribution
 and electric generation infrastructure. While the settlement agreement proposes overall revenue requirement increases for 2021 and 2022, itdoes not specify capital 
expenditures for those years.Consistent with the Utility’s GRC applic
ation, the settlement agreement does not propose funding for claims resulting from the 2017 Northern California wildfiresor the 2018 Camp fire. Also, the Util
ity is not seeking recovery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers.On December 2, 2019, the CPUC revised the procedur
al schedule for this proceeding.Opening and reply briefs on disputed 
issues outside of the settlement agreement were submitted to the CPUC by several parties on January 6, 2020 and January 27,2020, respectively. Opening and rep
ly comments on the settlement agreement were submitted to the CPUC by several parties on January 21, 2020 and February 5,2020, respectively.
As a result of the settle
ment and based on other facts and circumstances known to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp
ect to remain on track to satisfy the rate base conditions included in their exit financing documents.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.In accordance with a Janua
ry 16, 2020 CPUC decision in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to Evaluate Safety and ReliabilityImprovements and Revise the GRC Plan the d
ecision, the Utility is required to file with the CPUC on June 30, 2021 a single “general rate case” applicationrequesting integrated GRC and GT&S rel
ated revenue requirements for test year 2023 and three attrition years.2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
In its final decisions in 
the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014. This was theamount recorded in excess o
f the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered thatthe remaining $576 mill
ion be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding. TheUtility would be required to t
ake a charge in the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance.The audit is still in proc
ess. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the audit.As a result of the Tax Act, on March 30, 2018, 
the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC’s final decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case proposing toreduce revenue requir
ements by $58 million and increase rate base by $12 million for 2018 (excluding the impacts of an approximately $7 million increase inrevenue requirement 
and a $60 million increase in rate base associated with the Utility’s private letter ruling advice letter approved by the CPUC on July 18, 2018).On August 15, 2019, a final decision on the PFM was issued dir
ecting the Utility to consult with the CPUC’s Energy Division to ensure that its calculations includethe cost of removal compon
ent of book depreciation when calculating the amortization of protected excess deferred income taxes using the ARAM and to quantifythe amount of unprotected 
excess deferred taxes, which can be returned to ratepayers without following the ARAM. In compliance with the decision, on September13, 2019, the Utility filed an adv
ice letter with the revised calculations and the length of time the revenue requirement reductions would be amortized in rates. OnOctober 17, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s adv
ice letter approving a revised computation of the effects of the Tax Act on the revenue requirements,resulting in a $61 million 
reduction to the 2018 revenue requirement. The Utility incorporated the revenue requirement reduction into rates beginning January 1,2020. The IRS is expected to provide addi
tional guidance on ARAM. This IRS guidance may impact the Utility’s calculation of the related revenue requirement. Itis uncertain when the IRS guidance 
may be issued.2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
On September 12, 2019, the CPUC voted the final dec
ision in the 2019 GT&S rate case of the Utility. By approving the decision, the CPUC adopted a 2019revenue requirement o
f $1.332 billion compared to the Utility’s (revised) request of $1.485 billion. This corresponds to an increase of $31 million over the Utility’s2018 authorized revenue requ
irement of $1.301 billion, compared to the $184 million increase requested by the Utility. The CPUC also adopted revenuerequirements of $1.432 bill
ion for 2020, $1.516 billion for 2021, and $1.580 billion for 2022, compared to the Utility’s request of $1.595 billion for 2020, $1.693billion for 2021, and $1.679 billion fo
r 2022.90

The revenue requirement amounts requested by the Utility and the revenue requirement amounts in the decision are set forth in the following table:Revenue Requirement
(in millions)
2018 CurrentlyAuthorized
2019 2020 2021 2022 Utility’s Request
$ 1,301  $1,485  $1,595  $1,693  $1,679  Decision
$ 1,301  $1,332  $1,432  $1,516  $1,580  The decision removed from 
rate base approximately $304 million on a forecasted basis of pipeline replacement capital expenditures for the 2015-2018 period dueto cost overruns; the Utili
ty submitted updated recorded numbers to the CPUC that calculate the disallowance as $237 million. Incorporating the forecast reduction,the decision adopted a ra
te base for 2019 of $4.46 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $0.75 billion over the 2018 adopted rate base of $3.71 billion. Thisis compared to the Utili
ty’s rate base request of $4.75 billion for 2019. The decision adopted a rate base of $4.98 billion for 2020, $5.37 billion for 2021, and $5.71billion for 2022.
The rate base amounts also 
exclude approximately $576 million of capital spending subject to audit by the CPUC (related to 2011 through 2014 expenditures inexcess of amounts adopted in th
e 2011 GT&S rate case), pursuant to the 2015 GT&S rate case decision. The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million,or a portion thereof, will u
ltimately be approved by the CPUC and included in the Utility’s future rate base.The decision adopted capit
al expenditures of $726 million for 2019, which corresponds to a decrease of $104 million over the Utility’s request of $830 million.The decision adopted a post-t
est year ratemaking joint stipulation proposed by the Utility and PAO. The joint stipulation results in adopted capital expenditures of$697 million in 2020, $597 million in 2021, 
and $570 million in 2022.The decision adopted the Util
ity’s proposed Natural Gas Storage Strategy, with minor modifications related to the decommissioning or sale of the Utility’s LosMedanos and Pleasant Creek storag
e fields, and the decision adopted a two-way balancing account for storage costs, which will be subject to a reasonablenessreview in the next GT&S rate c
ase. The decision retained a number of existing memorandum accounts and one-way balancing accounts, including a one-wayexpense balancing account 
for transmission integrity management, and adopted 19 new expense and capital one-way balancing and memorandum accounts.The decision also resolved th
e second phase of this proceeding, addressing the removal of officer compensation costs from the revenue requirement, which isrequired by California Sena
te Bill 901. On this matter, the decision adopted the joint stipulation offered by the Utility, PAO and TURN that reduces the Utility’srequested 2019 GT&S operating expenses by $1.428 
million and capital expenditures by $0.455 million.On October 23, 2019, the Utility filed 
an application with the CPUC requesting the rehearing of the final decision. Specifically, issues identified by the Utilityinclude the adopted disal
lowance associated with vintage pipe replacement, reduction in the Utility’s expense forecast for in-line inspections, and establishment ofa memo account for Int
ernal Corrosion Direct Assessment. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of this matter.On January 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision 
in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to Evaluate Safety and ReliabilityImprovements and Revise the GRC Plan, as a 
result of which the Utility will be required to combine the GRC and GT&S rate cases starting with the 2023 GRCand 2023 GT&S rate case. In accord
ance with the decision, on June 30, 2021, the Utility is required to file with the CPUC a single “general rate case” applicationrequesting integrated GRC and GT&S rel
ated revenue requirements for test year 2023 and three attrition years.91

Transmission Owner Rate CasesTransmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appea
ls issued an opinion granting an appeal of FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases that hadgranted the Utility a 50 bas
is point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. Those rate case decisions were remanded to FERC for furtherproceedings consistent with th
e Court of Appeals’ opinion. On remand, FERC concluded that the Utility should no longer be authorized to receive the 50 basispoint ROE incentive adder, the Uti
lity would have incurred a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively. Alternatively, ifFERC again concluded that the Utili
ty should receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder and provided the additional explanation that the Ninth Circuit foundthe FERC’s prior decisions lacked, th
en the Utility would not owe any refunds for this issue for TO16 or TO17.On February 28, 2018, the Utility filed 
a motion to establish procedures on remand requesting additional briefing on the issues identified in the Ninth CircuitCourt’s opinion. On August 20, 2018, FERC issued an order granting the Ut
ility’s motion to allow for additional briefing. The order also consolidated the TO18rate case with TO16 and TO17 for this issu
e. The Utility filed initial briefs on September 19, 2018 and reply briefs on October 10, 2018. On July 18, 2019, FERCissued its order on remand r
eaffirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50 basis point ROE adder. On August 16, 2019, a number of parties filed forrehearing of that orde
r. As a result, on September 16, 2019, FERC extended the amount of time it has to consider the request for rehearing by issuing a tollingorder for the limit
ed purpose of further consideration of the matters raised in the request.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 r
ate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a $387million increase ove
r the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7 billion.  The Utility sought areturn on equity of 10.9%, which inc
luded an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, theUtility forecasted th
at it would make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order acc
epting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and setting it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyancefor settlement proc
edures.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017 and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  OnMarch 17, 2017, the FERC issued an order term
inating the settlement procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.  Duringthe hearings held in January 2018, 
the Utility, intervenors, and the FERC trial staff, addressed questions relating to return on equity, capital structure, depreciationrates, capital addi
tions, rate base, operating and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and the allocation of common, general and intangiblecosts.
Additionally, on March 31, 2017, interv
enors in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increasein the TO18 rate case. On November 16, 2017, th
e FERC dismissed the complaint. On December 18, 2017, the complainants filed a request for a rehearing of thatorder, which the FERC denied on May 17, 2018.
On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial d
ecision in the TO18 rate case proposing a ROE of 9.13% compared to the Utility’s request of 10.90%, and anestimated composite d
epreciation rate of 2.96% compared to the Utility’s request of 3.25%. The ALJ also rejected the Utility’s method of allocating common plantbetween CPUC and FERC jurisdiction. In addition, the ALJ proposed 
to reduce forecasted capital and expense spending to actual costs incurred for the rate caseperiod. Further, the ALJ proposed to re
move certain items from the Utility’s rate base and revenue requirement. The Utility and intervenors filed initial briefs onOctober 31, 2018, and reply briefs on Novemb
er 20, 2018, in response to the ALJ’s initial decision.Once the FERC issues its decision, the Util
ity expects one or more parties to seek rehearing of that decision and then appeal it to the courts. The Utility is unable topredict the timing and ou
tcome of this proceeding.92

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 r
ate case at the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.79 billion, a $74 millionincrease over the proposed 2017 
revenue requirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 was $6.9 billion.  The Utility soughtan ROE of 10.75%, which includes an incentiv
e component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the Utilityforecasted capita
l expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2017 filing, subject tohearing and refund, and estab
lished March 1, 2018 as the effective date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pendingsettlement discussion a
mong the parties. On May 14, 2018, the Utility filed a proposal to reflect the impact of the Tax Act on its TO tariff rates effective March 1,2018, in the resolution of the TO19 ra
te case. The tax impact reduces the TO19 requested revenue requirement from $1.79 billion to $1.66 billion.On September 29, 2017, intervenors in th
e TO19 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increase in theTO19 rate case. On October 17, 2017, the Util
ity requested that the FERC dismiss the complaint. On May 17, 2018, the FERC issued an order setting thecomplaint for hearing, 
initiating settlement judge procedures, and consolidating the complaint with the TO19 proceeding.On September 21, 2018, the Utility fi
led an all-party settlement with the FERC in connection with TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirementwill be set at 98.85% of the r
evenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon the issuance of a final, non-appealable TO18 decision. Additionally, if theFERC were to determine that the Ut
ility was not entitled to the 50 basis point incentive adder for the Utility’s continued CAISO participation, then the Utilitywould be obligated to make a r
efund to customers of approximately $25 million. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving the all-partysettlement. Additional
ly, on July 18, 2019, the FERC issued an order on remand reaffirming its grant of the Utility’s request for the 50 basis point incentive adderfor continued CAISO participation. On Sept
ember 30, 2019, the FERC issued an order on rehearing that denied a pending request for rehearing of the FERC’sdecision granting the 50 basis po
int ROE adder in the TO19 proceeding.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
On October 1, 2018, the Utility filed 
its TO20 rate case at FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with the Utility’s electrictransmission facili
ties. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and refund, andestablished May 1, 2019 as the ef
fective date for rate changes. FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussions amongthe parties.
The formula rate rep
laces the “stated rate” methodology that the Utility used in its previous TO rate case filings. The formula rate methodology still includes anauthorized revenue requ
irement and rate base for a given year, but it also provides for an annual update of the following year’s revenue requirement and rates inaccordance with the te
rms of the FERC-approved formula. Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenue requirements will be updated to the actual costof service annually as 
part of the true-up process. Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate will be either collected from orrefunded to customers.
In the filing, the Utili
ty forecasts a 2019 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.96 billion. The proposed amount reflects an approximately 9.5%increase over the as-
filed TO19 requested revenue requirement of $1.79 billion (a subsequent reduction to $1.66 billion was identified as a result of the Tax Act).The Utility forecasts th
at it will make investments of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion for 2018 and 2019, respectively, for various capital projects to beplaced in service befo
re the end of 2019. Including projects to be placed in service beyond 2019, the Utility forecasts total electric transmission capitalexpenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018 
and $1.4 billion in 2019. The Utility’s forecasted rate base for 2019 is approximately $8 billion on a weighted average basis,compared to the Utility
’s forecasted rate base of $6.9 billion in 2018. The Utility has requested that FERC approve a 12.5% return on equity (which includes anincentive component of 50 bas
is points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO), an increase from the 10.75% (also inclusive of a 50 basis pointCAISO incentive adder) requested 
in its TO19 rate case.93

On May 9, 2019, the Utility filed an application with the FERC requesting revisions to its TO20 rate case formula rate model to remove the impact of the non-cashwildfire-related charges on t
he ratio of common equity to total capital. The Utility indicates in its application that, because of the recording of the non-cashwildfire-related 
charges in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, the Utility’s financial statements reflected a ratio ofcommon equity to total c
apital of approximately 41% as of December 31, 2018. The Utility indicates that the proposed revisions adjust the equity ratio toaccurately refl
ect how the Utility financed the capital projects that are included in rate base. The Utility’s current rate base was financed with an equity ratio ofapproximately 52%, rath
er than the 41% equity ratio. In addition, on May 9, 2019, the Utility submitted a request to the FERC to exclude the wildfire charge fromthe Utility’s capita
l structure for the purpose of calculating its allowance for funds used during construction effective January 1, 2019.On July 10, 2019, the FERC accepted the Utility’s 
revisions to the formula rate to become effective December 9, 2019, subject to refund, established hearing andsettlement judge proc
edures, and reflected it with the Utility’s TO20 case.On November 27, 2019, the Utility filed 
its annual update filing under the TO20 Formula Rate for the rate year 2020 for the rates that will be effective January 1through December 31, 2020, subject to 
refund and true-up.The parties conducted seve
ral settlement conferences throughout 2019 and currently expect to file a partial settlement with the FERC no later than March 31, 2020.Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding
The Utility expects that 
the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses. Detailed studies of thecost to decommission the Uti
lity’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP. Actual decommissioning costsmay vary from these est
imates as a result of changes in assumptions such as regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment. TheUtility recovers its r
evenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue untilthose costs are fully re
covered.On December 13, 2018, the Utility submi
tted its 2018 NDCTP application, which includes a Diablo Canyon site-specific decommissioning cost estimate of $4.8billion to decommission th
e Diablo Canyon facilities.On February 14, 2019, the CPUC issued a scoping memo addressing 
the scope of the Utility’s 2018 NDCTP application to include the reasonableness of theDiablo Canyon decommissioning cost es
timate, ratemaking proposals, proposed Diablo Canyon milestone framework, plans to address host community needs,reasonableness of Humboldt Bay Power Plant d
ecommissioning costs, and reasonableness of performing Diablo Canyon planning activities pre-shutdown,including the proposed rate o
f recovery of these pre-planning activities addressed in the Utility’s application for authorization to establish the Diablo Canyondecommissioning planning me
morandum account (the “Diablo Canyon DPM account application”).On March 7, 2019, the CPUC amended the scoping memo to 
combine the Diablo Canyon DPM account application, which seeks authorization for the Utility toestablish the Diablo Canyon Decomm
issioning Memorandum Account to track funding for Diablo Canyon pre-shutdown decommissioning planning activities,with the 2018 NDCTP. The CPUC approved the Utility to establish an 
interim mechanism to track decommissioning planning activity expenses in the DiabloCanyon Decommissioning Memorandum Accoun
t. Any Memorandum Account recovery of such expenses is subject to the authorization and approval of theCPUC, which will be discussed in this year’s NDCTP. The assigned ALJ defe
rred the decision of cost recovery until after the NRC addresses the Utility’sDecember 13, 2018 exemption requ
est, in which the Utility requested an exemption to allow the Utility to withdraw from the NDT to fund decommissioningplanning activities. The CPUC held publi
c participation hearings on August 7 and 8, 2019 for residents and organizations in and near San Luis Obispo inconnection with the Utility
’s request.On September 10, 2019, the NRC issued a letter g
ranting the Utility’s request for an exemption and authorizing the Utility to access the NDT for up to $187.8million on decommissioning p
lanning activities. On October 4, 2019, the Utility submitted supplemental testimony to the NRC addressing how it proposes tomodify its request in ligh
t of the NRC exemption and the Utility’s proposed disposition of and ratemaking treatment of the planned Baywood Feed, a 12-kilovolttransmission line.
On October 24, 2019, the Utility and TURN requested a susp
ension of the procedural schedule in order to allow parties to continue settlement discussions. OnJanuary 10, 2020, the settlemen
t agreement that the parties had reached was filed with the CPUC, along with a joint motion for adoption of settlement agreement.94

Under the proposed settlement agreement, the Utility would collect annual revenue requirements of $112.5 million and $3.9 million over for the funding of theDiablo Canyon tax qualified trus
t and Humboldt Bay tax qualified trust, respectively, commencing January 1, 2020. Additionally, under the proposed settlementagreement, the $398.4 mil
lion spent for Humboldt Bay Power Plant decommissioning project costs completed to date would be deemed reasonable.The Utility is unable to det
ermine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Petition for Modification of CPUC Decision Approving Retir
ement of Diablo Canyon Power PlantOn June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties, including the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, to retire Diablo Canyon’s twonuclear power reactor un
its at the expiration of their current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025. On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the planned retirementby 2024 and 2025, but required legisla
tive authorization for certain key aspects of the joint proposal. On November 29, 2018, in response to SB 1090, the CPUCissued a further decision 
addressing the key remaining goals of the Diablo Canyon joint proposal agreement.On October 1, 2019, the Alliance for Nucl
ear Responsibility filed a PFM of the CPUC’s January 11, 2018 decision approving the planned retirement of DiabloCanyon. The PFM argues that above-marke
t costs attributable to Diablo Canyon under the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment methodology, when combinedwith decreasing bundled load by th
e Utility, create material changed circumstances that undermine the reasonableness of incurring costs to operate Diablo Canyonuntil its retirem
ent. On October 31, 2019, the Utility filed a joint response with Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, CUE, and IBEW Local1245, which argued that modific
ation of the CPUC’s initial decision is not warranted and is not in the public interest. On February 7, 2020, the ALJ issued a PDdenying the Alliance for Nucl
ear Responsibility’s PFM. The CPUC decision on the PD is anticipated no later than March 2020.Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account
On June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Uti
lity’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective asof July 26, 2017. In the WEMA, the Utility c
an record costs related to wildfires, including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles, co-insurance and other insuran
ce expenses paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been forecasted and adopted in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside legalcosts incurred in the def
ense of wildfire claims; (3) insurance premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts.  Insurance proceeds, as wellas any payments received 
from third parties, or through FERC authorized rates, will be credited to the WEMA as they are received.  The WEMA will not includethe Utility’s costs for f
ire response and infrastructure costs, which are tracked in the CEMA.  The decision does not grant the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate 
recovery would require CPUC authorization in a separate proceeding. (See Notes 4 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
As of December 31, 2019, the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements include long-term regulatory assets, consisting of insurance premium costs that are probable ofrecovery (see “Long-Ter
m Regulatory Assets” in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1). Should PG&E Corporation and theUtility conclude in futur
e periods that recovery of insurance premiums in excess of amounts included in authorized revenue requirements is no longer probable,PG&E Corporation and the Utility will 
record a charge in the period such conclusion is reached.Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Applications
The CPUC allows utilities to recover 
the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergencyby competent federal o
r state authorities through a CEMA. In 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetationmanagement work in response to 
the severe drought in California. The costs associated with this work are tracked in the CEMA. The Utility’s CEMA applicationsare subject to CPUC review and approval. For 
more information see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.2019 CEMA Application
On September 13, 2019, the Utility submi
tted to the CPUC its 2019 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $159.3 million in connection with thirteencatastrophic events th
at included twelve wildfires and one storm for declared emergencies from mid-2017 through 2018. The 2019 CEMA application does notinclude costs related 
to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire. A prehearing conference was held on November 4, 2019and a scoping memo was issued on Decemb
er 6, 2019.95

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing and outcome of this overall proceeding.2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophicevents that included fi
re and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017to cut back or remove dead o
r dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The 2018 CEMA application originallysought cost recovery of $555 mil
lion on a forecast basis, for additional tree mortality and fire risk mitigation work anticipated in 2018 and 2019, subject to true-upif actual costs were gr
eater or less than the forecast. However, on April 25, 2019, the CPUC adopted a decision denying cost recovery on a forecast basis for the2018 and 2019 costs requested.
On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s reques
t for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs (63% of the total costs incurredin 2016 and 2017), compared to $588 mil
lion requested by the Utility. The interim rate relief was implemented on October 1, 2019. Costs included in the interimrate relief ar
e subject to audit and refund. On August 7, 2019, the Utility filed a Revised Application, Revised Testimony and Revised Workpapers, reflecting anew revenue requirement 
request of $669 million, pursuant to CPUC ruling allowing these changes. The $669 million incorporates (i) the removal of forecast treemortality costs (redu
ction of approximately $555 million); (ii) inclusion of the 2018 Tree Mortality and Fire Risk Reduction activities (increase of approximately$90 million); and (iii
) other corrections and updates found since the filing (reduction of approximately $9 million), as compared to the Utility’s original request of$1.14 billion.
The 2018 CEMA application does not include 
costs related to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account
The CPUC allows utilities to track and 
record costs associated with implementing regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential firehazards associated with
 overhead power line facilities and nearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in another proceeding.The Utility tracked such cos
ts in the FHPMA through the end of 2019.On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of th
e CPUC, the CPUC’s Office of the Safety Advocate, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposedsettlement agree
ment in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, theUtility agrees, among othe
r things, to not seek recovery of $36 million of wildfire-related expenses recorded in the FHPMA. For more information on thesettlement agree
ment, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other than the amounts subjec
t to the settlement agreement in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, theUtility believes such costs 
are recoverable but rate recovery requires CPUC reasonableness review and authorization in a separate proceeding or through a GRC.For the amount recorded to th
is memorandum account as of December 31, 2019, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Fire Risk Mitigation Memorandum Account
On March 12, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s FRMMA to track 
costs incurred beginning January 1, 2019, for fire risk mitigation activities that are nototherwise covered in revenu
e requirements. The FRMMA was authorized by SB 901 and AB 1054 to capture mitigation costs of activities not included in a CPUCapproved Wildfire Mit
igation Plan.  The Utility has proposed that the FRMMA continue after the approval of its 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan to record costsof wildfire mitigat
ion activities that were beyond the initial identified scope of work.On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of th
e CPUC, the CPUC’s Office of the Safety Advocate, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposedsettlement agree
ment in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, theUtility agrees, among othe
r things, to not seek recovery of $236 million of wildfire-related expenses recorded in the FRMMA and the WMPMA. For moreinformation on the sett
lement agreement, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.96

Other than the amounts subject to the settlement agreement in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, theUtility intends to seek re
covery of the FRMMA balance in a future application, which rate recovery requires CPUC reasonableness review and authorization in aseparate proceeding or 
through a GRC. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could bematerially aff
ected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs in connection with the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan recorded in the FRMMA, which the Utilityexpects will be substantia
l.For the amount recorded to th
is memorandum account as of December 31, 2019, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Wildfire Mitigation Plan Me
morandum AccountOn June 5, 2019, the Utility submitted an 
advice letter to establish the WMPMA (also called the Wildfire Plan Memorandum Account) effective May 30, 2019.The purpose of the WMPMA is to track cos
ts incurred to implement the Utility’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan, as required by Public Utilities Code Sections 8386 etseq, as modified by SB 901 and subsequent bills 
including AB 1054, AB 111, SB 70, SB 167, SB 247, and SB 560. The WMPMA is required to be establishedupon approval of a utility’s wi
ldfire mitigation plan to track costs incurred to implement the plan. The CPUC approved the memorandum account on August 5,2019, so the Utility will record 
any costs incurred in implementing an approved Wildfire Mitigation Plan as of the effective date, June 5, 2019.On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of th
e CPUC, the CPUC’s Office of the Safety Advocate, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposedsettlement agree
ment in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, theUtility agrees, among othe
r things, to not seek recovery of $236 million of wildfire-related expenses recorded in the FRMMA and the WMPMA. For moreinformation on the sett
lement agreement, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other than the amounts subjec
t to the settlement agreement in connection with the OII into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, theUtility anticipates 
that the recovery of the costs recorded to the WMPMA would occur through a general rate case or future application at which time the CPUCwould review the costs for reason
ableness as required by SB 901. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity andcash flows could be materi
ally affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs in connection with the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan recorded in theWMPMA, which the Utility expects will b
e substantial.For the amount recorded to th
is memorandum account as of December 31, 2019, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Other Regulatory Proceedings
2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
On October 25, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to implement the p
rovisions of SB 901 related to electric utility wildfire mitigation plans. This OIR providedguidance on the form and cont
ent of the initial wildfire mitigation plans, provided a venue for review of the initial plans, and developed and refined the content ofand process for review and imp
lementation of wildfire mitigation plans to be filed in future years. In this proceeding the CPUC determined, among other things,how to interpret and apply SB 901’s list o
f required plan elements, as well as what additional elements beyond those required in SB 901 should be included in thewildfire mitigation p
lans. SB 901 also requires, among other things, that such plans include a description of the preventive strategies and programs to be adoptedby an electrical corporation t
o minimize the risk of its electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires, including the consideration of dynamic climatechange risks, plans for veget
ation management, and plans for inspections of the electrical corporation’s electrical infrastructure. The scope of this proceeding doesnot include utility re
covery of costs related to wildfire mitigation plans, which SB 901 requires to be addressed in separate rate recovery applications.97

On February 6, 2019, the Utility filed its wildfire mitigation plan (the “2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan”) with the CPUC. The 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plandescribes forecasted work 
and investments in 2019 that are designed to help further reduce the potential for wildfire ignitions associated with the Utility’s electricalequipment in high fire-
threat areas. The 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan includes measures the Utility proposed to take in 2019 and longer-term plans, subject tofurther modificat
ions, as follows:•
installing approximately 600 new, high-definition cameras, made available to Cal Fire and local fire officials, in high fire-threat areas by 2022, increasingcoverage across high fire-t
hreat areas to more than 90%;•
adding approximately 1,300 additional new weather stations by 2022, at a density of one station roughly every 20 circuit miles in high fire-threat areas;•
conducting enhanced safety inspections of electric infrastructure in high-fire threat areas, including approximately 735,000 electric towers and polesacross approximately 5,700 t
ransmission line miles and 25,200 distribution line miles;•
further enhancing vegetation management efforts across high and extreme fire-threat areas to address vegetation that poses higher potential for wildfirerisk, such as removi
ng or trimming trees from particular “at-risk” tree species that have exhibited a higher pattern of failing;•
continuing to disable automatic reclosing in high fire-threat areas during wildfire season and periods of high fire-risk and upgrading reclosers and circuitbreakers in high fire-threat area
s with remote control capabilities;•
expanding the PSPS to include all transmission and distribution lines in Tier 2 and Tier 3 High Fire-Threat District areas;•
installing stronger and more resilient poles and covered power lines, including targeted undergrounding, starting in areas with the highest fire risk,ultimately upgrading and s
trengthening approximately 7,100 miles over the next 10 years; and•
partnering with additional communities in high fire-threat areas to create new resilience zones that can power central community resources during a PSPS.On February 12, February 14, and April 25, 2019, the Util
ity filed amendments to the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan with the CPUC to correct inadvertent errors inthe cost table attached to t
he 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan; refine language in the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan; and modify certain 2019 Wildfire MitigationPlan targets.
On May 30, 2019, the CPUC adopted a decision that gener
ally approved the Utility’s 2019 Wildfire Mitigation plan as amended February 14, 2019, subject tocertain reporting, da
ta gathering, and other requirements set forth in the decision. Also, on May 30, 3019, the Utility adopted another decision regarding CaliforniaIOUs wildfire mitigation pl
ans, that among other things, includes additional reporting, data gathering, and other requirements. On June 14, 2019, the assigned commissioner 
and ALJ issued a decision implementing Phase 2 of the OIR, announcing Phase 2 workshops. The decision alsoannounced that the CPUC would evaluate the Ut
ility’s April 25th amendment in Phase 2, as well as the process for independent evaluation of the Utility’scompliance with its 2019 plan.
On August 23, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s Initia
l Safety Certification, which under AB 1054 entitles the Utility to certain benefits, including eligibilityfor a cap on wildfire f
und reimbursement and for a reformed prudent manager standard. The Utility satisfied the required elements for its Initial Safety Certificate,as follows: (i) the ele
ctrical corporation has an approved wildfire mitigation plan, (ii) the electrical corporation is in good standing, which can be satisfied by theelectrical corporation having a
greed to implement the findings of its most recent safety culture assessment, if applicable, (iii) the electrical corporation hasestablished a safety committee 
of its board of directors composed of members with relevant safety experience, and (iv) the electrical corporation has establishedboard-of-director-
level reporting to the CPUC on safety issues. The Initial Safety Certification is valid for twelve months.98

On September 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and ruling for Phase 2 setting the scope and procedural schedule. On December 16, 2019, the CPUCissued a ruling proposing WMP templ
ates and evaluative materials on which the CPUC would rely for 2020 wildfire mitigation plans. These included WMPGuidelines, a maturity mod
el, a utility survey, WMP metrics, and a supplemental data request. The utilities are required to complete the WMP Guidelines and theutility survey when submitting 
the 2020 WMP. Since December 16, 2019, the CPUC has held a number of workshops and issued clarifications of the December16, 2019 materials.
On February 5, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a PD in Phase 2 of this p
roceeding on electrical corporations’ wildfire mitigation plans. It resolves one Phase 2 issueby requiring all elec
trical corporations to conduct outreach to communities and the public before, during, and after a wildfire. If adopted, the PD would clarifyamong other things where the add
itional Phase 2 issues will be resolved: the CPUC’s newly created Wildfire Safety Division would review 2020 wildfiremitigation plans, presen
t resolutions for CPUC consideration on the 2020 Plans, and oversee independent evaluation and other compliance activity with regard toboth 2019 and 2020 Plans. Opening and reply commen
ts are due on February 25, 2020 and March 2, 2020, respectively. The CPUC decision on the PD is expectedno later than March 2020.
2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
On February 7, 2020, the Utility publicly pos
ted its 2020 Wildfire Mitigation Plan and utility survey. The Utility’s 2020 Wildfire Mitigation Plan describes theUtility’s wildfire saf
ety programs, which are focused on three key areas: reducing the potential for fires to be started by electrical equipment, reducing the potentialfor fires to spread, and m
inimizing the frequency, scope and duration of Public Safety Power Shut-off events, as well as providing historical data requested by theguidelines. The primary prog
rams include continuing enhanced vegetation management, system hardening, system automation, the wildfire safety operationscenter, installing add
itional situational awareness tools, and public safety power shutoffs, as well as working to reduce the frequency, scope, and duration of publicsafety power shutoffs. The Utili
ty plans to conduct enhanced vegetation management on approximately 1,800 miles of lines for 2020 and beyond based on insightsgained from the 2019 effor
t. The Utility is also incorporating the enhanced inspection process and tools from the 2019 wildfire safety inspection program into theroutine inspection and ma
intenance program. For 2020, the Utility plans the following improvements: hardening 241 line-miles for a total of 7,100 line miles over12 to 14 years; sectionali
zing 592 devices; making PSPS events fewer, smaller and shorter; installing 400 weather stations and 200 cameras; and operatingadditional microgrids du
ring PSPS events. The utility survey will be used to collect information relevant to track the utility’s capabilities in reducing wildfire riskand corresponding maturity 
levels over time. Along with other inputs, responses to the survey will establish a baseline maturity in 2020 and a target maturity for2023.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct the CPUC to issue a decision on its 2020-2022 WMP by June 2020. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs in connection with the 2019Wildfire Mitigat
ion Plan, and the 2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan recorded in the FRMMA and WMPMA, which the Utility expects will be substantial.OIR Regarding Microgrids
On September 19, 2019, the CPUC initiated a rul
emaking proceeding to examine microgrid implementation issues and resiliency strategies pursuant to SB 1339. Inthe first track of th
at proceeding, the CPUC is seeking to deploy resiliency planning in areas that are prone to outage events and wildfires, with the stated goal ofputting some microgrid and o
ther resiliency strategies in place by Spring or Summer 2020, if not sooner. A decision giving direction for mitigation measures readyfor implementation by Sep
tember 1, 2020 is expected in Spring 2020. At the CPUC’s direction, the Utility submitted a proposal for immediate implementation ofresiliency strateg
ies on January 21, 2020. The Utility’s proposal contains three components for which it is seeking scope and cost recovery authorization of up toapproximately $379 mill
ion in both expense and capital. These include:•
a make-ready program to invest in the infrastructure needed to allow high-priority substations and associated downstream infrastructure to operate asmicrogrids through the use of d
istributed generation (“DG”). The Utility is also conducting a Request for Offers for permanent DG to serve thesesubstations and plans to file 
for cost recovery and approval of any executed contracts for permanent generation through a separate CPUC proceeding;•
a temporary generation program to provide mobile, temporarily-sited DG at substations, mid-feeder line segments serving commercial corridors andcritical facilities, and single-cust
omer critical facilities during PSPS events; and•
a community microgrid enablement program to provide incremental technical and financial support on a prioritized basis for community-requestedmicrogrids for PSPS shutoff mitiga
tion purposes.99

Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of any costs incurred prior to the CPUC approval related to these proposals could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.OIR Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recover
y Pursuant to Senate Bill 901SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requir
es the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so thatthey do not exceed the maxi
mum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safeservice. SB 901 also authorizes th
e CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as“securitization”
), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excessof the CHT. SB 901 does not authorize securit
ization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CHT in futureapplications under Section 451.2
(a) of the Public Utilities Code for recovery of costs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.On March 29, 2019, the assigned commission
er issued a scoping memo, which confirmed that the CPUC in this proceeding would establish a CHT methodologyapplicable only to 2017 fir
es, to be invoked in connection with a future application for cost recovery, and would not determine a specific financial outcome in thisproceeding.
On July 8, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision in the CHT proceeding. The CPUC decision p
rovides that “[a]n electrical corporation that has filed for relief underchapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code m
ay not access the Stress Test to recover costs in an application under Section 451.2(b), because the Commission cannotdetermine the corpor
ation’s ‘financial status,’ which includes, among other considerations, its capital structure, liquidity needs, and liabilities, as required bySection 451.2(b).” This determ
ination effectively bars PG&E Corporation and the Utility from access to relief under the CHT during the pendency of the Chapter11 Cases. On August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted to 
the CPUC an application for rehearing of the decision. The Utility indicated in its application, among otherthings, that the CPUC’s decision “is cont
rary to law because it bars a utility that has filed for Chapter 11 from accessing the CHT, requires a utility to file a costrecovery application b
efore the CHT will be determined, and erects ratepayer protection mechanisms as an extra-statutory hurdle for accessing the CHT.” TheUtility also argued that 
the CPUC should apply the CHT methodology to costs related to the 2018 Camp fire.The decision otherwise adopts a 
methodology to determine the CHT based on: (1) the maximum additional debt that a utility can take on and maintain a minimuminvestment grade cred
it rating; (2) excess cash available to the utility; (3) a potential maximum regulatory adjustment of either 20% of the CHT or 5% of the totaldisallowed wildfire liab
ilities, whichever is greater; and (4) an adjustment to preserve for ratepayers any tax benefits associated with the CHT. The decision alsorequires a utility to 
include proposed ratepayer protection measures to mitigate harm to ratepayers as part of an application under section 451.2(b).Failure to obtain a substant
ial or full recovery of costs related to wildfires could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity and cash flows.OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Proposed Plan of Reorganization
On October 4, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to consider the r
atemaking and other implications “that will result from the confirmation of a plan of reorganizationand other regulatory approv
als necessary to resolve” the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Chapter 11 Proceedings OII”). The Chapter 11 Proceedings OII indicates that theproceeding will “afford p
arties the opportunity to be heard and comment on” any CPUC “regulatory review resulting from a proposed plan of reorganization(including any amendments
) filed with the Commission, any proposed settlement agreement resolving [the Chapter 11 Cases] between PG&E and Commissionstaff filed in connec
tion with a plan, any regulatory approvals required pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 3292 in order for PG&E to become eligible toparticipate in the wi
ldfire fund established pursuant to Assembly Bill 1054 (AB) 1054, any other regulatory approvals required by AB 1054, and any other mattersthat may need to be decid
ed by [the CPUC] in connection with a plan.” The OII anticipates that the proceeding “will serve as a venue for review of a proposed planand all attendant issues 
identified as within the scope of this proceeding.” The CPUC “expects to render its decision sufficiently in advance of the June 30, 2020statutory deadline cont
ained in AB 1054 to allow the Bankruptcy Court to address and approve any modifications made to the plan pursuant to Commissionorders.”
100

On November 14, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a scoping memo which divided the proceeding into two phases, first addressing non-financial issues(which include safety govern
ance, climate goals, procurement, and other non-financial issues) and then financial issues (which include ratemaking, fines andpenalties, financia
l governance, and other financial issues). After holding a status conference on December 20, 2019, the ALJ issued a ruling on December 27,2019 modifying the schedule. That 
ruling re-combined the two phases of the proceeding such that financial and non-financial issues will be considered together.On January 16, 2020, the Utility filed 
a motion to further modify the schedule, which the ALJ granted in part. Pursuant to that modified schedule, on January 31,2020, the Utility submitted t
estimony to the CPUC. The Utility’s testimony outlined key elements of the company’s updated Chapter 11 plan of reorganization,including, but not limited 
to, key aspects of the Utility’s governance structure; implementing a plan to regionalize the company’s operations; appointing anindependent safety advisor
; strengthening the roles of the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Safety Officer; utilizing an Independent Safety Oversight Committeewith non-PG&E Corporation and non-Utility e
mployees to provide independent review of the company’s operations; paying value in excess of $25.5 billion towildfire victims through 
the settlements reached; and emerging with a financing structure that seeks to protect customer rates and position the company for longterm success. Reply testi
mony was due February 14, 2020, evidentiary hearings are scheduled for February 19-28, 2020, and post-hearing briefing is scheduled forMarch 2020.
On January 22, 2020, the Utility enter
ed into a RSA with members of the Ad Hoc Committee of Senior Unsecured Noteholders of the Utility and, consistent withthat agreement, on Janua
ry 23, 2020, the Ad Hoc Committee of Senior Unsecured Noteholders of the Utility filed a motion to withdraw from the proceeding. OnJanuary 30, 2020, the ALJ issued a ruling al
lowing the Ad Hoc Committee of Senior Unsecured Noteholders to withdraw as a party.Wildfire Fund Non-Bypassable Charge
In response to directives 
in AB 1054, on July 26, 2019, the CPUC opened a new rulemaking to consider the authorization of a non-bypassable charge to support theWildfire Fund.  On October 24, 2019, the CPUC issued a fina
l decision finding that the imposition of the non-bypassable charge is just and reasonable. In addition,the decision affirm
ed that the Utility and its customers will not pay an allocated share of the adopted wildfire charge revenue requirement unless and until theUtility participat
es in the Wildfire Fund. The decision also continues the same allocation of the wildfire charge revenue requirement among the investor-ownedutilities as previously 
adopted for the Department of Water Resources power and bond charge revenue requirements. The decision proposes revenue requirementsfor the Utility of $404.6 mil
lion, which is based on average annual collections and shall expire at the end of the year 2035.On November 25, 2019, an individual interv
enor filed an application for rehearing of the decision arguing that the decision constitutes a constitutional violation ofprocedural due process and an un
just and unreasonable rate increase. On December 10, 2019, the Utility, along with San Diego Gas and Electric Company andSouthern California Edison Company argu
ed that due process rights were not violated and the CPUC appropriately determined the non-bypassable charge is justand reasonable.
Transportation Electrification
SB 350 requires the CPUC, in consultation with the Cal
ifornia Air Resources Board and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to file applications for programsand investments to acce
lerate widespread TE. In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TE applications that include bothshort-term projects 
(of up to $20 million in total) and two-to-five year programs with a requested revenue requirement determined by the Utility.On May 31, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision approving 
the Utility’s two-to-five year program proposals for actual expenditures up to approximately $269million (including $198 mi
llion of capital expenditures), to support utility-owned make-ready infrastructure supporting public fast charging and medium to heavy-duty fleets. In the EV Fleet prog
ram, the Utility has a goal of providing make-ready infrastructure at 700 sites supporting 6,500 vehicles, conducting operation andmaintenance of insta
lled infrastructure, and educating customers on the benefits of electric vehicles. The final decision gives customers the option of self-funding,installing, owning, and mainta
ining the make-ready infrastructure installed beyond the customer meter in lieu of utility ownership, after which they would receive autility rebate for 
a portion of those costs. The EV Fast Charge program has a goal to install utility-owned make-ready infrastructure at approximately 52 publiccharging sites amounting to 
roughly 234 DC fast chargers.On December 19, 2018, the CPUC initiated a new Rulem
aking for vehicle electrification matters (R.18-12-006). This new proceeding will include issues related toutility rate designs suppor
ting transportation electrification and hydrogen fueling stations, a framework for IOUs’ transportation electrification investments, andvehicle-grid integr
ation. A prehearing conference for this rulemaking was held on March 1, 2019. On May 2, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a scopingmemo and ruling for the pro
ceeding, which sets forth the category, issues to be addressed, and schedule of the proceeding.101

Electric Distribution Resources PlanAs required by California law, on July 1, 2015, 
the Utility filed its proposed electric DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s DRP identifies its approach foridentifying optimal lo
cations on its electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s DRP approach is designed to allow distributed energytechnologies to be integr
ated into the larger grid, while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service.On June 1, 2018 and on September 4, 2018, the Utility 
filed with the CPUC its first annual distribution grid needs assessment report and its first distributiondeferral opportunity r
eport, respectively. On February 5, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s proposal to competitively procure distribution services from third-party owned DERs to defer selected d
istribution projects as identified in the Utility's first annual distribution deferral report. On December 2, 2019, the Utility filedfor approval of three ex
ecuted DER contracts related to two deferral opportunities. The Utility's second annual distribution grid assessment, and distributiondeferral opportunity r
eport, were filed on August 15, 2019. On December 16, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s proposal to competitively procure distributionservices from third-p
arty owned DERs to defer selected distribution projects as identified in the Utility's second annual distribution deferral opportunity report.On March 26, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision r
equiring the Utility to include a grid modernization plan for integrating DERs in the Utility’s GRC.  OnDecember 13, 2018, the Utility f
iled its 2020 GRC Application, which includes the Utility’s grid modernization plan.OIR to Establish Policies, Processes, and Rules to Ensure Safe and Reliable Gas Systems 
in California and Perform Long-Term Gas PlanningOn January 16, 2020, the CPUC opened an OIR to address reliabi
lity and compliance standards for gas public utilities and impacts due to legislative mandates toaddress the greenhouse gas redu
ction emissions which will result in the replacement of gas-fuel technologies and reduced demand for natural gas. This proceedingwill examine whether re
cent industry related events will require the CPUC to change the rules, processes and regulations governing gas utilities, including but notlimited to, gas reli
ability standards, long-term contracting, regulatory accounting, reporting and tariff changes for operational flow orders.This proceeding is expected 
to have three phases: Track 1A - System Reliability Standards, Track 1B - Market Structure and Regulations and Track 2 - Long TermNatural Gas Policy and Planning. Additiona
lly, in Track 2, the CPUC will examine to what extent the projected gas demand reduction will require regulatorychanges, such as shortening the use
ful life of gas assets, to ensure gas transmission costs are fairly allocated and that stranded costs are mitigated. The CPUCexpects to issue a preli
minary scoping memo and decision for each track.Tracks 1A and 1B are expected to be 
completed within 18 months. Track 2 is expected to be resolved within 31 months in order to resolve issues to be consideredin Track 1A and 1B and coordinate with oth
er regulatory proceedings. This proceeding has been preliminarily designated as quasi-legislative. Evidentiary hearingsmay be necessary for Tra
ck 1A and Track 2. The Utility may file and serve opening comments on the preliminary scope no later than February 26, 2020 and replycomments on March 12, 2020.
OIR to Consider Strategies and Guidance for Climate Change Adaptation
On April 26, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to consider strategi
es for integrating climate change adaptation matters into relevant CPUC proceedings. On October10, 2018, the CPUC issued a scoping memo, establishing 
two phases for this proceeding, and determined a procedural schedule. Scope of phase one covers fivetopics regarding how to integr
ate climate change adaptation into the IOUs’ existing planning and operations to avoid or mitigate projected utility safety andreliability vulner
ability to forecasted climate change impacts. Phase 2 will be scoped at a later time, but it is not expected to apply to the Utility. On October 24,2019, the CPUC adopted a final decision ext
ending the statutory deadline of this proceeding to September 30, 2020.102

On October 24, 2019, the CPUC adopted a final decision on a portion of phase one (Topic 1 and 2), defining climate change adaptation for California’s energyutilities as “adjust
ment in natural and human systems to a new or changing environment. Adaptation to climate change for energy utilities regulated by the CPUCrefers to adjustment in utilit
y systems using strategic and data-driven consideration of actual or expected climatic impacts and stimuli or their effects on utilityplanning, facilities maintenance
 and construction, and communications, to maintain safe, reliable, affordable and resilient operations.” In addition, this decisionprovides guidance on what data should b
e used by the investor-owned utilities to perform all climate impact, climate risk, and climate vulnerability analysesundertaken with respect to 
their infrastructure assets, operations, and customer impacts. Finally, this decision requires the energy utilities to adhere to the sameclimate scenarios 
and projections used in the most recent California Statewide Climate Change Assessment when analyzing climate impacts, climate risk, andclimate vulnerabi
lity of utility systems, operations, and customers.The remaining topics in phas
e one of this proceeding are still under consideration and will be subject to a separate decision. Those issues include: guidance on howclimate adaptat
ion should be incorporated into the investor-owned utilities’ investment plans, program design, and operations; how climate change might affectvulnerable and disadvantag
ed communities; and into which specific CPUC proceedings and activities climate adaptation should be incorporated, includingdevelopment of specifi
c procedures. The CPUC decision on such issues is anticipated no earlier than mid-2020.OIR to Examine Utility De-energization of Power Lines in Dangerous Conditions
On December 13, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to examine the no
tification, mitigation, and reporting requirements on electric utilities when de-energizingpower lines in case of dangerous 
conditions that threaten life or property in California. This proceeding has focused on the following issues:•
examining conditions in which proactive and planned de-energization is practiced;•
developing best practices and ensuring an orderly and effective set of criteria for evaluating de-energization programs;•
ensuring electric utilities coordinate with state and local level first responders, and align their systems with the Standardized Emergency ManagementSystem framework;
•
mitigating the impact of de-energization on vulnerable populations;•
examining whether there are ways to reduce the need for de-energization;•
ensuring effective notice to affected stakeholders of possible de-energization and follow-up notice of actual de-energization; and•
ensuring consistency in notice and reporting of de-energization events.On May 30, 2019, the CPUC approved a decision for phase one of 
this proceeding, which adopted de-energization communication and notification guidelines forthe electric IOUs along with upd
ates to requirements established in Resolution ESRB-8. The CPUC also provided clarity on phase two issues; however, a finaldetermination of phase 
two issues will be conveyed in the phase two scoping memo. Phase two will take a more comprehensive look at de-energization practices,including mitigation, ad
ditional coordination across agencies, further refinements to findings in phase one, re-energization practices, and other matters.On August 14, 2019, the former CPUC president issued a phase 
two scoping memo. However, subsequent to the October PSPS events, on November 1, 2019, theALJ issued a ruling suspending the schedul
e and scope of the proceeding and indicating that the current CPUC president will issue an amended phase two scopingmemo in the near futur
e in order to refocus the direction of the proceeding.On December 19, 2019, CPUC president and newly assigned com
missioner issued an amended Phase 2 scoping memo and ruling. Pursuant to the ruling, the issuesto be considered in the am
ended Phase 2 include:•
updates or changes to existing PSPS guidelines to promote public safety in advance of the 2020 wildfire season;103

•proposed guidelines related to a variety of topics including (1) server and website capacity; (2) identification of transit corridors and critical transportationinfrastructure depend
ent on back-up generation during a PSPS event; (3) operations and locations of Community Resource Centers; (4) possible creationof a wildfire safety co
mmunity advisory board for each utility; (5) PSPS planning exercises in advance of wildfire season; (6) communication andnotification during PSPS events when commun
ication services may be disrupted; (7) assistance to medical baseline customers in the near term; (8) plansto better execute identification,
 communication, and contact with vulnerable populations that may not be considered medical baseline.On January 30, 2020, the CPUC proposed new guidelines. Parties a
re given the opportunity to submit opening and reply comments on the guidelines on February19, 2020 and February 26, 2020, respectively. A propos
ed decision is anticipated in May 2020.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding.Order to Show Cause Against the Utility Related to Implementa
tion of the October 2019 PSPS EventsOn November 12, 2019, the assigned commission
er and ALJ in the OIR to Examine Utility De-energization of Power Lines in Dangerous Conditions issued anorder to show cause directing 
the Utility to show cause why it should not be sanctioned for violations of law or CPUC decisions related to the PSPS events ofOctober 9-12, 2019 and October 23-November 1, 2019.
A prehearing conference was h
eld on December 4, 2019, and the assigned commissioner and ALJ issued a ruling on December 23, 2019 and set forth issues to bedetermined in the orde
r to show cause, including related to failures associated with the Utility’s website, online maps, data transfer portal, advanced notice tocustomers, and staffing a
t its call centers in connection with its October 9-12, PSPS event, as well as advance notice to customers in connection with the October23-25, 2019 and the October 26-November 1, 2019 PSPS event.
The Utility filed its t
estimony with the CPUC on February 5, 2020. Parties’ testimony is due February 28, 2020; concurrent rebuttal is due March 16, 2020; andhearings, if necessary, wil
l be held April 1-3, 2020.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing or outcome of this proceeding.OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to determine 
“whether California’s investor-owned utilities prioritized safety and complied with theCommission’s regulations and r
equirements with respect to their Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events in late 2019.” The first phase of this proceeding willassess for each utility, 
among other things, (1) the effectiveness of the utility’s procedures to notify the public of the PSPS events, (2) the utility’s communicationand coordination with first 
responders, local jurisdictions and state agencies, and (3) the utility’s management of its resources to ensure public safety. In laterphases of this proceeding, the CPUC may consid
er taking action if it finds violations of statutes or its decisions or general orders have been committed and toenforce compliance, 
if necessary.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing or outcome of this proceeding.Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR
In 2017, the CPUC initiated the PCIA Rulemaking to m
ake refinements to the PCIA, a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that customers that leave the Utility’sbundled service for a non-Uti
lity provider pay their fair share of the above market costs associated with long-term power purchase commitments and Utility-ownedgeneration made on thei
r behalf. The above market costs of the Utility’s generation portfolio are calculated using benchmarks for energy, resource adequacy (RA)and RPS attributes. On October 11, 2018, the CPUC approved a phase one d
ecision to modify the PCIA methodology establishing:•
calculation of the PCIA rate using benchmark values that more closely resemble actual market prices for RA and RPS;•
continued recovery of legacy Utility-owned generation costs from departed load customers;•
elimination of the 10-year limit on PCIA cost recovery for post-2002 Utility owned generation and certain storage costs; and•
an annual true-up of the PCIA rate based on actual market revenues.104

The Utility implemented a revised PCIA reflecting this decision in rates as of July 1, 2019.On December 19, 2018, the CPUC initiated Phase 2 of th
e PCIA proceeding to address unresolved issues from phase one, separated into three Working Groups. InWorking Group 1, the CPUC directed parties 
to (1) establish the method to annually update the RA and RPS price benchmarks, (2) determine the process for theannual true-up of PCIA rates to r
eflect actual market outcomes, and (3) determine the proper billing factors for setting the PCIA rate. A PD was issued onSeptember 6, 2019. On October 10, 2019, the CPUC approved a fina
l decision that:•
approves a methodology for annually setting the price benchmark for RA and RPS based on market transactions of all load-serving entities occurringwithin the past 12 months;
•
values any unsold RA and RPS attributes at zero for calculating the PCIA true-up at year end, meaning that bundled customers are not responsible forpaying for RA and RPS attributes that ar
e not needed for compliance; and•
establishes that the PCIA rates shall be calculated using the forecasted sales of customers in a particular billing group, rather than using system-levelsales, to prevent a persis
tent under-collection of PCIA rates.In Working Group 2, the CPUC directed parti
es to develop a framework evaluating and approving a PCIA prepayment framework, whereby departed loadcustomers could elimin
ate their PCIA obligation through an up-front payment. The working group issued a final report on December 9, 2019 containing proposedguiding principles that th
e CPUC should apply when reviewing prepayment applications. A PD is expected in the first quarter of 2020.Lastly, in Working Group 3 the CPUC directed pa
rties to develop structures and rules governing how the Utility addresses excess resources in its portfolio due toload loss to CCA and DA, including standards for ac
tive management of the Utility’s portfolios. A PD is expected in the third quarter of 2020.LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY IN
ITIATIVESSenate Bill 901
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requir
es the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so thatthey do not exceed the CHT. SB 901 also authoriz
es the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (alsoreferred to as “secu
ritization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, anyamounts in excess of the CHT. SB 901 does not authori
ze securitization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CHT in futureapplications under Section 451.2
(a) of the Public Utilities Code for recovery of costs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires. On March 29, 2019, theassigned commissioner issued 
a scoping memo, which confirmed that the CPUC in this proceeding would establish a CHT methodology applicable only to 2017fires, to be invoked in connec
tion with a future application for cost recovery, and would not determine a specific financial outcome in this proceeding. On July 8,2019, the CPUC issued a decision in the OIR, which establ
ishes a methodology to establish the CHT in future applications under Section 451.2(a), but determinesthat a utility that h
as filed for relief under Chapter 11 cannot access the CHT. On August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted to the CPUC an application for rehearing ofthe decision. The Utility ind
icated in its application, among other things, that the CPUC’s decision “is contrary to law because it bars a utility that has filed forChapter 11 from accessing th
e CHT, requires a utility to file a cost recovery application before the CHT will be determined, and erects ratepayer protectionmechanisms as an extra
-statutory hurdle for accessing the CHT.” The Utility also argued that the CPUC should apply the CHT methodology to costs related to the2018 Camp fire. (See “Regulatory M
atters - OIR Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901” above.)105

In addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  Thewildfire mitigation p
lan must include the components specified in SB 901, such as identification and prioritization of wildfire risks, and drivers for those risks;plans for vegetation man
agement; actions to harden the system, prepare for, and respond to events; and protocols for disabling reclosers and deenergizing thesystem.  The CPUC has three months to approve a u
tility’s plan, with the ability to extend the deadline.  The CPUC will conduct an annual compliance review,which will be supported by an independen
t evaluator’s report.  The CPUC will complete the compliance review within 18 months.  SB 901 establishes factors to beconsidered by the CPUC when setting penalti
es for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  Costs associated with the wildfire mitigation plan are tracked in amemorandum account, and th
e costs of implementing the plan will be assessed in each utility’s GRC proceeding, or other application proceedings.  The Utility isunable to predict the t
iming or outcome of the CPUC’s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire mitigationplan implementation, o
r the timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities. Subsequent bills including AB 1054, AB 111, SB 70, SB 167,SB 247, and SB 560, modified the wildfire mit
igation plan requirements, including expanding the plan coverage to three years, adding additional components andrequirements and trans
ferring review of the plans to a new Wildfire Safety Division of the CPUC beginning January 1, 2020, and later to an office in the NaturalResources Agency beginning July 1, 2021.
Assembly Bill 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed 
into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available foreligible electric utility companies t
o pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electricutility company’s equipm
ent, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Eligible claims are claims for third party damages resulting from any such wildfires,limited to the portion o
f such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any calendar year and (ii) the amount of insurance coveragerequired to be in place 
for the electric utility company pursuant to section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.Each of California’s la
rge investor-owned electric utility companies that are not currently subject to Chapter 11 (Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &Electric Company) has el
ected to participate in the Wildfire Fund to be established under AB 1054. On July 23, 2019, the Utility notified the CPUC of its intent toparticipate in the 
Wildfire Fund (which participation is subject to the conditions set forth in AB 1054, including those conditions outlined below).The Wildfire Fund to
 be established under AB 1054 will be available for eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising fromwildfires occurring after J
uly 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electric utility company’s equipment. Electric utility companies that draw from theWildfire Fund will only be requ
ired to repay amounts that are determined by the CPUC in an application for cost recovery not to be just and reasonable, subject toa rolling three-yea
r disallowance cap equal to 20% of the electric utility company’s transmission and distribution equity rate base. For the Utility, this disallowancecap is expected to be approx
imately $2.3 billion for the three-year period starting in 2019, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Utility’s total transmissionand distribution equit
y rate base. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that theelectric utili
ty company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard of the rights and safety of others,”or the electric ut
ility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC determines to be just and reasonable will not need to be repaid tothe Wildfire Fund, result
ing in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund. The Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts therein areexhausted. The Wildfire Fund is 
expected to be capitalized with (i) $10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the Department of WaterResources charge to ratep
ayers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three investor-owned electric utility companies, and (iii) $300 million inannual contributions paid by Cal
ifornia’s three investor-owned electric utility companies. The contributions from the investor-owned electric utility companies willbe effectively borne by 
their respective shareholders, as they will not be permitted to recover these costs from ratepayers. The costs of the initial and annualcontributions are allo
cated among the three investor-owned electric utility companies pursuant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation metric” set forth in AB 1054 basedon land area in the ap
plicable utility’s service territory classified as high fire threat districts and adjusted to account for risk mitigation efforts. The Utility’s initialWildfire Fund allocat
ion metric is expected to be 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions ofapproximately $193 mill
ion). In addition, all initial and annual contributions will be excluded from the measurement of the Utility’s authorized capital structure.The Wildfire Fund will only be av
ailable for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could bedepleted more quickly tha
n expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies.106

AB 1054 provides that the Wildfire Fund will be established when Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Company provide their initialcontributions. On September 11, 2019, Southern Ca
lifornia Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Company notified the CPUC that each had provided itsrespective initial contribution
 to the Wildfire Fund.In order to participa
te in the Wildfire Fund, within 60 days of the effective date of AB 1054, the Utility must obtain the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of theUtility’s election to p
ay the initial and annual Wildfire Fund contributions upon emergence from Chapter 11, which approval was granted by the Bankruptcy Courton August 26, 2019. The Utility would then be requir
ed to pay its share of the initial contribution to the Wildfire Fund upon emergence from Chapter 11, and meetcertain eligibil
ity requirements listed below, in order to participate in the Wildfire Fund. In such event (assuming the Utility satisfies the eligibility and otherrequirements set for
th in AB 1054), the Wildfire Fund will be available to the Utility to pay for eligible claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 andthe Utility’s emergen
ce from Chapter 11, subject to a limit of 40% of the amount of such claims. The balance of any such claims would need to be addressedthrough the Chapter 11 Cases. There a
re several additional eligibility requirements for the Utility, including that by June 30, 2020, the following conditions aresatisfied:
•
the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case has been resolved pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar document not subject to a stay;•
the Bankruptcy Court has determined that the resolution of the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case provides funding or otherwise provides for the satisfaction ofany pre-petition wildfi
re claims asserted against the Utility in the Chapter 11 Case, in the amounts agreed upon in any settlement agreements, authorizedby the Bankruptcy Court through an esti
mation process or otherwise allowed by the Bankruptcy Court;•
the CPUC has approved the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case, including the Utility’s resultinggovernance structure as 
being acceptable in light of the Utility’s safety history, criminal probation, recent financial condition and other factors deemedrelevant by the CPUC;
•
the CPUC has determined that the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case are (i) consistent with California’sclimate goals as requ
ired pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program and related procurement requirements and (ii) neutral, onaverage, to the Utility
’s ratepayers; and•
the CPUC has determined that the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case recognize the contributions ofratepayers, if any, and co
mpensate them accordingly through mechanisms approved by the CPUC, which may include sharing of value appreciation.On August 23, 2019, the CPUC granted the Utility its Init
ial Safety Certification, which is valid for 12 months. While not a requirement for participation in theWildfire Fund, a valid saf
ety certification allows the Utility to benefit from AB 1054’s disallowance cap. (See “Regulatory Matters - 2019 Wildfire MitigationPlan” above.)
On August 7, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility submit
ted a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for the entry of an order authorizing PG&E Corporation andthe Utility to partic
ipate in the Wildfire Fund and to make any initial and annual contributions to the Wildfire Fund upon emergence from Chapter 11. On August26, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an o
rder granting such authorizations.If the Utility satisf
ies the requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund, the Utility will be required to fund its initial contribution upon its emergence fromChapter 11. The Utility’s requi
red contributions to the Wildfire Fund will be substantial. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. The Utility is currently evaluating the tax treatment of therequired initial and 
annual contributions. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with shareholder contributions would also depend on variousfactors, including the t
iming of resolution of the Chapter 11 Cases, the expected life of the Wildfire Fund, and the impact of future wildfires on the Wildfire Fund'sclaims passing capaci
ty. The Proposed Plan filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 31, 2020 would provide for the financing of such required contributions,but there can be no assuranc
e that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will successfully consummate or implement any such plan, which will ultimately requireBankruptcy Court, creditor and r
egulatory approval. Further, there can be no assurance that the expected benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimatelyoutweigh its substantial costs.
107

The Utility expects to record its required contributions as an asset and amortize the asset over the estimated life of the Wildfire Fund. The Wildfire Fund asset willbe further adjusted for 
impairment as the assets are used to pay eligible claims, which will result in decreases to the assets available for coverage of future events.AB 1054 does not establish a definite 
term of the Wildfire Fund; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant judgments and estimates. Theassumptions create a hig
h degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The most significant estimate is the number and severityof catastrophic fires that co
uld occur in California within the participating electric utilities’ service territories during the term of the Wildfire Fund. The Utilityintends to utilize historical
, publicly available fire-loss data as a starting point; however, future fire-loss can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties around theimpacts of climate change, lan
d use changes, and mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies. Other assumptions include the estimated cost ofwildfires caused by other e
lectric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claims will be settled, the likely adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-causedwildfires, the level of 
future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of other electricutilities. Significant chan
ges in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period. There could also be a significant delay between theoccurrence of a wildfi
re and the timing of which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to theUtility following a catas
trophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another electric utility. As of December 31, 2019, the Utility hasnot reflected the r
equired contributions in its Consolidated Financial Statements as it has not yet satisfied all of the Wildfire Fund eligibility criteria pursuant to AB1054.
AB 1054 includes certain modifi
cations to the “just and reasonable” standard to be utilized by the CPUC in determining applications for recovery of wildfire-related costs. These modi
fications will apply to wildfires occurring following the effective date of AB 1054. AB 1054 provides that costs and expenses arisingfrom any such wildfires “a
re just and reasonable if the conduct of the electrical corporation related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonableutility would have 
undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available to the electricalcorporation at the re
levant point of time.” Further, in applying such standard, the CPUC is directed to take into account factors “both within and beyond theutility’s control tha
t may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds.” Finally, AB 1054 modifies the circumstancesunder which an electric u
tility company bears the burden of demonstrating that its conduct was reasonable in accordance with the above standard.AB 1054 also provides that the first $5.0 b
illion expended in the aggregate by California’s three investor-owned electric utility companies on fire risk mitigationcapital expenditures 
included in their respective approved wildfire mitigation plans will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion ofcapital expenditures will 
be allocated among the investor-owned electric utility companies in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics (describedabove). AB 1054 contemplates that su
ch capital expenditures may be securitized through a customer charge.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility’s personnel and 
the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardouswastes; the reporting and r
eduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety andreliability measu
res for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors,“Environmental Regulation
” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.)
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourageunauthorized risk-taking, 
reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e.,risk mitigation) and not 
for speculative purposes.108

Commodity Price RiskThe Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas andnuclear fuel necessary for electricit
y generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use ofphysical and financial 
instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can concludethat it is probable that it
s reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and naturalgas prices will not affe
ct earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customersare also fully recoverable thr
ough a ratemaking mechanism.The Utility’s current au
thorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected. The Utility recovers thes
e costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,resulting in price and volu
metric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk wasapproximately $9 mill
ion and $11 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8. for further dis
cussion of price risk management activities.)Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest rates. At Dece
mber 31, 2019 and 2018, if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt,and cash investments, the i
mpact on net income over the next 12 months would be $45 million and $24 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt andother interest rat
e-sensitive instruments outstanding. (See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for further discussion of interestrates.)
Energy Procurement Credit Risk
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas, including the CAISO market, other Californiainvestor-owned electric utilitie
s, municipal utilities, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gasproduction companies loca
ted in the United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then theUtility may find it neces
sary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, creditratings, and other credit
 criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contractsunder master commodity ena
bling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below). Credit collateral may be in the formof cash or letters of credit
. The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or othereligible securities (as deemed a
ppropriate by the Utility). Credit collateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current netreceivables and replacement cost
 exposure exceed contractually specified limits.The following table summar

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recordedamounts of assets and liabi
lities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Theaccounting policies desc
ribed below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant andmaterial to the f
inancial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgmentsand estimates. Actual res
ults may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting policies and their key characteristics are outlinedbelow.
Liabilities Subject to Compromise
As a result of the commenc
ement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities is subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to a plan ofreorganization. The det
ermination of how liabilities will ultimately be settled or treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court confirms a Chapter 11 plan ofreorganization and such pl
an becomes effective. Accordingly, the ultimate amount of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. GAAP requires pre-petitionliabilities that 
are subject to compromise to be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for differentamounts. The amounts current
ly classified as LSTC are preliminary and may be subject to future adjustments depending on Bankruptcy Court actions, furtherdevelopments with respect 
to disputed claims, determinations of the secured status of certain claims, the values of any collateral securing such claims, rejection ofexecutory contracts, con
tinued reconciliation or other events.Loss Contingencies
As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, andenvironmental remediation liabilities
. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.Wildfire-Related Liabilities
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability whenit determines that 
a loss is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless anamount within the range is a b
etter estimate than any other amount. Potential liabilit
ies related to wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to negotiations and settlements or the cause of each fire, contributingcauses of the fires (in
cluding alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, thecontents of such structures 
and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature andextent of any personal inju
ries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damagesthe Utility may be responsib
le for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number ofunknown facts and legal consider
ations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be assertedagainst PG&E Corporation or the Util
ity, the number of current and future claims that will be included in a plan of reorganization, and how claims for punitivedamages and claims by var
iously situated persons will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed.The process for estimatin
g wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including but not l
imited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  (See Note14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.)110

Enforcement and Litigation MattersPG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims andlawsuits. In addition, penalt
ies may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record aprovision for a loss contingency when 
it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluat
e the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is abetter estimate 
than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,often involves a series of 
complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of allknown information, such as negotia
tions, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to aparticular matt
er. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actualresults may differ m
aterially from these estimates and assumptions. (See Note 14 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)Environmental Remediation Liabiliti
esThe Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to payfor environmental re
mediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for thestorage, recycling, or dispos
al of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.The Utility generally comme
nces the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
 (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperationwith regulatory agencies. For 
example, the Utility has a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.) Based on such notification, the Utilitycompletes an assessment 
of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records anenvironmental remed
iation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remedi
ation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types ofhazardous substances at a pot
ential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to otherresponsible parties, and th
e extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending onthe level of informa
tion available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a si
gnificant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenance
 activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.Remediation efforts fo
r a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process maychange, as well as site condi
tions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.111

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion. The Utility’s undiscounted future costscould increase to as much 
as $2.4 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsibleparties are not finan
cially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements. Althoughthe Utility has provided for known env
ironmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs,and the amount of additiona
l future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.Insurance Receivable
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. The Utility records insurance recoveries only when athird-party claim 
is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  Theassessment of whether recov
ery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series ofcomplex judgments abo
ut future events.  Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information,including contractual 
liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, discussions with insurers and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. (See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 14 and “Insurance” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
Regulatory Accounting
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despitethe ongoing losses related to wi
ldfires (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), there is no actual or anticipated change in the cost ofservice regulation of 
the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated Operations . These amounts would otherwise be recorded to exp
ense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 3 as well as Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8. At December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatorybalancing accounts rec
eivable) of $8.5 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $11.2 billion.Determining probability 
requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatoryhearings, proposed regulatory d
ecisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of theUtility’s regulatory asset
s, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from theCPUC. The Utility also records a regula
tory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery ofincurred costs is probable, su
ch as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt. The CPUC has not denied th
e recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented. Ifthe Utility determin
ed that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rateregulation, the regula
tory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accounting did not apply, theUtility’s future financial res
ults could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenuerecognition.
A portion of the Utility's regul
atory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting fromcatastrophic events, ch
anges in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in amemorandum account and th
e CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudentlyincurred. These accounts, which 
include the CEMA, WEMA, and FHPMA, among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related todisaster and wildfire r
esponse, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUCauthorization in separ
ate proceedings or through a GRC. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account,” “RegulatoryMatters - Catastrophic Exp
ense Memorandum Account,” and “Regulatory Matters - Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)112

Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanism for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-relatedcosts found to be just and reasonab
le by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. The Utility has madean assessment as of Decembe
r 31, 2019 and has concluded that the net wildfire-related claims incurred for the 2017 Northern California wildfires do not meet thecriteria for recognition as a re
gulatory asset. The Utility must evaluate the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period. If the criteria are met at a later date,the Utility would recognize 
a regulatory asset and a related gain in the consolidated income statement in the period in which it is determined that the likelihood ofrecovery is probable.
In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemakingpurposes and if a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regardingprobability of recovery, 
as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expectedto exceed the amount to be 
recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included inthird-party contracts, hist
orical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors. Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ac
count for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valueand its settlement da
te can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived ass
et. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recoveredthrough the ratemaking pro
cess. (See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)To estimate its liab
ility, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and the e
stimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the riskassociated with the decom
missioning obligation.At December 31, 2019, the Utility’s 
recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $6 billion. Changes in theseestimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefi
t PlansPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non
-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement healthcare and medical plans for eli
gible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees andretirees. Adjustments to 
the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amountsare deferred in ac
cumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expenserecognized in accordan
ce with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable ofrecovery from custome
rs. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. (See Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)The pension and 
other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarialassumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health carecost trend rate and the 
expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes oramendments, or significant
 changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future planexpenses. (See Note 12 of the Notes to th
e Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)In establishing health c
are cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluationsuggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the designof PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed h
ealth care cost trend rate for 2019 is 6.3%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% in 2027 and beyond.113

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit 
trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Fixed-income returns were projected based on real maturity and creditspreads added to a long-ter
m inflation rate. Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rateof inflation. For the Utili
ty’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 5.7% compares to a ten-year actual return of 9.3%%.The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 936 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 2019. This yield cu
rve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pensionand other postretirem
ent benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.The following reflects th

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PR
ESENTATIONOrganization and Basis of Presentation
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia. The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility is primarily regulated by theCPUC and the FERC. In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, cons
truction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utilityand its wholly owned and controlled subsid
iaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on aconsolidated basis (i.e., th
e companies operate in one segment).The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form10-K. The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,liabilities, revenu
es and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to theUtility’s wildfire-related liabilities
, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabilities, insurance receivables, regulatory assets and liabilities,AROs, pension and other postretiremen
t benefit plans obligations, and the valuation of LSTC. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected inthe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment thatwould have a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period inwhich such change occurred.
Chapter 11 Filing and Going Concern
The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, therealization of asse
ts and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as a result of the challenges that are further described below, suchrealization of asse
ts and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. PG&E Corporation and the Utility suffered material losses as a result of the 2017Northern California wildfi
res and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to the decision to file for Chapter 11 protection.  See Note 14 below. Uncertaintyregarding these matt
ers raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s abilities to continue as going concerns.  PG&E Corporation and theUtility have determin
ed that commencing reorganization cases under Chapter 11 was necessary to restore PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial stabilityto fund ongoing operations and provide s
afe service to customers. However, there can be no assurance that such proceedings will restore PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s financi
al stability.  On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the BankruptcyCourt.  The Consolidated Financial Sta
tements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should PG&E Corporation and the Utility be unable tocontinue as going concerns. 
Pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility retain control of their assets and are authorized to operate theirbusiness as debtors-in-possession whil
e being subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. While operating as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11,PG&E Corporation and the Utility may s
ell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or asotherwise permitted in 
the ordinary course of business and subject to restrictions in PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's DIP Credit Agreement (see Note 5 below)and applicable orders of 
the Bankruptcy Court, for amounts other than those reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  Any such actionsoccurring during the Chapter 11 Cas
es authorized by the Bankruptcy Court could materially impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reportedin PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's Consolid
ated Financial Statements. (For more information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases, see Note 2 below.)129

NOTE 2: BANKRUPTCY FILINGChapter 11 Proceedings
On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
commenced the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continueto operate their business 
as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of theBankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankrupt
cy Court.Under the Bankruptcy Code, third-par
ty actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness owed by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as well as most litigation pendingagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity (including the third-party matters described in Note 14 below) as of the Petition Date, are subject to an automatic stay.Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court p
roviding otherwise, substantially all pre-petition liabilities will be resolved under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization tobe voted upon by impaired cred
itors and interest holders, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. However, under the Bankruptcy Code, regulatory or criminalproceedings generally a
re not subject to an automatic stay, and these proceedings have been continuing during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.Under the priority scheme 
established by the Bankruptcy Code, certain post-petition and secured or “priority” pre-petition liabilities need to be satisfied beforegeneral unsecured cred
itors and holders of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s equity are entitled to receive any distribution. No assurance can be given as towhat values, if any, will be asc
ribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to the claims and interests of each of these constituencies. Additionally, no assurance can be given asto whether, when or in what form unsecu
red creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s equity may receive a distribution on such claims orinterests.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,including, without limita
tion, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Anydescription of an executo
ry contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunderor a quantification of 
their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights PG&E Corporation and the Utility haveunder the Bankruptcy Code.
Significant Bankruptcy Court Actions
First Day Motions
On January 31, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved, on an 
interim basis, certain motions (the “First Day Motions”) authorizing, but not directing, PG&ECorporation and the Utility to, 
among other things, (a) secure $5.5 billion of debtor-in-possession financing; (b) continue to use PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s cash management 
system; and (c) pay certain pre-petition claims relating to (i) certain safety, reliability, outage, and nuclear facility suppliers; (ii)shippers, warehousemen, and other 
lien claimants; (iii) taxes; (iv) employee wages, salaries, and other compensation and benefits; and (v) customer programs,including public purpose progra
ms. The First Day Motions were subsequently approved by the Bankruptcy Court on a final basis at hearings on February 27, 2019,March 12, 2019, March 13, 2019, and March 27, 2019.
Bar Date
On July 1, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an o
rder approving a deadline of October 21, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) (the “Bar Date”) for filing claimsagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity relating to the period prior to the Petition Date. The Bar Date is subject to certain exceptions, including for claimsarising under section 503(b)
(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, the bar date for which occurred on April 22, 2019. The Bankruptcy Court also approved PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s plan to provide notice of the Bar Date to parties in interest, including potential wildfire-related claimants and other potentialcreditors. On November 11, 2019, the Bankrupt
cy Court entered an order approving a stipulation between PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the TCC toextend the Bar Date for unfi
led, non-governmental fire claimants to December 31, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).130

Other Significant Actions Related to the Chapter 11 CasesOther significant act
ions and developments related to the Chapter 11 Cases, including the Tubbs Lift Stay Decision, the Tubbs Trial and the Estimation Proceedingare described in Note 14 (in
cluding under the headings “Proceeding in San Francisco County Superior Court for Certain Tubbs Fire-Related Claims” and “WildfireClaims Estimation Proceed
ing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California”).On October 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court issued an ord
er directing the principal parties in the Chapter 11 Cases to participate in mediation.Plan of Reorganization, RSAs, Equity Backstop Commitments and Debt Commitment Le
ttersOn September 9, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity filed with the Bankruptcy Court their Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization for the resolution of theoutstanding pre-petition 
claims against and interests in PG&E Corporation and the Utility, which was thereafter amended on September 23, 2019 and November 4,2019. On January 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility, 
certain funds and accounts managed or advised by Abrams Capital Management, LP (“Abrams”),and certain funds and accoun
ts managed or advised by Knighthead Capital Management, LLC (“Knighthead” and, together with Abrams, the “ShareholderProponents”) filed the Debtors
’ and Shareholder Proponents’ Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization dated January 31, 2020 with the Bankruptcy Court (as maybe amended, modified or suppl
emented from time to time, the “Proposed Plan”).On September 22, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with certain holders of insurance subrogation claims(collectively, the 
“Consenting Subrogation Creditors”) which agreement was amended and restated on November 1, 2019 and subsequently amended further duringNovember and December 2019 (as a
mended, the “Subrogation RSA”). The Subrogation RSA provides for an aggregate amount of $11.0 billion (the “AllowedSubrogation Claim Amount”) to be pa
id by PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Proposed Plan in order to settle all insurance subrogation claims (the“Subrogation Claims”) rel
ating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire (the “Subrogation Claims Settlement”), upon the terms andconditions set forth in the Subrog
ation RSA. Under the Subrogation RSA, PG&E Corporation and the Utility also have agreed to reimburse the holders ofSubrogation Claims for profession
al fees of up to $55 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Subrogation RSA. On September 24, 2019, PG&ECorporation and the Utility f
iled a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to enter into, and perform under, the Subrogation RSA and approval of theSubrogation Claims Settlemen
t. Hearings on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve the Subrogation RSA were held on October 23, 2019,December 4, 2019 and December 17, 2019. On Dece
mber 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motionto approve the Subrogation RSA. See “Restructu
ring Support Agreement with Holders of Subrogation Claims” in Note 14 for further information on theSubrogation RSA.
On December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement, which was subsequently amended on December 16,2019 (as amended, the “TCC RSA”), with the TCC, the atto
rneys and other advisors and agents for holders of Fire Victim Claims (as defined below) that aresignatories to the TCC RSA (each a “Consenting Fi
re Claimant Professional”), and the Shareholder Proponents. The TCC RSA provides for, among other things,an aggregate of $13.5 billion 
in value to be provided by PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Proposed Plan in order to settle and discharge all claimsagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity relating to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire (other than theSubrogation Claims and the Public Ent
ity Wildfire Claims) (the “Fire Victim Claims”), upon the terms and conditions set forth in the TCC RSA and the ProposedPlan. On December 9, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to enter into, and perform under, theTCC RSA. A hearing on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s mot
ion to approve the TCC RSA was held on December 17, 2019. On December 19, 2019, theBankruptcy Court entered an orde
r granting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve the TCC RSA. See “Restructuring Support Agreement withthe TCC” in Note 14 for further info
rmation on the TCC RSA.Proposed Plan of Reorganization
The Proposed Plan proposes the following:
•
compensation of wildfire victims and certain public entities from a trust funded for their benefit in an aggregate value of $13.5 billion in accordance withthe terms of the TCC RSA (as further des
cribed under the heading “Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC” in Note 14);131

Equity Backstop CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation has ente
red into Chapter 11 Plan Backstop Commitment Letters (collectively, the “Backstop Commitment Letters”)with investors (collect
ively, the “Backstop Parties”), pursuant to which the Backstop Parties severally agreed to fund up to $12.0 billion of proceeds to finance theProposed Plan through the purchase of PG&E Corpora
tion common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such Backstop Commitment Letters (the“Backstop Commitments”). The p
rice at which any such new shares would be issued to the Backstop Parties would be equal to (a) 10 (subject to adjustment asprovided in the Backstop Commitm
ent Letters), times (b) PG&E Corporation’s consolidated Normalized Estimated Net Income (as defined in the BackstopCommitment Letters) 
for the estimated year 2021, divided by (c) the number of fully diluted shares of PG&E Corporation that will be outstanding on the effectivedate of the Proposed Plan (the “E
ffective Date”) (assuming that all equity is raised by funding the Backstop Commitments).The Backstop Commitment Lett
ers provide that, under certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be permitted to issue new shares of commonstock of PG&E Corporation for up to $12.0 bill
ion of proceeds to finance the transactions contemplated by the Proposed Plan through one or more equity offeringsthat, under certain c
ircumstances, must include a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”). The structure, terms and conditions of any such equity offering (includinga Rights Offering) are expe
cted to be determined by PG&E Corporation and the Utility at a later time in the Chapter 11 process, subject to the terms and conditionsof the Backstop Commitment Le
tters. This may include terms and conditions that are designed to preserve the ability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility to utilizetheir net operating loss 
carryforwards. There can be no assurance that any such equity offering would be successful. In the event that such equity offerings(together with additiona
l permitted capital sources) do not raise at least $12.0 billion of proceeds in the aggregate or if PG&E Corporation and the Utility do nototherwise consummate such of
ferings, then PG&E Corporation and the Utility may draw on the Backstop Commitments for equity funding to finance thetransactions contempl
ated by the Proposed Plan, subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Backstop Parties of the conditions set forth therein. Although theBackstop Commitment Lette
rs permit PG&E Corporation to draw up to $12.0 billion in equity, the Proposed Plan contemplates an equity raise of only $9.0 billion,which equity will be raised in 
accordance with the terms of the Backstop Commitment Letters.Under the Backstop Commitment Le
tters, PG&E Corporation agrees that if the Backstop Commitments are drawn, and PG&E Corporation does not expect toconduct a third-party t
ransaction based upon or related to the utilization or monetization of any net operating losses or tax deductions resulting from the payment ofpre-petition wildfire-related claims (a
 “Tax Benefits Monetization Transaction”) on the Effective Date, no later than five business days prior to the Effective Date,PG&E Corporation and the Utility must 
form a trust which would provide for periodic distributions of cash to the Backstop Parties in amounts equal to (i) all taxbenefits arising from 
the payment of wildfire-related claims in excess of (ii) the first $1.35 billion of tax benefits, starting with fiscal year 2020. PG&E Corporationintends to explore a Tax Benef
its Monetization Transaction.The Backstop Parties’ funding oblig
ations under the Backstop Commitment Letters are subject to numerous conditions, including, among others, that (a) theBackstop Commitment Lette
rs have been approved by the Bankruptcy Court, (b) the conditions precedent to the Effective Date set forth in the Proposed Plan havebeen satisfied or waived in 
accordance with the Proposed Plan, (c) the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order confirming the Proposed Plan and approving thetransactions contempl
ated thereunder, which shall confirm the Proposed Plan with such amendments, modifications, changes and consents as are approved byholders of a majority of 
the aggregate Backstop Commitments (the “Confirmation Order”), (d) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s weighted average earningrate base for 2021 is no less th
an 95% of $48 billion, and (e) there has been no event, occurrence or other circumstance that would have or would reasonably beexpected to have a mat
erial adverse effect on the business of PG&E Corporation and the Utility or their ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by theBackstop Commitment Lette
rs and the Proposed Plan. The Backstop Parties have consented to move the deadline for Bankruptcy Court approval of the BackstopCommitment Letters to Feb
ruary 28, 2020.135

In addition, the Backstop Parties have certain termination rights under the Backstop Commitment Letters, including, among others, if (a) the Proposed Plan(including as may be amend
ed, modified or otherwise changed) does not include Abrams and Knighthead as plan proponents and is not in a form acceptable toeach of Abrams and Knighthead, (b) 
the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an order approving the Backstop Commitment Letters by February 28, 2020, (c) PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s aggregate liability with respect to pre-petition wildfire-related claims exceeds $25.5 billion, (d) the Proposed Plan is amendedwithout the consent of the holde
rs of a majority of the aggregate Backstop Commitments, (e) the Confirmation Order has not been entered by the Bankruptcy Courtby June 30, 2020, (f) the Effectiv
e Date has not occurred within 60 days of entry of the Confirmation Order, (g) a material adverse effect (as described above)occurs, (h) wildfires occu
r in the Utility’s service area in 2019 that damage or destroy in excess of 500 dwellings or commercial structures in the aggregate, (i) theCPUC fails to issue all necessary app
rovals, authorizations and final orders to implement the Proposed Plan prior to June 30, 2020, including approvals related tothe Utility’s capita
l structure and authorized rate of return and the resolution of the CPUC’s claims against the Utility for fines or penalties, all of which must besatisfactory to the hold
ers of a majority of the aggregate Backstop Commitments, (j) the amount of asserted administrative expense claims or the amount ofadministrative expens
e claims PG&E Corporation and the Utility have reserved for and/or paid in the aggregate exceeds $250 million, in each case excludingadministrative expens
e claims that are ordinary course, professional fee claims, claims that are disallowed in the Chapter 11 Cases and the portion of anadministrative expens
e claim that is covered by insurance, (k) one or more wildfires occur in the Utility’s service area on or after January 1, 2020 that damage ordestroy at least 500 dwellings o
r commercial structures in the aggregate at a time when the portion of the Utility’s system at the location of such wildfire was notsuccessfully de-energi
zed, (l) as of the Effective Date, the Utility has not elected and received Bankruptcy Court approval, or satisfied the other requiredconditions, to participa
te in the statewide wildfire fund established by AB 1054, (m) at any time the Bankruptcy Court determines that PG&E Corporation and theUtility are insolvent, (n
) PG&E Corporation and the Utility enter into any Tax Benefit Monetization Transaction and the net cash proceeds thereof are less than$3.0 billion, excluding the $1.35 bil
lion of tax benefits to be utilized in the Proposed Plan, and (o) the Proposed Plan or any supplements to or other documents inconnection with the Proposed Plan has be
en amended, modified or changed, without the consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate BackstopCommitments, to include a p
rocess for transferring the license and operating assets of the Utility to the State of California or a third party (a “Transfer”) or PG&ECorporation and the Utility e
ffect a Transfer other than pursuant to the Proposed Plan. There can be no assurance that the conditions precedent set forth in theBackstop Commitment Lette
rs will be satisfied or waived, nor that events or circumstances will not occur that give rise to termination rights of the BackstopParties.
The commitment prem
ium for the Backstop Commitments is 6.364% of the amount of the Backstop Commitments. Such commitment premium will be earned infull upon Bankruptcy Court approval of 
the Backstop Commitment Letters, subject to clawback under certain circumstances set forth in the Backstop CommitmentLetters. Subject to lim
ited exceptions, all commitment premiums are payable in shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation to be issued on the Effective Date,and the number of such shares to b
e paid as commitment premiums will be calculated using the backstop price described above. In the event that a plan ofreorganization for PG&E Corpora
tion that is not the Proposed Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, then the backstop commitment premium will be payablein cash if elected by th
e applicable Backstop Party. Under the Backstop Commitment Letters, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also agreed to reimburse theBackstop Parties for reasonab
le professional fees and expenses of up to $17 million in the aggregate for the legal advisor and $19 million in the aggregate for thefinancial advisor, upon the 
terms and conditions set forth in the Backstop Commitment Letters.Debt Commitment Letters
On October 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
entered into debt commitment letters, which were subsequently amended on November 18, 2019,December 20, 2019, January 30, 2020, and February 14, 2020 
(as amended, the “Debt Commitment Letters”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America,N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global M
arkets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and the otherlenders that may become partie
s to the Debt Commitment Letters as additional “Commitment Parties” as provided therein (the foregoing parties, collectively, the“Commitment Parties”
), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties committed to provide $10.825 billion in bridge financing in the form of (a) a $5.825 billionsenior secured bridge loan 
facility (the “OpCo Facility”) with the Utility or any domestic entity formed to hold all of the assets of the Utility upon emergence frombankruptcy (the Utility or 
any such entity, the “OpCo Borrower”) as borrower thereunder and (b) a $5.00 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility (togetherwith the OpCo Facility, the “Facil
ities”) with PG&E Corporation or any domestic entity formed to hold all of the assets of PG&E Corporation upon emergencefrom bankruptcy (the Corpora
tion or any such entity, the “HoldCo Borrower”) as borrower thereunder, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Thecommitments under the Deb
t Commitment Letters will expire on August 29, 2020, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the termination rights described below.136

Borrowings under the OpCo Facility would be senior secured obligations of the OpCo Borrower, secured by substantially all of the assets of the OpCo Borrower.Borrowings under the HoldCo Facility would be senio
r unsecured obligations of the HoldCo Borrower. The OpCo Borrower’s obligations under the OpCo Facility,and the HoldCo Borrower’s obligations under 
the HoldCo Facility, would not be guaranteed by any other entity. The scheduled maturity of each of the Facilitieswould be 364 days following the date the Fa
cilities are funded. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will pay customary fees and expenses in connection withobtaining the Facilities.
In connection with the anti
cipated funding for the Proposed Plan and the anticipated amount of debt and equity to be used for funding thereunder, on February 14,2020, the Debt Commitment Lett
ers were amended to, among other things, (1) adjust the maximum amount of any roll-over, “take-back” or reinstated debtpermitted under the Fac
ilities from $30.0 billion to $33.35 billion at the Utility and from $7.0 billion to $5.0 billion at PG&E Corporation and (2) increase theamount of proceeds from th
e issuance of debt securities or other debt for borrowed money as a condition to funding from $2.0 billion at PG&E Corporation to$6.0 billion at the Utility.
The Commitment Parties’ 
funding obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters are subject to numerous conditions and termination rights, including, amongothers, certain condit
ions and termination rights similar to those included in the Backstop Commitment Letters, in addition to conditions that are not in theBackstop Commitment Lette
rs, including (a) the delivery of specified financial information, (b) PG&E Corporation’s receipt of at least $9.0 billion of proceedsfrom the issuance of equi
ty, (c) the execution of definitive documentation for the Facilities and (d) that the Utility shall have received investment grade seniorsecured debt ratings. In add
ition, the Debt Commitment Letters are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court on or before February 28, 2020, and the Utility’sability to borrow under the OpCo Facil
ity is subject to approval by the CPUC.In lieu of entering into 
the Facilities, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to obtain permanent financing on or prior to emergence from bankruptcy in the formof bank facilities, deb
t securities or a combination of the foregoing.On October 23, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of the Backstop Commitment Letters, theDebt Commitment Letters 
and certain related matters. The hearing on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve the Backstop Commitment Letters,the Debt Commitment Lett
ers and certain related matters is scheduled for February 26, 2020.The timing and outcome of th
e Chapter 11 Cases is uncertain. Although PG&E Corporation, the Utility, the Bankruptcy Court, the CPUC and many otherstakeholders have stated 
that they are working towards confirming a plan of reorganization by June 30, 2020, it is possible that the Chapter 11 process could extendbeyond the June 30, 2020 deadline and tak
e a number of years to resolve.Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan of Reorganization
On October 17, 2019, the TCC and the Ad Hoc Noteholder Committ
ee filed the Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan. On December 19, 2019, pursuant to the TCC RSA(described below), the TCC filed 
a notice of withdrawal as a plan proponent of the Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. The Ad Hoc NoteholderPlan differed from the Propos
ed Plan in a number of respects, including, but not limited to, its treatment of equity interests, its treatment of holders of claims inrespect of debt of PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility and its financing sources.On January 22, 2020, the Ad Hoc Noteholder Committe
e entered into the Noteholder RSA with PG&E Corporation and the Utility, under which it agreed, uponentry of the order of the Bank
ruptcy Court approving the Noteholder RSA, to withdraw any participation in and support for the Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan, includingby taking certain act
ions to defer further action on the make-whole and post-petition interest issues. On February 4, 2020, the Noteholder RSA was approved by theBankruptcy Court, and on February 5, 2020, the Ad Hoc Noteholde
r Committee withdrew the Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan. It is possible that, if the Noteholder RSA isterminated, the Ad H
oc Noteholder Committee could re-file a competing plan with similar or different terms.Debtor-In-Possession Financing
See Note 5 for further discussion o
f the DIP Facilities, which provide up to $5.5 billion in financing.137

Financial Reporting in ReorganizationEffective on the Petit
ion Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility began to apply accounting standards applicable to reorganizations, which are applicable tocompanies under Chapter 11 bankrup
tcy protection. These accounting standards require the financial statements for periods subsequent to the Petition Date todistinguish transactions and 
events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Expenses, realized gains andlosses, and provisions for losses tha
t are directly associated with reorganization proceedings must be reported separately as reorganization items, net in theConsolidated Statements of In
come. In addition, the balance sheet must distinguish pre-petition LSTC of PG&E Corporation and the Utility from pre-petitionliabilities that 
are not subject to compromise, post-petition liabilities, and liabilities of the subsidiaries of PG&E Corporation that are not debtors in the Chapter 11Cases in the Consolidated Balance She
ets. LSTC are pre-petition obligations that are not fully secured and have at least a possibility of not being repaid at the fullclaim amount. Where 
there is uncertainty about whether a secured claim will be paid or impaired pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and theUtility have classifi
ed the entire amount of the claim as LSTC.Furthermore, the real
ization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating as debtors-in-possession, actions to enforce orotherwise effect the p
ayment of certain claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in existence before the Petition Date are stayed while PG&E Corporationand the Utility continue busin
ess operations as debtors-in-possession. These claims are reflected as LSTC in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,2019. Additional claims (which cou
ld be LSTC) may arise after the Petition Date resulting from the rejection of executory contracts, including leases, and from thedetermination by the Bankrup
tcy Court (or agreement by parties-in-interest) of allowed claims for contingencies and other disputed amounts.PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financia
l Statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of PG&E Corporation and the Utility andother subsidiaries of PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility that individually and in aggregate are immaterial. Such other subsidiaries did not file for bankruptcy.The Utility’s Consolidated Financ
ial Statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Utility and other subsidiaries of the Utilitythat individually and in agg
regate are immaterial. Such other subsidiaries did not file for bankruptcy.Liabilities Subject to Compromise
As a result of the commenc
ement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities is subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to a plan ofreorganization. Generally,
 actions to enforce or otherwise effect payment of pre-petition liabilities are stayed. Although payment of pre-petition claims generally isnot permitted, the Bankrupt
cy Court granted PG&E Corporation and the Utility authority to pay certain pre-petition claims in designated categories and subject tocertain terms and cond
itions. This relief generally was designed to preserve the value of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business and assets. As describedabove, among other things, the Bankrup
tcy Court authorized, but did not require, PG&E Corporation and the Utility to pay certain pre-petition claims relating toemployee wages and benefits, 
taxes, and amounts owed to certain vendors.The determination of how li
abilities will ultimately be settled or treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court confirms a Chapter 11 plan of reorganizationand such plan becomes effe
ctive. Accordingly, the ultimate amount of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. GAAP requires pre-petition liabilities thatare subject to comprom
ise to be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for different amounts. Theamounts currently class
ified as LSTC are preliminary and may be subject to future adjustments depending on Bankruptcy Court actions, further developments withrespect to disputed claims
, determinations of the secured status of certain claims, the values of any collateral securing such claims, rejection of executory contracts,continued reconcilia
tion or other events.138

At December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $650 million and $21,526 million in aggregate principal amount of pre-petition indebtedness, respectively. Pre-petitionfinancing debt includes accrued contractual interest of $1 million and $286 m
illion for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, to the Petition Date. Financing debt also includes post-petition interest of $15 million and $638 mi
llion for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, in accordance with the terms of the Noteholder RSA. See Note 5 for details of pre-petition debt reported as LSTC.

2001 bankruptcy disputed claims includes $14 million of interest recorded at the interest rate specified by FERC in accordance with S35.19a of the Commission’s regulations.Interest on Debt Subject to Compromise
On December 30, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court issued 
a memorandum decision in which it ruled that the UCC is entitled to post-petition interest at the FederalJudgment Rate of 2.59%. Pursuant to the Not
eholder RSA, holders of $11.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of Utility Short-Term Senior Notes, Utility Long-Term Senior Notes and Utility Funded Debt wi
ll receive interest at the contractual rate for accrued and unpaid pre-petition interest plus interest at the FederalJudgement Rate on the sum of the 
applicable principal plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest for the period commencing the day after the Petition Dateand ending on the Effective Da
te. The $9.58 billion in aggregate principal of Utility Reinstated Senior notes will accrue interest at the contractual rate inaccordance with the te
rms of the Noteholder RSA. From the Petition Date through December 31, 2019, the Utility concluded that interest was probable of being anallowed claim and resum
ed recording interest on pre-petition debt subject to compromise in accordance with the Noteholder RSA. For more information onInterest on Debt Subject to Compro
mise, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Potential Claims
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
received a substantial number of proofs of claim since the Petition Date and are early in the process of reconciling thoseclaims to the amounts l
isted in the schedules of assets and liabilities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may ask the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that theybelieve are duplica
tive, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated, were filed late, or should be disallowed for other reasons.Differences between li
ability amounts recorded by PG&E Corporation and the Utility as liabilities subject to compromise and claims filed by creditors will beinvestigated and, if nec
essary, the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowed amount of the claim. Differences between those final allowedclaims and the liabi
lities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be recognized as reorganization items in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Statementof Consolidated Income (Loss) as 
they are resolved. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be resolved cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Courtapproves a plan of reorgani
zation or approves orders related to settlement of specific liabilities. Accordingly, the ultimate amount or resolution of such liabilities isnot determinable at 
this time. The resolution of such claims could result in substantial adjustments to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial statements.139

ection of Power Purchase AgreementsOn June 7, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court granted PG&E Corporat
ion’s and the Utility’s motion for declaratory judgment in an adversary proceeding entitled PacificGas and Electric Company v. FERC.  In its amend
ed declaratory judgment, the Bankruptcy Court found that FERC had no “concurrent jurisdiction, or anyjurisdiction, over the de
termination of whether any rejections of power purchase contracts by either Debtor should be authorized” pursuant to section 365 of theBankruptcy Code.  The Bankruptcy Court also found th
at the “Debtors do not need approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject any of theirpower purchase contracts” 
and that “[a]ny determinations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission” that were contrary to these findings “are void, of noforce and effect and no
t binding on this court or either Debtor.”  The Bankruptcy Court further stated that such determinations include, but are not limited to, thosepreviously made in cert
ain FERC proceedings initiated before the Chapter 11 Cases were filed in connection with power purchase contracts with the Utility (the“FERC Orders”).
On June 12, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court certif
ied its amended declaratory judgment for direct appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 15, 2019, FERC and certain counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements filed requests for the Ninth Circuit to permit such direct appeal,which the Ninth Circuit granted on Sep
tember 17, 2019. On September 17, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted the requests and docketed both appeals. Opening briefsof FERC and the other appellants were 
filed on November 20, 2019, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s answering brief was filed on December 20, 2019, andreply briefs of FERC and the other app
ellants were filed on January 17, 2020. Separately, on June 26, 2019, the Utility filed a petition for review of the FERCOrders, also in the Ninth Circuit. On Sept
ember 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted the Utility’s motion to align the briefing schedule with the direct appeals fromthe Bankruptcy Court. The Utility’s op
ening brief was filed on November 20, 2019, FERC’s and respondent-intervenors’ answering briefs were filed on December20, 2019, and the Utility’s reply br
ief was filed on January 17, 2020.The Proposed Plan proposes to assume all powe
r purchase agreements and community choice aggregation servicing agreements.140

Resolution of Remaining 2001 Chapter 11 Disputed ClaimsVarious electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s 2001 prior proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energysupplied to the Utility’s cus
tomers between May 2000 and June 2001.  While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility pursued settlements withelectricity suppli
ers and entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolvethe Utility’s refund cl
aims against these electricity suppliers. Under these settlement agreements, amounts payable by the parties, in some instances, would besubject to adjustment bas
ed on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FERC. Generally, any net refunds, claimoffsets, or other credi
ts that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicialproceedings are refunded 
to customers through rates in future periods.The Utility’s obligations with 
respect to such claims (all of which arose prior to the initiation of the Utility’s pending Chapter 11 Case on January 29, 2019),including pursuant to any prior s
ettlements relating thereto, will not be resolved until after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUN
TING POLICIESLoss Contingencies
A provision for a loss contingency is 
recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably beestimated. PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record acharge that refle
cts their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludesanticipated legal 
costs, which are expensed as incurred.Regulation and Regulated Operations
The Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenuerequirements through ra
tes is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assetsand liabilities tha
t result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes andrecords, as regulatory ass
ets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatoryassets are amortiz
ed over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered throughrates, the Utility re
cords those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future arealso recorded as regula
tory liabilities.The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of recovery or r
efund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customerbillings or authorized r
evenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have noimpact on net income.  See 
“Revenue Recognition” below.Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To theextent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.141

Revenue RecognitionRevenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes r
evenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Ratescharged to customers ar
e based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because ofseasonality, weather, and cus
tomer usage patterns.Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.  The Utility'sability to recover r
evenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in these rate cases is independent or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility's sales ofelectricity and natural gas ser
vices. The Utility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable ofrecovery, and are expec
ted to be collected within 24 months.  Generally, electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year. The Utilityrecords a balancing accou
nt asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery orrefund.
The CPUC also has authorized the Utility 
to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, therevenue recognition cr
iteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing accountasset or liability fo
r differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differencesare probable of recove
ry or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.142

These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated atfair value. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable
PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizablevalue.  The allowance is det
ermined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables, current economic conditions,and assessment of customer 
collectability.Inventories
Inventories are car
ried at weighted-average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground isrecorded to inventory when inj
ected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materialsand supplies are recorded 
to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.Emission Allowances
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.143

Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor andmaterials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, andequipment were as follows:

Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted-average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energyoutput.  (See Note 15 below.)
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment balance 
in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,plant, and equipment.  The Util
ity’s composite depreciation rates were 3.80% in 2019, 3.82% in 2018, and 3.83% in 2017.  The useful lives of the Utility’sproperty, plant, and equipmen
t are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers. Depreciation expense inc
ludes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value atretirement.  Upon reti
rement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs andmaintenance, including pla
nned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs o
f debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and iscapitalized as par
t of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placedin service.  AFUDC related to the cost o
f debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  TheUtility recorded AFUDC related to deb
t and equity, respectively, of $55 million and $79 million during 2019, $53 million and $129 million during 2018, and $38million and $89 million dur
ing 2017.Asset Retirement Obligations
The following table summar
izes the changes in ARO liability during 2019 and 2018, including nuclear decommissioning obligations:(in millions)
2019 2018 ARO liability at beginning of year
$ 5,994  $4,899  Revision in estimated cash 
flows(376)  993  Accretion
274  211  Liabilities settled
(38)  (109)  ARO liability at end of year
$ 5,854  $5,994  144

The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement dateor range of potential se
ttlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirementactivities associated with 
substations, certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment fromleased property; and res
toration of land to the conditions under certain agreements. Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding conducted by the CPUC.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristicsfor the Utility's nuclea
r power plants.  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such asdecommissioning dates; r
egulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements fordecommissioning costs from 
customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.The total nuclear deco
mmissioning obligation accrued was $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The estimated undiscountednuclear decommissioning 
cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $10.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018.Disallowance of Plant Costs
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 15below.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts
The Utility’s nuclear gen
eration facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires thesafe removal of a nuclear ge
neration facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license andrelease of the proper
ty for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts untilauthorized for rele
ase by the CPUC. The Utility classifies 
its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assetsare managed by externa
l investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses areconsidered other-than-temporar
y impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, fromcustomers through rates.  The
refore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact onthe Utility’s earnings or 
accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiaryand is required to consolida
te the VIE.  Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that wouldgenerate electr
icity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2019, it assessedwhether it absorbs any of the VIE’s 
expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchaseagreement, analyzed 
the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are mostsignificant to the VIE’s pe
rformance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amountthe Utility pays for deliv
ered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are mostsignificant to the econo
mic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2019, it didnot consolidate any of them.

Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsRecognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) , which amended the guidance r elated to the definition of a lease, the recognition of leaseassets and liabiliti
es, and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new standard, a lease exists when an arrangement allows thelessee to control the use o
f an identified asset for a stated period in exchange for payments. This determination is made at inception of the arrangement. All leasesmust be recognized as a ROU asset and 
a lease liability on the balance sheet of the lessee. The ROU asset reflects the lessee’s right to use the underlying asset forthe lease term and th
e lease liability reflects the obligation to make the lease payments. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted the ASU for leases on January1, 2019.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility el
ected certain practical expedients and will carry forward historical conclusions related to (1) contracts that contain leases, (2)existing lease and ease
ment classification, and (3) initial direct costs. After adoption of the new standard, PG&E Corporation and Utility elected not to separatelease and non-lease compon
ents. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will not restate comparative reporting periods.The Utility estimates 
the ROU assets and lease liabilities at net present value using its incremental secured borrowing rates, unless the implicit discount rate in theleasing arrangement can be a
scertained. The incremental secured borrowing rate is based on observed market data and other information available at the leasecommencement date. Th
e ROU assets and lease liabilities only include the fixed lease payments for arrangements with terms greater than 12 months. Renewal andtermination options only i
mpact the lease term if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. PG&E Corporation recognizes lease expense on a straight-linebasis over the lease te
rm. The Utility recognizes lease expense in conformity with ratemaking.Operating leases are in
cluded in operating lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financingleases are included in p
roperty, plant, and equipment, other current liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing leaseswere immaterial 
for the year ended December 31, 2019.On January 1, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities of $2.8 billion, representing the net present value of only the fixedlease payments. This amount 
is presented within the supplemental disclosures of noncash activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Utility made totalcash payments, including fix
ed and variable, of $2.4 billion for operating leases which are presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement ofCash Flows. The fixed cash payments for th
e principal portion of the financing lease liabilities are immaterial and continue to be included within financingactivities on the Consolida
ted Statement of Cash Flows. Any variable lease payments for financing leases are included in operating activities on the ConsolidatedStatement of Cash Flows.
The majority of the Util
ity’s ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to various power purchase agreements. These power purchase agreements primarily consist ofgeneration plants leas
ed to meet customer demand plus applicable reserve margins. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded ROU assets and leaseliabilities related to property a
nd land arrangements.At December 31, 2019, the Utility’s 
leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.9 years and a weighted average discount rate of 6.2%.The following table shows the leas

Debtor-In-Possession Facilities
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, among the Utility, as borrower, PG&ECorporation, as guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ad
ministrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the lenders and issuing banks party thereto(together with such other f
inancial institutions from time to time party thereto, the “DIP Lenders”). The DIP Credit Agreement provides for $5.5 billion in seniorsecured superpriority deb
tor in possession credit facilities in the form of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion (the “DIP RevolvingFacility”), including a $1.5 b
illion letter of credit subfacility, (ii) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “DIP Initial Term LoanFacility”) and (iii
) a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility,” together withthe DIP Revolving Facility and the DIP Ini
tial Term Loan Facility, the “DIP Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The DIP CreditAgreement also provides for up 
to $4.0 billion of incremental facilities in the form of (i) one or more additional tranches of term loans or (ii) one or more increasesin the aggregate amount o
f revolving commitments under the DIP Revolving Facility (together, the “Incremental Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditionsset forth therein. The In
cremental Facilities are uncommitted and would require approval from the Bankruptcy Court.On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed a motion seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the DIP Facilities, which motionwas granted on an interim bas
is by the Bankruptcy Court following a hearing on January 31, 2019. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of theDIP Facilities and the satis
faction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019 and a portion of the DIPRevolving Facility in the amoun
t of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to the Utility. On March 27, 2019,the Bankruptcy Court approved the DIP Faci
lities on a final basis, authorizing the Utility to borrow up to the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (includingthe remainder of the $1.5 b
illion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, in each case subjectto the terms and conditions o
f the DIP Credit Agreement.Borrowings under the DIP Facilities a
re senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Facilities are guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, andsuch guarantee is a senior s
ecured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case.151

The proceeds of the borrowings under the DIP Facilities can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to pay fees, costs and expensesincurred in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement and professional and other fees and costs of administration incurred inconnection with the Chapter 11 Cases. On Febru
ary 1, 2019, the Utility borrowed $350 million under the DIP Revolving Facility. On April 3, 2019, following theBankruptcy Court’s final approva
l of the DIP Facilities, the Utility borrowed $1.5 billion under the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and repaid the $350 millionoutstanding under the DIP Revolving Facil
ity. On January 29, 2020, the Utility borrowed $500 million under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility.The DIP Facilities mature on De
cember 31, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”), subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain termsand conditions are satisf
ied, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the then-outstanding loans and available commitments. As of December31, 2019, the Utility does not intend to 
extend the Maturity Date. Both the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan bear interest at aspread of 225 basis points over LIBOR. Borrowings under th
e DIP Revolving Facilities will bear interest based, at the Utility’s election, on (1) LIBOR plus anapplicable margin of 2.25
% or (2) ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. ABR will equal the highest of the following: (i) the administrative agent’s announcedbase rate, (ii) 0.50% abov
e the (x) federal funds effective rate or (y) the overnight federal funds rate, whichever is higher, (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, and(iv) zero.
The Utility is also requir
ed to pay unused fees of 0.375% per annum in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments under the DIP Revolving Facility. TheUtility must also pay (x) a 
fee equal to the applicable margin with respect to LIBOR loans under the DIP Revolving Facility on the aggregate drawable amount ofall outstanding lette
rs of credit under the DIP Revolving Facility and (y) a fronting fee to the relevant issuing DIP Lender equal to 0.125% per annum of theaggregate drawable amoun
t of outstanding letters of credit issued by such issuing DIP Lender.The DIP Credit Agreement includes usu
al and customary covenants for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage inmergers, consolidations, sa
les of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, ineach case subject to cus
tomary exceptions for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type.The DIP Credit Agreement also inc
ludes customary and usual representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including an obligation to deliver 13-weekcash flow forecasts and repo
rts showing variances from such forecasts, in each case on a rolling 4-week basis. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligationsunder the DIP Credit Agreement m
ay be accelerated following certain events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties,covenant defaults, cross-d
efaults to post-petition or unstayed indebtedness of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and their subsidiaries in excess of $200 million,certain events under ERISA, unstayed 
judgments in respect of post-petition obligations involving an aggregate liability in excess of $200 million, change ofcontrol, specified gover
nmental actions having a material adverse effect or condemnation or damage to a material portion of the collateral. Certain bankruptcy-related events are 
also events of default, including, but not limited to, the dismissal by the Bankruptcy Court of any of the Chapter 11 Cases, the conversion of anyof the Chapter 11 Cases to a case und
er Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the appointment of a trustee pursuant to Chapter 11, any order authorizing the DIPFacilities being stayed, v
acated, reversed or amended in a manner adverse to the DIP Lenders, and certain other events related to the impairment of the DIPLenders’ rights or liens gr
anted under the DIP Credit Agreement.The commencement of th
e Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event with respect to, and caused an automatic and immediateacceleration of th
e debt outstanding under or in respect of, certain instruments and agreements relating to direct financial obligations of PG&E Corporation and theUtility (the “Accele
rated Direct Financial Obligations”). However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date,and are subject to the app
licable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligationsinclude the Utility's outst
anding senior notes, agreements in respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as wellas short-term borrowings under PG&E Corpor
ation's and the Utility's revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility.152

tion interest of $15 million and $638 million for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, in accordance with the terms of theNoteholder RSA. As of December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility wrote off $178 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount 
to present the debt subject tocompromise at the outstanding face value. The write-offs are included within long-term regulatory assets in the Conso
lidated Balance Sheets. See Notes 2 and 4 for further details.(3)

ter of credit facilities supporting the Series 1996 C, E, F,1997 B bonds were extended to December 1, 2020. Although the stated maturity date of these bonds is 2026, each series will remain ou
tstanding only if the Utility extends or replaces theletter of credit related to the series or otherwise obtains consent from the issuer to the continuat
ion of the series without a credit facility.(7)

The California Pollution Control Fin
ancing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rateand multi-modal tax-
exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used tofinance or refinanc
e pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyonnuclear power plant.  In 1999, the Ut
ility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geysers PowerCompany, LLC pursuant to purchase and sales 
agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollutioncontrol faciliti
es for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control bonds issued to finance the Geysers project are outstanding.  Except for components that may havebeen abandoned in place or dispos
ed of as scrap or that are permanently non-operational, the Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC intendsto cease using the b
ond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities.Revolving Credit Facilities Subjec
t to CompromisePG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revo
lving credit facilities have been subject to an automatic and immediate acceleration as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.Prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, proce
eds from the revolving credit facilities were used for working capital, the repayment of commercial paper, and other corporatepurposes.

ck outstanding at December 31, 2019.  PG&E Corporation held all of the Utility’s outstanding commonstock at December 31, 2019.
There were no issuances under th
e PG&E Corporation February 2017 equity distribution agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019. The remaining grosssales available under

tock fund on the open market rather than directly from PG&E Corporation.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,due to the uncertainty relate
d to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with wildfires. See Wildfire-related contingencies in Note 14 below.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid.  Under thei
r respective pre-petition credit agreements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility were each required to maintain a ratio ofconsolidated total debt 
to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%. As of the Petition Date, these obligations were automatically stayed and are subject to theapplicable provisions of th
e Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.  The DIP Facilities have no such restriction.  Additionally, the Utility’s netassets, and therefore i
ts ability to pay dividends, are restricted by the CPUC-authorized capital structure, which requires the Utility to maintain, on average, at least52% equity.  Due to the net charg
es recorded in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires as of December 31, 2018, theUtility submitted to the CPUC an appli
cation for a waiver of the capital structure condition on February 28, 2019. The waiver is subject to CPUC approval. TheUtility is not considered to b
e in violation of these conditions during the period the waiver application is pending resolution. Beginning in 2020, the Utility expectsto resume payment of pre
ferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock, subject to the Utility’s Board of Directors’ approval. PG&E Corporation does not expectto pay any cash for common stock d
ividends for at least the next two years, subject to PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors’ approval.156

Long-Term Incentive PlanThe PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various 
forms of share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and othershare-based awards, to elig
ible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receivecertain share-based 
awards.  A maximum of 17 million shares of PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuanceunder the 2014 LTIP, of which 12,338,419 shares were av
ailable for future awards at December 31, 2019.The following table provides a su

Stock Options
The exercise price of s
tock options granted under the 2014 LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’scommon stock on the date of gr
ant.  Stock options generally have a 10-year term and vest over three years of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting incertain circumst
ances. As of December 31, 2019, $10.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options were expected to berecognized over a weighted 
average period of 1.73 years for PG&E Corporation.The fair value of each s
tock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method.  The weighted average grant date fair value ofoptions granted using the Black-Scho
les valuation method in 2019 and 2018 was $3.87 and $10.24 per share, respectively.  The significant assumptions used forshares granted in 2019 were:

ptions is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.There was no tax benefit re
cognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2019.157

ments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generallyrecognized ratably ove
r the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2019,2018, and 2017 was $18.57, $40.92, and $66.95, respectively.  The to
tal fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $42million, $41 million, and $57 m

ecorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2019, $19million of total unre
cognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted averageperiod of 1.14 years.

PG&E Corporation has authorized 80 mi
llion shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock, which may be issued asredeemable or nonrede
emable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding.The Utility has authorized 75 
million shares of $25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock.  At December 31, 2019 andDecember 31, 2018, the Utility’s p
referred stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with interest rates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemablepreferred stock and $113 mi
llion of shares with interest rates between 4.36% and 5% that are redeemable between $25.75 and $27.25 per share.  The Utility’spreferred stock outstand
ing are not subject to mandatory redemption.  All outstanding preferred stock has a $25 par value.At December 31, 2019, annual dividends on th
e Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferredstock is subject to redemp
tion at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividendsthrough the redemption dat
e.  At December 31, 2019, annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share.Dividends on all Utility pref
erred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights. Upon liquidation or dissolution of th
e Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaiddividends, as specified for 
the class and series.  The Utility paid no dividends on preferred stock in 2019, 2018, and $14 million of dividends on preferred stock in2017 (See “Dividends” in Note 6, above).
NOTE 8: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calcula
ted by dividing the income (loss) available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common sharesoutstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies th
e treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation ofdiluted EPS.  The following is a reconc

NOTE 9: INCOME TAXESPG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferredincome taxes resulting 
from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferredtax assets and liabilities.
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciationexpense.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will besustained upon examination by t
axing authorities based on the merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based onthe largest amount of ben
efit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken or expected tobe taken in a tax return 
in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognizedtax benefit. 
Investment tax credits are deferre
d and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period.  The
 Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under whichthe Utility determin
es its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis. The significant components o

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits are not likely to change significantly within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2019, it isreasonably possible that unr
ecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $10 million within the next 12 months. Interest income, int
erest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Forthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 
and 2017, these amounts were immaterial.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enac
ted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reducesthe federal income 
tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities. The Treasury is still issuing interpretiveguidance on various aspects of 
the Tax Act. If future guidance requires a change in the recorded tax amounts, any necessary change will be reflected in the periodsuch guidance is issued.
Tax settlements
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have b
een accepted through 2015 for federal income tax purposes, except for a few matters, the most significant of which relate todeductible repair cos

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation does notbelieve that the Chapte
r 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards. PG&E Corporation will continue to monitor thestatus of tax carryforwa
rds during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.NOTE 10: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is expo
sed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered throughcustomer rates. The Utilit
y uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.Derivatives include cont
racts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter. By order dated April 8, 2019, th
e Bankruptcy Court authorized the Utility to continue these programs in the ordinary course of business in a mannerconsistent with its pre-pe
tition practices.Derivatives are presen
ted in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements foreach counter-party. The 
fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offsetexist.
Price risk management activities
 that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments are notheld for speculative purpos
es and are subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Utility expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives underthe applicable ratemaking mechani
sm in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.Therefore, all unrea
lized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatoryassets and liabiliti
es on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost ofnatural gas with corresponding 
increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.The Utility elects the n
ormal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives. Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These items 
are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Volume of Derivative Activity

ity’s derivatives instruments, including power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit ratingfrom each of the majo
r credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. During the first quarter of 2019, multiple credit rating agenciesdowngraded the Utility’s cred
it ratings below investment grade, which resulted in the Utility posting additional collateral. As of December 31, 2019, the Utilitysatisfied or has other
wise addressed its obligations related to the credit-risk related contingency features.NOTE 11: FAIR VALUE 
MEASUREMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair valuehierarchy is establish
ed that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:•
Level 1 – Observable inputs  that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•
Level 2 – Other inputs that are  directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are support ed by little or no market activities.The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.164

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are heldby PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions onthe terms and conditions upon which 
the investments may be redeemed. There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31,2019 and 2018.
Trust Assets
Assets Measured at Fair Value
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. Nuclear decommissioning trust assetsand other trust assets ar
e composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are money market funds valued atLevel 1.
Global equity securities p
rimarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.166

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified asLevel 2 using evaluated pri
cing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Exped
ientInvestments in the nucle
ar decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedienthave not been classified 
in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amountspresented in the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchangesas well as fixed-income s
ecurities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, andCRRs that are traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter. Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable marketforward prices for the unde
rlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or arevalued using forward prices f
rom broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued usingobservable market data and
 market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3. These Level 3 contracts are valued usingeither estimated b
asis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond aperiod for which market da
ta is available.  Market and credit risk management utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3instruments using pricing inpu
ts from brokers and historical data.The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.Level 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis
Inputs used and the fair valu
e of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related toLevel 3 instruments are e
xpected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value ofthese instruments.  See Note 10 abov

-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cashbalance plan for those e
ligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying theseplans are qualified t
rusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deductpayments made to the qual
ified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts,consistent with applicabl
e regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plans up to theamount it is authorized 
to recover in rates, $328 million for both 2019 and 2018.169

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributorypostretirement life insurance pla
ns for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to maintain existing pension and other benefit plans duringthe pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits otherthan pension as components of ac
cumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income and Consol
idated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accountingpurposes and expense or income fo
r ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.  For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability isrecorded for amounts tha
t would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utilitygenerally records a r
egulatory liability for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  As the Utility is unable torecord a regulatory ass
et for these other benefits, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).The estimated amounts th

The assumed health care cost trend rate as of December 31, 2019 was 6.3%, decreasing gradually to an ultimate trend rate in 2027 and beyond of approximately4.5%.  A one-percentage-point

rn on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target assetallocations of the emp
loyee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments wereprojected based on real 
maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates ofdividend yield and real e
arnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 5.7% compares to a ten-year actual returnof 9.3%.  The rate used to discount p
ension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 936 Aa-gradenon-callable bonds at Dece
mber 31, 2019.  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flowsfor the pension benefits and o
ther benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.Investment Policies and Strategies
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefitobligations.  Volatility in 
funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financialreporting, as well as the a
mount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of fundedstatus volatility. 
The trusts’ asset alloc
ations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes alsoinfluence liabili
ty valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significantallocations in long matu
rity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-termfunding costs due to their highe
r expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-incomeinvestments by exhibiting r
eturns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include commodities futures, global REITS, global listedinfrastructure equi
ties, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios. Derivative instruments su
ch as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasuryfutures, are also used to r
ebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion ofthe non U.S. dollar exposure of global equ
ity investments.The target asset allocation 
percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk
 management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountabilityand documentation.  Trust inves
tment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage riskthrough appropriate use of physi
cal direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.Fair Value Measurements

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that arevalued using a net asset valu
e per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments 
consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.
Global Equity securities
The global equity category 
includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on publicexchanges and are there
fore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identicalsecurities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.174

Real AssetsThe real asset catego
ry includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodityfutures, global REITS, and global lis
ted infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets. Fixed-Income securities
Fixed-income securiti
es are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the trusts 
that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tablesabove. The fair value amoun

Employer Contributions
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
ributed $328 million to the pension benefit plans and $29 million to the other benefit plans in 2019.  These contributions areconsistent with PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicableregulatory decisions and f
ederal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirementrequiring a cash contribu
tion in 2019.  The Utility’s pension benefits met all the funding requirements under Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp
ect to make total contributions of approximately $327 million and $15 million to the pension plan and other postretirement benefitplans, respectively, for 2020. 
Benefits Payments and Receipts
As of December 31, 2019, the estima

Retirement Savings Plan
PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirem
ent savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code 1986, asamended.  This plan permits 
eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provide for employer contributions to be made toeligible particip
ants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were$109 million, $105 million, and $103 m
illion in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporation changed its default matchingcontributions under its 401(k) p
lan from PG&E Corporation common stock to cash. Beginning in March 2019, at PG&E Corporation’s directive, the 401(k) plantrustee began purchasing new sha
res in the PG&E Corporation common stock fund on the open market rather than directly from PG&E Corporation.There were no materia
l differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.176

NOTE 13: RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONSThe Utility and other subsidia
ries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility andPG&E Corporation exchange administ
rative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility arepriced at the higher of 
fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of theservices.  Services provided d
irectly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending onthe nature and value of th
e services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries usingagreed-upon allocation 
factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies. Management believes that the
 methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.The Utility’s significan

-RELATED CONTINGENCIESPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a losscontingency is recorded when i
t is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluate 
which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their bestestimate or the lower 
end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or arange of losses is estimab
le, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates areadjusted to reflect 
the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs,which are expensed as incurr
ed. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materiallyaffected by the outcom
e of the following matters.Pre-petition Wildfire-Re
lated ClaimsPre-petition wildfire
-related claims on the Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires, and the 2015 Butte fi
re.177

At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include estimated liabilities in respect of total wildfire-related claims of$25.5 billion and $14.2 billion, respe
ctively. The aggregate liability of $25.5 billion for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires, and 
the 2015 Butte fire is comprised of (i) $11 billion for subrogated insurance claimholders pursuant to the Subrogation RSA, plus (ii) $47.5million for expected p
rofessional fees for professionals retained by subrogated insurance claimholders to be reimbursed pursuant to the Subrogation RSA, plus (iii)$1 billion for the Supporting Public En
tities with respect to their Public Entity Wildfire Claims pursuant to the PSAs, plus (iv) $13.5 billion for all other wildfire-related claims, in
cluding individual wildfire claimholders (including those with uninsured and underinsured property losses) and clean-up and fire suppressioncosts, pursuant to the TCC RSA. The aggregate li
ability of $25.5 billion for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfiresand the 2015 Butte fire corr
esponds PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s best estimate of probable losses and is subject to change based on additionalinformation, including th
e other factors discussed below. (See “2018 Camp Fire, 2017 Northern California Wildfires and 2015 Butte Fire Accounting Charge”below.)
On the Petition Date, all wildf
ire-related claims were classified as LSTC and all pending litigation was stayed.In addition, during the year 
ended December 31, 2019, the Utility incurred legal and other costs of $152 million related to the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and 
the 2015 Butte fire with $245 million corresponding costs in the same period in 2018.2018 Camp Fire Background
According to Cal Fire, on November 8, 2018 at 
approximately 6:33 a.m., a wildfire began near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Campfire”), which is locat
ed in the Utility’s service territory. Cal Fire’s Camp Fire Incident Information Website as of November 15, 2019 (the “Cal Fire website”)indicated that the 2018 Camp 
fire consumed 153,336 acres. On the Cal Fire website, Cal Fire reported 85 fatalities and the destruction of 18,804 structuresresulting from the 2018 Camp f
ire. There have been no subsequent updates of this information on the Cal Fire website.On May 15, 2019, Cal Fire issued a news release 
announcing the results of its investigation into the cause of the 2018 Camp fire. According to the news release:•
Cal Fire determined that the 2018 Camp fire was caused by electrical transmission lines owned and operated by the Utility near Pulga, California.•
Cal Fire identified a second ignition site and stated that the second fire was consumed by the original fire which started earlier near Pulga, California. CalFire stated that the c
ause of the second fire was determined to be “vegetation into electrical distribution lines owned and operated by” the Utility.Cal Fire indicated in its n
ews release that its investigation report for the 2018 Camp fire has been forwarded to the Butte County District Attorney. The CaliforniaAttorney General’s Office 
is also investigating the 2018 Camp fire. (See “District Attorneys’ Offices’ Investigations” below for further information regarding theinvestigations of the 2018 Camp f
ire.) As of the date of this filing, Cal Fire’s investigation report has not been shared with PG&E Corporation or the Utility.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ac
cept Cal Fire’s determination that the 2018 Camp fire ignited at the first ignition site. PG&E Corporation and the Utility havenot been able to form a con
clusion as to whether a second fire ignited as a result of vegetation contact with the Utility’s facilities.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e continuing to review the evidence concerning the 2018 Camp fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not yet hadaccess to all of the ev
idence collected by Cal Fire as part of its investigation or to the investigation report prepared by Cal Fire.Further, the CPUC’s SED also conducted investigat
ions into whether the Utility committed civil violations in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. On November26, 2019, the SED concluded its investigat
ion into the 2018 Camp fire and released a report alleging certain violations of state law and CPUC regulations. See“Order Instituting an Inves
tigation into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire” in Note 15 for a description of these proceedings,including the alleged vio
lations in connection with the 2018 Camp fire.178

2017 Northern California Wildfires BackgroundBeginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wild
fires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada, andYuba Counties, as well as in the are
a surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”). According to the Cal Fire California Statewide FireSummary dated October 30, 2017, at th
e peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres anddestroyed an estimated 8,900 s
tructures. The 2017 Northern California wildfires resulted in 44 fatalities.Cal Fire has investigated th
e causes of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and made the following determinations:•
the Utility’s equipment was involved in causing 20 wildfires (the La Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood, Sulphur, Cherokee, 37, Blue, Norrbom,Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Nuns, Pocket, Atlas, Cascad
e, Pressley, Point and Youngs fires); and•
the Tubbs fire was caused by a private electrical system adjacent to a residential structure.As described under the heading “Dis
trict Attorneys’ Offices’ Investigations” below, certain of the 2017 Northern California wildfires were the subject of criminalinvestigations, which have been s
ettled or resulted in PG&E Corporation and the Utility being informed by the applicable district attorneys’ office of a decision notto prosecute.
The SED also conducted investigations 
into whether the Utility committed civil violations in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. See “OrderInstituting an Investiga
tion into the 2017 Northern California Wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire” in Note 15 for a description of these proceedings, including thealleged violations in conn
ection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires.Third-Party Claims, Investigations and Other Proceedings Rela
ted to the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California WildfiresIf the Utility’s fac
ilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine ofinverse condemnation appl
ies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without having been foundnegligent. California cou
rts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on thegrounds that losses borne by the person whose p
roperty was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited fromsuch undertaking, and based on the assu
mption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Further, California courts have determinedthat the doctrine of inv
erse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs. The CPUCmay decide not to authori
ze cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inversecondemnation. (See “Loss Recover
ies – Regulatory Recovery” below for further information regarding potential cost recovery related to the wildfires, including inconnection with SB 901.)
On October 25, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility sub
mitted a brief to the Bankruptcy Court challenging the application of inverse condemnation toCalifornia’s investor-owned u
tilities, including the Utility. The Bankruptcy Court heard argument regarding PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion onNovember 19, 2019. On December 3, 2019, the Bankruptcy Cour
t entered an order holding that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applied to California’sinvestor-owned utilities, 
including the Utility, and certifying the decision for direct appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. PG&E Corporationand the Utility have appea
led this decision; however, as of the date of this filing, this appeal was stayed upon request of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.In addition to claims fo
r property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs,medical expenses, persona
l injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have beennegligent.
Further, the Utility could be sub
ject to material fines, penalties, or restitution orders if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency were to bring an enforcementaction, including a cri
minal proceeding, and it were determined that the Utility had failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.179

As of January 28, 2019, before the automatic stay arising as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility were aware ofapproximately 100 compla
ints on behalf of at least 4,200 plaintiffs related to the 2018 Camp fire, nine of which sought to be certified as class actions. The pendingcivil litigation ag
ainst PG&E Corporation and the Utility related to the 2018 Camp fire, which is currently stayed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter11 Cases, included claims under 
multiple theories of liability, including, but not limited to, inverse condemnation, trespass, private nuisance, public nuisance,negligence, negligence per
 se, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, negligent infliction of emotional distress, premises liability, violationsof the Public Utilities Code, vio
lations of the Health & Safety Code, malice and false advertising in violation of the California Business and Professions Code. Theplaintiffs principa
lly asserted that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failureto properly maintain th
e vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire. The plaintiffs sought damages and remedies that includewrongful death, personal injury, p
roperty damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, establishment of a class action medical monitoring fund, punitive damages,attorneys’ fees and othe
r damages.As of January 28, 2019, before the autom
atic stay arising as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility were aware ofapproximately 750 compla
ints on behalf of at least 3,800 plaintiffs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, five of which sought to be certified as classactions. These cases were coo
rdinated in the San Francisco County Superior Court. As of the Petition Date, the coordinated litigation was in the early stages ofdiscovery. A trial with respe
ct to the Atlas fire was scheduled to begin on September 23, 2019. The pending civil litigation against PG&E Corporation and theUtility related to th
e 2017 Northern California wildfires included claims under multiple theories of liability, including, but not limited to, inverse condemnation,trespass, private nuisanc
e and negligence. This litigation, including the trial date with respect to the Atlas fire, currently is stayed as a result of the commencementof the Chapter 11 Cases. The plaint
iffs principally asserted that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain and repair their distribution andtransmission lines and fa
ilure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The plaintiffssought damages and remedies 
that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ feesand other damages.
As described below under the heading 
“Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC,” on December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into aRSA with the TCC, the Consenting Fire Claimant Profession
als and the Shareholder Proponents to potentially resolve all wildfire-related claims relating to the2017 Northern California wildfi
res and the 2018 Camp fire (other than subrogated insurance claims and Public Entity Wildfire Claims) through the Chapter 11process. On December 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Cour
t entered an order granting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve the TCC RSA.Insurance carriers who hav
e made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires filed 52 subrogationcomplaints in the San Francis
co County Superior Court and the Sonoma County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among otherthings, negligence, inverse 
condemnation, trespass and nuisance. The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. As of January 28, 2019,before the automati
c stay arising as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, insurance carriers filed 39 similar subrogation complaints with respect to the 2018Camp fire in the Sacram
ento County Superior Court and the Butte County Superior Court. As described below under the heading “Restructuring SupportAgreement with Holders of Subrogation Cl
aims,” on September 22, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into a RSA with certain holders of insurancesubrogation claims to poten
tially resolve all insurance subrogation claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire through theChapter 11 process. On December 19, 2019, the Bank
ruptcy Court entered an order granting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motion to approve theSubrogation RSA.
Various government entiti
es, including Yuba, Nevada, Lake, Mendocino, Napa and Sonoma Counties and the Cities of Santa Rosa and Clearlake, also assertedclaims against PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility based on the damages that these government entities allegedly suffered as a result of the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires. Such a
lleged damages included, among other things, loss of natural resources, loss of public parks, property damages and fire suppressioncosts. The causes of action and 
allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs and the insurance carriers. With respect to the 2018 Camp fire,Butte County has filed simila
r claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As described below under the heading “Plan Support Agreements with PublicEntities,” on June 18, 2019, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility entered into agreements with certain government entities to potentially resolve their wildfire-relatedclaims through the Chapter 11 p
rocess. The PSAs do not require Bankruptcy Court approval to be effective; however, the Bankruptcy Court must ultimatelyapprove the Proposed Plan that inco
rporates the terms of the PSAs.180

FEMA has filed proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases in the amount of $1.2 billion in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and $2.6 billion inconnection with the 2018 Camp fir
e. FEMA has objected to the classification of their claims under the Proposed Plan as Fire Victim Claims and has indicated thatit intends to seek to have i
ts claims classified separately from the Fire Victim Claims. In addition, Cal Fire has filed proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases in theamount of $133 million in conne
ction with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and specifying at least $110 million in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. TheOES has filed proofs of claim in 
the amount of $347 million in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and $2.3 billion in connection with the 2018Camp fire. The California Dep
artment of Transportation has filed proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases in the amount of $217 million in connection with the2018 Camp fire. Certain other Fed
eral, state and local entities (that are not Supporting Public Entities) have filed proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases inconnection with the 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire asserting total claims in the amount of $503 million. Proofs of claim have also beenfiled for unspecified 
amounts to be determined at a later time. On December 12, 2019, the TCC filed an objection to the claims filed by OES in which it argued thatthe Bankruptcy Court should disallow the OES cl
aims. On January 9, 2020, the TCC filed a supplement to its objection in which it also objected to the claims filedby FEMA. On February 5, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility join
ed in the TCC's objection to the OES and FEMA claims. On February 12, 2020, a numberof individuals and businesses who hold wildf
ire-related claims in connection with the 2015 Butte fire, 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire, aswell as certain of the Tubbs Pr
eference Plaintiffs, joined in the TCC’s objection to the OES and FEMA claims. Also on February 12, 2020, OES and FEMA filedoppositions to the TCC’s objection. A hear
ing on the objection is scheduled for February 26, 2020.As described in Note 2, on July 1, 2019, the Bankruptcy Cour
t entered an order approving the Bar Date of October 21, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) for filingclaims against PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility relating to the period prior to the Petition Date, including claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the2017 Northern California wildfi
res. On November 11, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving a stipulation between PG&E Corporation and theUtility and the TCC to extend the Bar Da
te for unfiled, non-governmental fire claimants to December 31, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time). See “Potential Claims”in Note 2 above.
Regardless of any determin
ations of cause by Cal Fire with respect to any pre-petition fire, ultimately PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability will bedetermined through the Chapt
er 11 process (including the settlement agreements described below), regulatory proceedings and any potential enforcementproceedings. The timing and out
come of these and other potential proceedings are uncertain.As discussed under the headings “Plan Support Agr
eements with Public Entities,” “Restructuring Support Agreement with Holders of Subrogation Claims” and“Restructuring Support Agreemen
t with the TCC,” PG&E Corporation and the Utility have entered into agreements with certain government entity claimholders,certain insurance subrog
ation claimholders, and the TCC and the Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals, which agreements would potentially resolve all wildfire-related claims a
rising from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. The resolution of claims asserted by certain federal and Californiagovernment entities th
at are not Supporting Public Entities is contemplated by the TCC RSA, however, no government entity is a party to the TCC RSA, andaccordingly there can b
e no assurance that such government entities will support the Proposed Plan or the treatment of their claims in the Chapter 11 cases asprovided by the Proposed Plan.
Proceeding in San Francisco County Superior Court for Certain Tubbs Fire-Related Claims (the “Tubbs Trial”)
In connection with the TCC RSA, on December 26, 2019, the San Fran
cisco Superior Court entered an order vacating all dates and deadlines in the Tubbs Trialand scheduled a hearing for M
arch 2, 2020 to show cause regarding dismissal of the Tubbs Trial.On January 6, 2020, in accordance with th
e terms of the TCC RSA, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorityto enter into settle
ment agreements settling and liquidating the claims asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility by each of the Tubbs preferenceplaintiffs. On January 30, 2020, the Bankrup
tcy Court issued an order granting PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s motion to enter into settlement agreementswith each of the Tubbs prefer
ence plaintiffs.Wildfire Claims Estimation Proce
eding in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Estimation Proceeding”)On July 18, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility fi
led a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for entry of an order establishing procedures and schedules for theestimation of PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s aggregate liability for certain claims arising out of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfiresand the 2015 Butte fire.
181

On August 21, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court issued recommendations to the District Court recommending the District Court order the partial withdrawal of thereference of the se
ction 502(c) estimation of unliquidated claims arising from the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires. On August 23, 2019,the District Court issued an ord
er adopting the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Court in full and ordering that the reference to the Bankruptcy Court bewithdrawn in part.
On October 9, 2019, the District Court issued 
an initial order for the estimation hearings to begin on February 18, 2020 and conclude on February 28, 2020, withthe possibility of an addit
ional week of hearings if warranted.In connection with the TCC RSA, on December 20, 2019, the Dist
rict Court entered an order staying the Estimation Proceeding and vacating the February 18,2020 hearing and all pre-he
aring dates.Plan Support Agreements with Public Entities
On June 18, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility ent

“2017 Northern California Wildfire Public Entities”);•
the Town of Paradise;•
the County of Butte;•
the Paradise Recreation & Park District;•
the County of Yuba; and•
the Calaveras County Water District.For purposes of each PSA, the local public 
entities that are party to such PSA are referred to herein as “Supporting Public Entities.”Each PSA provides that the Proposed Plan will in
clude, among other things, the following elements:•
following the effective date of the Proposed Plan, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will remit a Settlement Amount (as defined below) in the amount setforth below to the applicab
le Supporting Public Entities in full and final satisfaction and discharge of their Public Entity Wildfire Claims, and•
subject to the Supporting Public Entities voting affirmatively to accept the Proposed Plan, following the effective date of the Proposed Plan, PG&ECorporation and the Utility wil
l create and promptly fund $10.0 million to a segregated fund to be used by the Supporting Public Entities collectively inconnection with the defense o
r resolution of claims against the Supporting Public Entities by third parties relating to the wildfires noted above (“ThirdParty Claims”).
The “Settlement Amount” se
t forth in each PSA is as follows:•
for the 2017 Northern California Wildfire Public Entities, $415.0 million (which amount will be allocated among such entities),•
for the Town of Paradise, $270.0 million,•
for the County of Butte, $252.0 million,182

•for the Paradise Recreation & Park District, $47.5 million,•
for the County of Yuba, $12.5 million, and•
for the Calaveras County Water District, $3.0 million.Each PSA provides that, subject to ce
rtain terms and conditions, the Supporting Public Entities will support the Proposed Plan with respect to its treatment of theirrespective Public Entity 
Wildfire Claims, including by voting to accept the Proposed Plan in the Chapter 11 Cases.Each PSA may be terminated by the 
applicable Supporting Public Entities under certain circumstances, including:•
if the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the OES fails to agree that no reimbursement is required from the Supporting Public Entities onaccount of assistance r
endered by either agency in connection with the wildfires noted above, and•
by any individual Supporting Public Entity, if a material amount of Third Party Claims is filed against such Supporting Public Entity and such Third PartyClaims are not releas
ed pursuant to the Proposed Plan.Each PSA may be terminated by PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility under certain circumstances, including if:•
PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not obtain the consent, or the waiver of the lack of consent as a defense, of their insurance carriers for the policyyears 2017 and 2018,
•
the Board of Directors of either PG&E Corporation or the Utility determines in good faith that continued performance under the PSA would beinconsistent with the exer
cise of its fiduciary duties, and•
any Supporting Public Entity terminates a PSA, in which case PG&E Corporation and the Utility may terminate any other PSA.Restructuring Support Agreement with Holders of Subrogation Claims
On September 22, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with the Consenting Subrogation Creditors ofinsurance subrogation cla
ims, which agreement was amended and restated on November 1, 2019 and subsequently further amended during November andDecember 2019 (as amended, th
e “Subrogation RSA”). The Subrogation RSA provides for an aggregate amount of $11.0 billion (the “Aggregate SubrogationRecovery”) to be paid by PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility pursuant to the Proposed Plan in order to settle the Subrogation Claims, upon the terms and conditionsset forth in the Subrogation RSA. Under the Subroga
tion RSA, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also agreed to reimburse the holders of Subrogation Claimsfor professional fees of up 
to $55 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Subrogation RSA.The Subrogation RSA provides that, subject to 
certain terms and conditions (including that PG&E Corporation and the Utility remain solvent), the ConsentingSubrogation Creditors will support th
e Proposed Plan with respect to its treatment of the Subrogation Claims, including by voting their Subrogation Claims toaccept the Proposed Plan in the Chap
ter 11 Cases.On September 24, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to enter into, and perform under, theSubrogation RSA and approving the terms of th
e settlement contemplated under the Subrogation RSA. On December 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered anorder granting PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s motion to approve the Subrogation RSA.On December 31, 2019, the Ad Hoc Noteholder Commit
tee filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to vacate the Bankruptcy Court’s order approving theSubrogation RSA in its entirety or, in th
e alternative, vacate the Bankruptcy Court’s order approving the Subrogation RSA and condition approval of theSubrogation RSA on removal of certain p
rovisions contained therein. Pursuant to the Noteholder RSA, the Ad Hoc Noteholder Committee withdrew its motion onFebruary 5, 2020.
183

The Subrogation RSA will automatically terminate if (i) the Proposed Plan is not confirmed by June 30, 2020 (or such later date as may be authorized by anyamendment to AB 1054) or (ii) th
e Effective Date does not occur prior to December 31, 2020 (or six months following the deadline for confirmation of theProposed Plan if such deadline is ex
tended by any amendment to AB 1054).The Subrogation RSA may be terminated by 
any Consenting Subrogation Creditor as to itself if the Aggregate Subrogation Recovery is modified. The SubrogationRSA may be terminated by the Consenting Subrog
ation Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the Subrogation Claims held by Consenting Subrogation Creditorsunder certain circu
mstances, including, among others, if (i) they reasonably determine in good faith at any time prior to confirmation of the Proposed Plan thatPG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e insolvent or otherwise unable to raise sufficient capital to pay the Aggregate Subrogation Recovery on the Effective Date,(ii) PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity breach the terms of the Subrogation RSA or otherwise fail to take certain actions specified in the Subrogation RSA, (iii) theProposed Plan does not treat the ind
ividual plaintiffs’ wildfire-related claims consistent with the provisions of AB 1054, (iv) the Bankruptcy Court allows a planproponent other than PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility to commence soliciting votes on a plan (other than the Proposed Plan) that incorporates the terms of thesettlement contemp
lated by the Subrogation RSA and PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not already commenced soliciting votes on the Proposed Plan whichincorporates such settl
ement, (v) the Bankruptcy Court confirms a plan other than the Proposed Plan or (vi) the Proposed Plan is modified to be inconsistent withsuch settlement. The Subrogat
ion RSA may be terminated by PG&E Corporation and the Utility (a) in the event of certain breaches of the Subrogation RSA byConsenting Subrogation Creditors holding a
t least 5% of the Subrogation Claims held by Consenting Subrogation Creditors or (b) if the Bankruptcy Courtconfirms a plan other th
an the Proposed Plan or if the terms of the Proposed Plan related to the settlement contemplated by the Subrogation RSA becomeunenforceable or are 
enjoined.Subject to certain li
mited exceptions, the valuation of the Subrogation Claims in an aggregate amount of $11.0 billion (the “Allowed Subrogation Claim Amount”)will survive any termina
tion of the Subrogation RSA and will be binding on PG&E Corporation and the Utility in the Chapter 11 Cases.Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC
On December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement, which was subsequently amended on December 16,2019, with the TCC, the Consenting Fire Claimant Pro
fessionals and the Shareholder Proponents (as amended, the “TCC RSA”). The TCC RSA provides for,among other things, an aggrega
te of $13.5 billion in value to be provided by PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Proposed Plan (together with certainadditional rights, the “Aggr
egate Fire Victim Consideration”) in order to settle and discharge the Fire Victim Claims, upon the terms and conditions set forth in theTCC RSA and the Proposed Plan. The Aggregate Fire Victim Conside
ration is to be funded into a trust (the “Fire Victim Trust”) to be established pursuant to theProposed Plan for the benefit of ho
lders of the Fire Victim Claims and will consist of (a) $5.4 billion in cash contributed on the effective date of the Proposed Plan,(b) $1.35 billion in cash compr
ising (i) $650 million paid in cash on or before January 15, 2021 and (ii) $700 million paid in cash on or before January 15, 2022,subject to the terms of 
a tax benefit payment agreement to be entered into between the Fire Victim Trust and the reorganized Utility, and (c) $6.75 billion incommon stock of the reorgan
ized PG&E Corporation valued at 14.9 times Normalized Estimated Net Income (as defined in the TCC RSA), except that the FireVictim Trust’s share ownership o
f the reorganized PG&E Corporation will not be less than 20.9% based on the number of fully diluted shares of the reorganizedPG&E Corporation outstanding as of the e
ffective date of the Proposed Plan, assuming the Utility’s current allowed ROE. Under certain circumstances, includingcertain change of control tra
nsactions and in connection with the monetization of certain tax benefits related to the payment of wildfire-related claims, thepayments described in (b) wi
ll be accelerated and payable upon an earlier date. The Aggregate Fire Victim Consideration also includes (1) the assignment byPG&E Corporation and the Utility to th
e Fire Victim Trust of certain rights and causes of action related to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires and the 2018 Camp fir
e (together, the “Fires”) that PG&E Corporation and the Utility may have against certain third parties and (2) the assignment ofrights under the 2015 and 2016 insuranc
e policies to resolve any claims related to the Fires in those policy years, other than the rights of PG&E Corporation andthe Utility to be reimbu
rsed under the 2015 insurance policies for claims submitted prior to the Petition Date.184

Under the terms of the Proposed Plan, all Fire Victim Claims, including claims by uninsured and underinsured individual claimholders as well as governmententities that are no
t Supporting Public Entities (including FEMA and OES/Cal Fire), would be settled and discharged in consideration of the payment of theAggregate Fire Victim Consider
ation to the Fire Victim Trust. However, the TCC RSA is an agreement among PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the TCC, theShareholder Proponents, and the Consenting Fi
re Claimant Professionals, which are attorneys representing individual claimholders. No individual claimholder orgovernment entity (inc
luding FEMA and OES/Cal Fire) is a party to the TCC RSA. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such claimholders or governmententities will support the Propos
ed Plan or the treatment of their Fire Victim Claims in the Chapter 11 Cases as provided in the Proposed Plan.In addition, each party to 
the TCC RSA must, among other things, (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to support and cooperate with PG&E Corporation andthe Utility to obtain conf
irmation of the Proposed Plan and any necessary regulatory or other approvals, and (b) oppose efforts and procedures to confirm the AdHoc Noteholder Plan. Each party to th
e TCC RSA also must not, among other things, (1) object to, delay, impede, or take any other action to interfere withacceptance, confir
mation or implementation of the Proposed Plan or (2) propose, file or support any other plan of reorganization, restructuring, or sale of assetswith respect to PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility. Each Consenting Fire Claimant Professional must use all reasonable efforts to advise and recommend to itsexisting and future cli
ents (who hold Fire Victim Claims) to support and vote to accept the Proposed Plan and to opt-in to consensual releases under the ProposedPlan.
The TCC RSA will automatically term
inate under certain circumstances, including, among others, if (a) a sufficient number of Fire Victim Claims votes to acceptthe Proposed Plan such that the cl
ass of Fire Victim Claims in the Proposed Plan votes to accept the Proposed Plan under 11 U.S.C. § 1126(c) as determined by theBankruptcy Court are not made by th
e later of (i) the voting deadline for the Proposed Plan or (ii) June 30, 2020, (b) the disclosure statement for the Proposed Planis not approved by the Bankruptcy Court by Ma
rch 30, 2020 and a motion seeking approval of the settlement of the Estimation Proceeding for the Aggregate FireVictim Consideration is not f
iled by March 30, 2020, (c) the Proposed Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by June 30, 2020, or (d) the effective date ofthe Proposed Plan does not occur prior 
to August 29, 2020 (which deadlines in (b) through (d) of this paragraph may be extended by consent of PG&E Corporationand the Utility, the TCC, the Sharehold
er Proponents and the Requisite Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals (as defined below)).The TCC RSA may be terminated by the TCC or the Requisi
te Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals (consisting of (a) the TCC, acting by vote of simplemajority of its memb
ers, and (b) a group of thirteen law firms (subject to addition) that are Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals and whose initial members arespecified in the TCC RSA, acting by vote of a s
imple majority of its members) if (a) PG&E Corporation and the Utility or the Shareholder Proponents breach anyof their obligations, rep
resentations, warranties or covenants set forth in the TCC RSA, (b) PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the Shareholder Proponents failto prosecute the Proposed Plan and se
ek entry of a confirmation order that contains or is otherwise consistent with the terms of the TCC RSA, or propose, pursue orsupport a Chapter 11 plan of reorg
anization or confirmation order inconsistent with the terms of the TCC RSA or the Proposed Plan, (c) the Proposed Plan is or ismodified to be inconsisten
t with the terms of the TCC RSA, or (d) the TCC or the Requisite Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals determine on or before thedate of the Bankruptcy Court hea
ring to approve the TCC RSA that Section 4.19(f)(ii) of the Proposed Plan (and any related provisions) has not been modified totheir satisfaction. Th
e TCC RSA may be terminated by PG&E Corporation and the Utility or the Shareholder Proponents if (1) either the TCC or Consenting FireClaimant Professionals tha
t represent in the aggregate more than 8,000 holders of Fire Victim Claims breach any of their obligations, representations, warranties orcovenants set forth in the TCC RSA or (2) if 
the TCC takes any action inconsistent with its obligations under the TCC RSA or fails to take any action requiredunder the TCC RSA.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility’ obl
igation relating to the Tubbs Preference Settlements will survive any termination of the TCC RSA and will be enforceableagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity. In addition, the TCC RSA provides that, upon termination of the TCC RSA, (a) the Estimation Proceeding willimmediately reco
mmence and (b) all litigation regarding the Tubbs fire, including a determination of whether or not the Utility caused the Tubbs fire, will bedetermined by the Distri
ct Court without any reference to any state court proceeding. On December 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order grantingPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
motion to approve the TCC RSA.Pursuant to further discussions with 
claimants relating to the Ghost Ship fire, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect certain provisions of the TCC RSA to besuperseded by their revised p
lan of reorganization, and accordingly the above description of the TCC RSA has been revised to reflect the fact that claims arisingout of the Ghost Ship fire will be r
esolved separately from the TCC RSA.185

2015 Butte FireIn September 2015, a wildfire 
(the “2015 Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. Cal Fire concluded that the2015 Butte fire was caused when a gray p
ine tree contacted the Utility’s electric line, which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by theUtility and/or its veget
ation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management programultimately led to the failure of
 the tree.Third-Party Claims
On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs 
filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court ofCalifornia, County of Sacramen
to.  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.  The California Judicial Council previously hadauthorized the coordina
tion of all cases in Sacramento County.  As of January 28, 2019, 95 known complaints were filed against the Utility and its two vegetationmanagement contrac
tors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador.  The complaints involveapproximately 3,900 individua
l plaintiffs representing approximately 2,000 households and their insurance companies.  These complaints were part of, or were inthe process of being added to, th
e coordinated proceeding.  Plaintiffs sought to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inversecondemnation and negligenc
e theory of liability.  Plaintiffs also sought punitive damages.  The Utility believes a loss related to punitive damages is unlikely, butpossible. Several plainti
ffs dismissed the Utility’s two vegetation management contractors from their complaints. The Utility does not expect the number ofclaimants to incre
ase significantly in the future, because the statute of limitations for property damage and personal injury in connection with the 2015 Butte firehas expired. Further, due to the 
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and fromcommencing new lawsuits agains
t PG&E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. On January 30, 2019, the Court in the coordinatedproceeding issued an order st
aying the action.On June 22, 2017, the Superior Court of Californi
a, County of Sacramento ruled on a motion of several plaintiffs and found that the doctrine of inversecondemnation applied to th
e Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. On January 4, 2018, the Utility filed with the court a renewed motion for a legaldetermination of inverse co
ndemnation liability.On May 1, 2018, the Superior Court of Californi
a, County of Sacramento issued its ruling on the Utility’s renewed motion in which the court affirmed, with minorchanges, its tentative 
ruling dated April 25, 2018. The Utility reached agreement with two plaintiffs in the litigation to stipulate to judgment against the Utility oninverse condemnation grounds. The 
court granted the Utility’s stipulated judgment motion on November 29, 2018 and the Utility filed its appeal on December 11,2018. As a result of the filing of 
the Chapter 11 Cases, these lawsuits, including the trial and the appeal from the stipulated judgment, are stayed.In addition to the coordina
ted plaintiffs, Cal Fire, the OES, the County of Calaveras, the Calaveras County Water District, and four smaller public entities (threefire districts and th
e California Department of Veterans Affairs) brought suit or indicated that they intended to do so. The Utility settled the claims of the three fireprotection districts 
and the Calaveras County Water District.On April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a compl
aint with the Superior Court of California, County of Calaveras, seeking to recover over $87 million for its costs incurred,which proceeding is now stayed. Prior to 
the stay, the Utility and Cal Fire were also engaged in a mediation process.Also, on February 20, 2018, the County of Calaveras f
iled suit against the Utility and the Utility’s vegetation management contractors. The Utility and the Countyof Calaveras settled th
e County’s claims in November 2018 for $25 million.Further, in May 2017, the OES indicated th
at it intended to bring a claim against the Utility related to the Butte fire that it estimated to be approximately$190 million. The Utility has not 
received any information or documentation from the OES since its May 2017 statement, other than a proof of claim for$107 million filed with the Bank
ruptcy Court. In June 2017, the Utility entered into an agreement with the OES that extended its deadline to file a claim toDecember 2020.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ob
ligations with respect to such outstanding claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. Asdescribed in Note 2, the Bar Date 
for filing claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility relating to the period prior to the Petition Date, including claims inconnection with the 2015 Butte fi
re, has passed. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received numerous proofs of claim in connection with the 2015 Butte firesince the Petition Date and 
are early in the process of reconciling those claims to the amount listed in the schedules of assets and liabilities. See “Potential Claims”in Note 2 above.
186

As discussed under the headings “Plan Support Agreements with Public Entities” and “Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC,” PG&E Corporation andthe Utility have entered i
nto agreements to potentially resolve certain government entity claimholders’ wildfire-related claims arising from the 2015 Butte fire aswell as with the TCC and the Consenting Fire Cla
imant Professionals to potentially resolve all wildfire-related claims arising from the 2015 Butte fire held byindividual claimholders.
FEMA, the U.S. Department of the Interio
r, Cal Fire, the OES and certain other Federal, state and local entities (that are not Supporting Public Entities) have filedproofs of claim in the Chapt
er 11 Cases in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. Proofs of claim have also been filed for unspecified amounts to be determined at alater time.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may 
ask the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that they believe are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, arewithout merit, are overs
tated or should be disallowed for other reasons. See “Potential Claims” in Note 2.As described above under the head
ing “Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC,” under the TCC RSA, all Fire Victim Claims, including claims bygovernment entities th
at are not Supporting Public Entities (including FEMA and OES/Cal Fire) would be settled and discharged in consideration of the paymentof the Aggregate Fire Victi
m Consideration to the Fire Victim Trust. However, the TCC RSA is an agreement among PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the TCC,the Shareholder Proponents, and the Consen
ting Fire Claimant Professionals. No government entity (including FEMA and OES/Cal Fire) is party to the TCC RSA.Accordingly, there can be no assu
rance that such government entities will support the Proposed Plan or the treatment of their Fire Victim Claims in the Chapter 11Cases as provided in the Proposed Plan.
2018 Camp Fire, 2017 Northern California Wildfires and 2015 Butte Fir
e Accounting ChargeIn light of the current s
tate of the law and the information currently available to the Utility, including the PSAs, the Subrogation RSA and the TCC RSA, PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e determined that it is probable they will incur a loss for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and all 21 of the 2017Northern California wildfi
res identified above under the heading “2017 Northern California Wildfire Background”, the reasons for which are discussed in moredetail in this section b
elow. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a charge in the amount of $14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, a charge inthe amount of $3.9 billion for 
the three months ended June 30, 2019, and a charge in the amount of $2.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019.Based on additional facts and 
circumstances available to the Utility as of the date of this filing, including the entry into the TCC RSA, PG&E Corporation and theUtility recorded an addi
tional charge for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire in theamount of $5.0 billion for a to
tal charge of $11.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.In the case of the Tubbs fir
e and the 37 fire, PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to believe that if the claims related to these fires were litigated on themerits, it would not be probabl
e that they would incur a loss for such claims. As a result of the entry into the PSAs, the Subrogation RSA and the TCC RSA,PG&E Corporation and the Utility have d
etermined that it is probable they will incur a loss for claims in connection with such fires. With respect to the other 19 ofthe 2017 Northern California wild
fires (the La Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood, Sulphur, Cherokee, Blue, Pocket, Atlas, Cascade, Point, Nuns,Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Youngs and Pressley 
fires), PG&E Corporation and the Utility previously determined that it is probable they would incur a lossfor claims in connect
ion with such fires if such claims were litigated on the merits.187

The aggregate liability of $25.5 billion for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire representsPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s b
est estimate of probable losses and is subject to change based on additional information. Notwithstanding the entry into thePSAs, the Subrogation RSA and the TCC RSA, there are a number of unknown facts 
and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability,including whether any term
ination events are triggered under these agreements, whether the classification and treatment of claims in the Proposed Plan issuccessfully challenged by 
claimholders who are not party to a settlement agreement, how the claims filed by Federal, state and local entities are resolved, whethera plan of reorganizat
ion incorporating the terms of those settlements is confirmed and the ongoing criminal investigation with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. (See“Third-Party Claims, Invest
igations and Other Proceedings Related to the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires” above for a summary ofmaterial term
ination rights under the PSAs, the Subrogation RSA and the TCC RSA.) Many of these factors are beyond the control of PG&E Corporation and theUtility. If one or more of 
these settlement agreements is terminated, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s aggregate liability related to the 2018 Camp fire and2017 Northern California wildfi
res (and in certain cases, other pre-petition fires) could substantially exceed $25.5 billion. In addition, if these agreements wereterminated, regard
less of the ultimate determination of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability, such termination would be expected to result in additionaldelay and expense in the Chapte
r 11 Cases.Absent settlement agre
ements, the process for estimating losses associated with claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number ofassumptions and subjective f
actors, including but not limited to the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins,weather and climate 
related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal propertydamage, the number and types o
f trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss oflives, the extent to which fu
ture claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs or other damages the Utility may be responsible for if foundnegligent or as estima
ted in the Chapter 11 Cases.The $25.5 billion liability do
es not include any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or theUtility, or punitive damag
es, if any, or any losses related to future claims for damages that have not manifested yet, each of which could be significant. The chargealso does not include any amounts 
for potential losses in connection with the wildfire-related securities class action litigation described below or the amount of anypenalties or fines tha
t may be imposed by governmental entities, and the amount of any penalties, fines, or restitution orders that might result from any criminalcharges brought. PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility intend to continue to review the available information and other information as it becomes available. As moreinformation becomes av
ailable, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires and the 2015 Butte fi
re may change, which could result in material increases to the loss accrued.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility we
re to be found liable for any punitive damages, and such damages were allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, or if PG&ECorporation and the Utility wer
e subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, fines and penalties could be significant. PG&E Corporationand the Utility have rec
eived significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposedpenalties on the Utility 
totaling $1.6 billion in connection with the natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010(the “San Bruno explosion”). These pen
alties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 millionincurred for third-pa
rty claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposedon PG&E Corporation and the Utility could 
likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11process. Regulatory proceedings 
are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collectionefforts in connection with 
fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.188

2019 Kincade FireAccording to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at 
approximately 9:27 p.m., a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the “2019Kincade fire”), loca
ted in the service territory of the Utility. The Cal Fire Kincade Fire Incident Update dated November 20, 2019, 11:02 a.m. Pacific Time (the“incident update”) ind
icated that the 2019 Kincade fire had consumed 77,758 acres. In the incident update, Cal Fire reported no fatalities and four first responderinjuries. The incident upda
te also indicates the following: structures destroyed, 374 (consisting of 174 residential structures, 11 commercial structures and 189other structures); and s
tructures damaged, 60 (consisting of 35 residential structures, one commercial structure and 24 other structures). In connection with the2019 Kincade fire, state and 
local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings at various times for certain areas of the region.Based on County of Sonoma information, PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation orderor an evacuation warning betwe
en October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately 200,000 persons.On October 23, 2019, by 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 
the Utility had conducted a PSPS event and turned off the power to approximately 27,837 customers in SonomaCounty, including Geyserville and th
e surrounding area. As part of the PSPS, the Utility’s distribution lines in these areas were deenergized. Following theUtility’s established and CPUC-approved PSPS protocols 
and procedures, transmission lines in these areas remained energized.The Utility has submitted e
lectric incident reports to the CPUC indicating that:•
at approximately 9:19 p.m. Pacific Time on October 23, 2019, the Utility became aware of a transmission level outage on the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230kV line when the line relayed 
and did not reclose;•
various generating facilities on the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230kV line detected the disturbance and separated at approximately the same time;•
at approximately 9:21 p.m. Pacific Time, the PG&E Grid Control Center received a report that a fire had started in an area near transmission tower001/006;
•
at approximately 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time on October 24, 2019, a responding Utility troubleman patrolling the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230 kV line observedthat Cal Fire had taped off 
the area around the base of transmission tower 001/006 in the area of the 2019 Kincade fire; and•
on site Cal Fire personnel brought to the troubleman’s attention what appeared to be a broken jumper on the same tower.The cause of the 2019 Kincade fi
re is under investigation by Cal Fire and the CPUC, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with theirinvestigations. PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire. This investigation ispreliminary, and PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility do not have access to all of the evidence in the possession of Cal Fire or other third parties.Based on the facts and circu
mstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including the information contained in the electricincident report and othe
r information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it isreasonably possible that th
ey will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. However, due to the preliminary stages of the investigations, lack of accessto potentially relev
ant evidence and the uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, PG&E Corporation and theUtility cannot reasonably 
estimate the amount or range of such possible loss.While the cause of the 2019 Kin
cade fire remains under Cal Fire’s investigation and there are a number of unknown facts surrounding the cause of the 2019Kincade fire, the Utili
ty could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as on the bankruptcy timing and process and the abilityof the Utility to parti
cipate in the Wildfire Fund. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received and are responding to data requests from the CPUC’s SEDrelating to the Kincade 
fire. Various other entities, including law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertain when the investigationswill be complete.
189

Loss RecoveriesPG&E Corporation and the Utility had insu
rance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire. Additionally, there are several mechanisms that allow for recovery ofcosts from customers. Potent
ial for recovery is described below. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res or any conclusion that such recovery is no longer probable could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the inability to recover costs in a timely manner could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers that provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2015 Butte fire in an aggregate amount of$922 million. The Utility re
cords insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount orits range. Through December 31, 2019, th
e Utility recorded $922 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the 2015 Butte fire.While the Utility plans 
to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries. In addition, theUtility has received $6
0 million in cumulative reimbursements from the insurance policies of its vegetation management contractors. Recoveries of additionalamounts under the insurance po
licies of the Utility’s vegetation management contractors, including policies where the Utility is listed as an additional insured, areuncertain.
The balance for the insur
ance receivable is included in Other accounts receivable in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and was$50 million and $85 million as o
f December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, reflecting reimbursements of $35 million during the year endedDecember 31, 2019.
Insurance
In 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility r
enewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion forthe period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, co
mprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million peroccurrence), and $700 mil
lion for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million throughthe reinsurance mark
et where a catastrophe bond was utilized. In 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in anamount of $430 million (subje
ct to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence) for the period from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020, andapproximately $1 billion
 in liability insurance coverage for non-wildfire events (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence),comprised of $520 million fo
r the period from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020 and $480 million for the period from September 3, 2019 through September2, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to pursue additional insurance coverage. Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layerscould result in uninsured costs 
in the future depending on the amount and type of damages resulting from covered events.PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a receivable for insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur. ThroughDecember 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $1.38 billion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and$843 million for probable insu
rance recoveries in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. These amounts reflect an assumption that the cause ofeach fire is deemed 
to be a separate occurrence under the insurance policies.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to seek full recovery for all insured losses.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to recover the full amount of their insurance,PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires will substantially exceedtheir available insurance.
The balances for insuranc
e receivables with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires are included in Other accounts receivable inPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consol
idated Balance Sheets. The balance for insurance receivable for the 2018 Camp fire was $1.38 billion as of December31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The balance 
for insurance receivable for the 2017 Northern California wildfires was $807 million and $829 million as ofDecember 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, r
espectively.190

Regulatory RecoveryOn June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Uti
lity’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective asof July 26, 2017. The decision does not grant 
the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate recovery would require CPUC authorization in aseparate proceeding. The Ut
ility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance, if at all. Rate recovery is uncertain; therefore, the Utility has notrecorded a regulatory 
asset related to any wildfire claims costs. Even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of yearsto collect.
In addition, SB 901, signed into law on Septembe
r 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in theaggregate, so that they do not 
exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provideadequate and safe servi
ce. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referredto as “securitizat
ion”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts inexcess of the CHT. SB 901 does not authorize secu
ritization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CHT in futureapplications under Section 451.2
(a) of the Public Utilities Code for recovery of costs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.On March 29, 2019, the assigned commission
er issued a scoping memo, which confirmed that the CPUC in this proceeding would establish a CHT methodologyapplicable only to 2017 fir
es, to be invoked in connection with a future application for cost recovery and would not determine a specific financial outcome in thisproceeding.
On July 8, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision in the CHT proceeding. The CPUC decision p
rovides that “[a]n electrical corporation that has filed for relief underchapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code m
ay not access the Stress Test to recover costs in an application under Section 451.2(b), because the Commission cannotdetermine the corpor
ation’s ‘financial status,’ which includes, among other considerations, its capital structure, liquidity needs, and liabilities, as required bySection 451.2(b).” This determ
ination effectively bars PG&E Corporation and the Utility from access to relief under the CHT during the pendency of the Chapter11 Cases. On August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted to 
the CPUC an application for rehearing of the decision. The Utility indicated in its application, among otherthings, that the CPUC’s decision “is cont
rary to law because it bars a utility that has filed for Chapter 11 from accessing the CHT, requires a utility to file a costrecovery application b
efore the CHT will be determined, and erects ratepayer protection mechanisms as an extra-statutory hurdle for accessing the CHT.” TheUtility also argued that 
the CPUC should apply the CHT methodology to costs related to the 2018 Camp fire.The decision otherwise adopts a 
methodology to determine the CHT based on (1) the maximum additional debt that a utility can take on and maintain a minimuminvestment grade cred
it rating; (2) excess cash available to the utility; (3) a potential maximum regulatory adjustment of either 20% of the CHT or 5% of the totaldisallowed wildfire liab
ilities, whichever is greater; and (4) an adjustment to preserve for ratepayers any tax benefits associated with the CHT. The decision alsorequires a utility to 
include proposed ratepayer protection measures to mitigate harm to ratepayers as part of an application under Section 451.2(b).Failure to obtain a substant
ial or full recovery of costs related to wildfires could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity and cash flows.Wildfire-Related Derivativ
e LitigationTwo purported derivative lawsui
ts alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court onNovember 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respect
ively, naming as defendants current and certain former members of the Board of Directors and certain currentand former officers o
f PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are named as nominal defendants. These lawsuits were consolidatedby the court on February 14, 2018, and are d
enominated In Re California North Bay Fire Derivati ve Litigation. On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs fi led aconsolidated complaint. Af
ter the parties reached an agreement regarding a stay of the derivative proceeding pending resolution of the tort actions described aboveand any regulatory proceed
ing relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, on April 24, 2018, the court entered a stipulation and order to stay. The stay issubject to certain cond
itions regarding the plaintiffs’ access to discovery in other actions. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a request to lift the stay for thepurposes of amending their co
mplaint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire.191

On August 3, 2018, a third purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retiremen t System v. Chew, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northe
rn District of California, naming as defendants certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and certain current andformer officers of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation is named as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciaryduties and unjust enrichmen
t as well as a claim under Section 14(a) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 alleging that PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s 2017 proxy statemen
t contained misrepresentations regarding the companies’ risk management and safety programs. On October 15, 2018, PG&ECorporation filed a motion 
to stay the litigation. Prior to the scheduled hearing on this motion, this matter was automatically stayed by PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s commenc
ement of bankruptcy proceedings, as discussed below.On October 23, 2018, a fourth purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled City of Warren Police and Fire Re tirement System v. Chew, et al., was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleging cla
ims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust enrichment. It names as defendants certain current and formermembers of the Board of Dire
ctors and certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation, and names PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant. Theplaintiff filed a 
request with the court seeking the voluntary dismissal of this matter without prejudice on January 18, 2019.On November 21, 2018, a fifth purported de
rivative lawsuit, entitled Williams v. Earley, Jr., et al. , was filed in federal cou rt in San Francisco, alleging claimsidentical to those al
leged in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retiremen t System v. Chew, et al. lawsuit listed above agains t certain current and formerofficers and directo
rs, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. This lawsuit includes allegations related to the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and 
the 2018 Camp fire. This action was stayed by stipulation of the parties and order of the court on December 21, 2018, subject to resolutionof the pending securities 
class action.On December 24, 2018, a sixth purported de
rivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger v. Chew, et al. , was filed in San Francisco Superior Cour t, alleging claims forbreach of fiduciary duty, 
abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and formerofficers and directo
rs, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. On February 5, 2019, the plaintiff in Bowlinger v. Chew, et al.  filed a response to the notice asse
rting that the automatic stay did not apply to his claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility accordingly filed a Motion to Enforce theAutomatic Stay with the Bankruptcy Cour
t as to the Bowlinger  action, which was granted. The cour t has scheduled a case management conference for July 10,2020.
On January 25, 2019, a seventh purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg v. Chew, et al. , was filed in San Francisco Superior Cour t, alleging claims forbreach of fiduciary duty, 
abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and formerofficers and directo
rs, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants.On January 28, 2019, an eighth purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled Blackburn v. Meserve, et al. , was filed in federal cou rt alleging claims for breach of fiduciaryduty, unjust enrichment, and wast
e of corporate assets in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire against certain current andformer officers and d
irectors, and naming PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed notices in each of these proceedings on February 1, 2019, reflectingthat the proceedings ar
e automatically stayed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s rights with respect to thederivative claims 
asserted against former officers and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were assigned to the Fire Victim Trust under the TCC RSA.192

Securities Class Action LitigationWildfire-Related Class Action
In June 2018, two purported securiti
es class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming PG&ECorporation and certain of 
its current and former officers as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al.  and Jon Paul Moretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al.
, respectively.  The compl aints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, vegetation management andtransmission line safe
ty in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the federalSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rul
e 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Bothcomplaints identifi
ed a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases and the litigation is nowdenominated 
In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion. The court also appointed the Publ ic Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico as leadplaintiff. The plaint
iff filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. After the plaintiff requested leave to amend their complaint to add allegationsregarding the 2018 Camp fire, 
the plaintiff filed a second amended consolidated complaint on December 14, 2018.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a notice on February 1, 2019, reflecting that the proceedings areautomatically stay
ed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 15, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a complaint in BankruptcyCourt against the plai
ntiff seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims alleged against the individual officer defendants.On February 22, 2019, a purported securit
ies class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retirement Fund, 
et al. v. Rambo, et al. (the “York County Action”). The compl aint names as defendants certain current and formerofficers and directo
rs, as well as the underwriters of four public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is named as adefendant. The complaint 
alleges material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures. The complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of theSecurities Act of 1933, and seeks unspe
cified monetary relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs, and injunctive relief. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action wasconsolidated with 
In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion.On May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the 
consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims assertedin the previously-filed 
actions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain current and former officers and directors, and the underwriters. Theaction remains stayed 
as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. On August 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court denied PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s request toextend the stay to the cl
aims against the officer, director, and underwriter defendants. On October 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filedmotions to dismiss the third 
amended complaint, which motions are currently under submission with the District Court.De-energization Class Action
On October 25, 2019, a purported securit
ies class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Vataj v. Johnson et al.
 The complaint names as de fendants a current director and certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation. Neither PG&E Corporation northe Utility is named as a d
efendant. The complaint alleges materially false and misleading statements regarding PG&E Corporation’s wildfire prevention and safetyprotocols and policies, inc
luding regarding the Utility’s public safety power shutoffs, that allegedly resulted in losses and damages to holders of PG&ECorporation’s securities. Th
e complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under, the Exchange Act of 1934,and seeks unspecified monet
ary relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs. On February 3, 2020, the District Court granted a stipulation appointing Iron Workers Local580 Joint Funds, Ironworkers Locals 40,361 & 417 Union Securi
ty Funds and Robert Allustiarti co-lead plaintiffs and approving the selection of the plaintiffs’counsel, and further order
ed the parties to submit a proposed schedule by February 13, 2020. On February 11, 2020, the parties submitted a proposed caseschedule.
Given the early stages of th
e litigations, including but not limited to the fact that defendants’ motions to dismiss have not yet been heard and no discovery hasoccurred in the consolida
ted class action litigation, and that the de-energization class action was recently filed, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable toreasonably estimate 
the amount of any potential loss.193

Indemnification ObligationsTo the extent permitt
ed by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while adirector or office
r is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations extend to the claims asserted against the directors and officers in thesecurities class ac
tion. PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain directors and officers insurance coverage to reduce their exposure to such indemnificationobligations. PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity have provided notice to their insurance carriers of the claims asserted in the wildfire-related securities class actionsand derivative litigation, a
nd are in communication with the carriers regarding the applicability of the directors and officers insurance policies to those matters.PG&E Corporation and the Utility addi
tionally have potential indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to theunderwriting agreements 
associated with those offerings. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's indemnification obligations to the officers, directors andunderwriters may be lim
ited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases.District Attorneys’ Offi
ces’ InvestigationsDuring the second quarter of 2018, Cal Fi
re issued news releases stating that it referred the investigations related to the McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Sulphur, Blue,Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and At
las fires to the appropriate county District Attorney’s offices for review “due to evidence of alleged violations ofstate law.” On March 12, 2019, the Sonoma, Napa, Humbo
ldt and Lake County District Attorneys announced that they would not prosecute PG&E Corporation orthe Utility for the fi
res in those counties, which include the Sulphur, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and Atlas fires.PG&E Corporation and the Utility were 
the subject of criminal investigations by the Nevada County District Attorney’s Office to whom Cal Fire had referred itsinvestigations into the McCour
tney and Lobo fires. On July 23, 2019, the Nevada County District Attorney informed PG&E Corporation and the Utility of hisdecision not to pursue crim
inal charges in connection with the McCourtney and Lobo fires.The Honey fire was referred 
to the Butte County District Attorney’s Office, and in October 2018, the Utility reached an agreement to settle any civil claims orcriminal charges th
at could have been brought by the Butte County District Attorney in connection with the Honey fire, as well as the La Porte and Cherokee fires(which Cal Fire did not refer 
to the Butte County District Attorney for investigation). The settlement provides for funding by the Utility in the amount of up to$1.5 million, not recoverab
le in rates, for fire prevention work.On October 9, 2018, the Office of the Dist
rict Attorney of Yuba County announced its decision not to pursue criminal charges at such time against PG&ECorporation or the Utility pe
rtaining to the Cascade fire. The District Attorney’s Office also indicated that it reserved the right “to review any additionalinformation or evidenc
e that may be submitted to it prior to the expiration of the criminal statute of limitations.”In addition, the Butte County Distri
ct Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office have opened a criminal investigation of the 2018 Camp fire.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have b
een informed by the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office that a grandjury has been empaneled in But
te County, and the Utility was served with subpoenas in the grand jury investigation. The Utility has produced documents andcontinues to produce documents 
and respond to other requests for information and witness testimony in connection with the criminal investigation of the 2018Camp fire, including, but not l
imited to, documents related to the operation and maintenance of equipment owned or operated by the Utility. The Utility has alsocooperated with the Butte County Dist
rict Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office in the collection of physical evidence from equipmentowned or operated by the Utility. PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing and outcome of the criminal investigation into the 2018 Campfire. The Utility could be sub
ject to material fines, penalties, or restitution orders if it is determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws andregulations, as well as non-mon
etary remedies such as oversight requirements. The criminal investigation is not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result ofthe commencement of 
the Chapter 11 Cases. On October 17, 2019, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office filedproofs of claim in the Chapt
er 11 Cases of an undetermined amount on the basis of the criminal investigation of the 2018 Camp fire.Additional investigations and o
ther actions may arise out of the other 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. The timing and outcome forresolution of the rema
ining referrals by Cal Fire to the appropriate county District Attorneys’ offices are uncertain.194

SEC InvestigationOn March 20, 2019, PG&E Corporation learned tha
t the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office is conducting an investigation related to PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s public disc
losures and accounting for losses associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict the timing and outcome of the investigation.Clean-up and Repair Costs
The Utility incurred costs o
f $772 million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities (including $323 million in capital expenditures) through December 31,2019, in connection with the 2018 Camp fi
re. The Utility also incurred costs of $357 million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities (including$180 million in capital 
expenditures) through December 31, 2019, in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The Utility is authorized to track andseek recovery of clean
-up and repair costs through CEMA. (CEMA requests are subject to CPUC approval.) The Utility capitalizes and records as regulatory assetscosts that are probable o
f recovery. At December 31, 2019, the CEMA regulatory asset balances related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires were zero and $69 m
illion, respectively, and are included in long-term regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the capitalexpenditures for clean
-up and repair are included in property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019.Should PG&E Corporation and the Utility conc
lude that recovery of any clean-up and repair costs included in the CEMA is no longer probable, PG&E Corporationand the Utility will reco
rd a charge in the period such conclusion is reached. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of these costs could have a materialeffect on PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Wildfire Assistance Fund
On May 24, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an o
rder authorizing PG&E Corporation and the Utility to establish and fund a program (the “Wildfire AssistanceFund”) to assist those displaced by 
the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires with the costs of substitute or temporary housing and other urgentneeds. The Utility fully funded $105 
million into the Wildfire Assistance Fund on August 2, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the administrator issued claimantpayments totaling $64 mil
lion under the Wildfire Assistance Fund.Wildfire Fund under AB 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed 
into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available foreligible electric utility companies t
o pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electricutility company’s equipm
ent, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Eligible claims are claims for third party damages resulting from any such wildfires,limited to the portion of
 such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1 billion in the aggregate in any calendar year and (ii) the amount of insurance coveragerequired to be in place 
for the electric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.Electric utility 
companies that draw from the fund will only be required to repay amounts that are determined by the CPUC in an application for cost recovery notto be just and reasonable, subj
ect to a rolling three-year disallowance cap equal to 20% of the electric utility company’s transmission and distribution equity ratebase. For the Utility, this disa
llowance cap is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion for the three-year period starting in 2019, subject to adjustment based onchanges in the Utility’s to
tal transmission and distribution equity rate base. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if the WildfireFund administrator determi
nes that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willfuldisregard for the rights 
and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC determines to be justand reasonable will not need 
to be repaid to the fund, resulting in a draw-down of the fund.195

The Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i)$10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds support
ed by a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resources charge to ratepayers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initialcontributions from Califo
rnia’s three investor-owned electric utility companies and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three investor-owned electric utili
ty companies. The contributions from the investor-owned electric utility companies will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, asthey will not be permitt
ed to recover these costs from ratepayers. The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the three investor-ownedelectric utility companies purs
uant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation metric” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable utility’s service territoryclassified as high fir
e threat districts and adjusted to account for risk mitigation efforts. The Utility’s initial Wildfire Fund allocation metric is expected to be 64.2%(representing an init
ial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions of approximately $193 million). In addition, all initial and annualcontributions will be exclud
ed from the measurement of the Utility’s authorized capital structure. The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligibleclaims so long as there a
re sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result ofclaims made by California’s
 other participating electric utility companies.AB 1054 also provides that the first $5.0 b
illion expended in the aggregate by California’s three investor-owned electric utility companies on fire risk mitigationcapital expenditures 
included in their respective approved wildfire mitigation plans will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion ofcapital expenditures will 
be allocated among the investor-owned electric utility companies in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics (describedabove). AB 1054 contemplates that su
ch capital expenditures may be securitized through a customer charge.On July 23, 2019, the Utility notified th
e CPUC of its intent to participate in the Wildfire Fund. On August 7, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility submitted amotion with the Bankruptcy Court for 
the entry of an order authorizing PG&E Corporation and the Utility to participate in the Wildfire Fund and to make anyinitial and annual cont
ributions to the Wildfire Fund upon emergence from Chapter 11. On August 26, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting suchauthorizations. In order 
to participate in the Wildfire Fund, the Utility must also meet the eligibility and other requirements set forth in AB 1054, and pay its shareof the initial contr
ibution to the Wildfire Fund upon emergence from Chapter 11. In such event (assuming the Utility satisfies the eligibility and other requirementsset forth in AB 1054), the Wildfi
re Fund will be available to the Utility to pay for eligible claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’semergence from Chapte
r 11, subject to a limit of 40% of the amount of such claims. The balance of any such claims would need to be addressed through theChapter 11 Cases.
The Utility expects to re
cord its required contributions as an asset and amortize the asset over the estimated life of the Wildfire Fund. The Wildfire Fund asset willbe further adjusted for 
impairment as the assets are used to pay eligible claims, which will result in decreases to the assets available for coverage of future events.AB 1054 does not establish a definite 
term of the Wildfire Fund; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant judgments and estimates. Theassumptions create a high d
egree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The most significant assumption is the number andseverity of catastrophic fires
 that could occur in California within the participating electric utilities’ service territories during the term of the Wildfire Fund. TheUtility intends to utilize
 historical, publicly available fire-loss data as a starting point; however, future fire-loss can be difficult to estimate due to uncertaintiesaround the impacts of cl
imate change, land use changes, and mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies. Other assumptions include the estimatedcost of wildfires caused by oth
er electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claims will be settled, the likely adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electricutility-caused wildfi
res, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth ofother electric utilities. Significa
nt changes in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period. There could also be a significant delaybetween the occurrence o
f a wildfire and the timing of which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of dataavailable to the Util
ity following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another electric utility. As of December 31, 2019,the Utility has not refl
ected the required contributions in its Consolidated Financial Statements as it has not yet satisfied all of the Wildfire Fund eligibility criteriapursuant to AB 1054.
196

In order to participate in the Wildfire Fund, within 60 days of the effective date of AB 1054, the Utility must obtain the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of theUtility’s election to p
ay the initial and annual Wildfire Fund contributions upon emergence from Chapter 11, which approval was granted by the Bankruptcy Courton August 26, 2019. The Utility would then be requir
ed to pay its share of the initial contribution to the Wildfire Fund upon emergence from Chapter 11, and meetcertain eligibil
ity requirements listed below, in order to participate in the Wildfire Fund. In such event (assuming the Utility satisfies the eligibility and otherrequirements set for
th in AB 1054), the Wildfire Fund will be available to the Utility to pay for eligible claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 andthe Utility’s emergen
ce from Chapter 11, subject to a limit of 40% of the amount of such claims. The balance of any such claims would need to be addressedthrough the Chapter 11 Cases. There a
re several additional eligibility requirements for the Utility, including that by June 30, 2020, the following conditions aresatisfied:
•
the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case has been resolved pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar document not subject to a stay;•
the Bankruptcy Court has determined that the resolution of the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case provides funding or otherwise provides for the satisfaction ofany pre-petition wildfi
re claims asserted against the Utility in the Chapter 11 Case, in the amounts agreed upon in any settlement agreements, authorizedby the Bankruptcy Court through an esti
mation process or otherwise allowed by the Bankruptcy Court;•
the CPUC has approved the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case, including the Utility’s resultinggovernance structure as 
being acceptable in light of the Utility’s safety history, criminal probation, recent financial condition and other factors deemedrelevant by the CPUC;
•
the CPUC has determined that the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case are (i) consistent with California’sclimate goals as requ
ired pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program and related procurement requirements and (ii) neutral, onaverage, to the Utility
’s ratepayers; and•
the CPUC has determined that the Utility’s plan of reorganization and other documents resolving its Chapter 11 Case recognize the contributions ofratepayers, if any, and co
mpensate them accordingly through mechanisms approved by the CPUC, which may include sharing of value appreciation.NOTE 15: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND 
COMMITMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigationmatters and environmen
tal remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of theloss can be reasonably esti
mated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lowerend of the range, unless an amoun
t within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costsfrom the provision for loss and 
expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered intoto support its operating ac
tivities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial commitments described in “Other Commitments”below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of thefollowing matters.
Enforcement Matters
U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
In connection with the Utili
ty’s probation proceeding, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has the ability to impose additionalprobation conditions on the Util
ity. Additional conditions, if implemented, could be wide-ranging and would impact the Utility’s operations, number of employees,costs and financial per
formance. Depending on the terms of these additional requirements, costs in connections with such requirements could have a material effecton PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.197

CPUC and FERC MattersOrder Instituting Investigation into the 2017 Northern California Wildf
ires and the 2018 Camp FireOn June 27, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII (the “Wildfir
es OII”) to determine whether the Utility “violated any provision(s) of the California Public Utilities Code(PU Code), Commission General Orders (GO) or dec
isions, or other applicable rules or requirements pertaining to the maintenance and operation of its electricfacilities that we
re involved in igniting fires in its service territory in 2017.” On December 5, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a second amended scopingmemo and ruling that am
ended the scope of issues to be considered in this proceeding to include the 2018 Camp Fire.On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of th
e CPUC, the CPUC's Office of the Safety Advocate, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposedsettlement agree
ment in connection with this proceeding and jointly moved for its approval.In January 2020, several part
ies that are not part of the settlement agreement, including TURN, The City and County of San Francisco, Thomas Del Monte, theWild Tree Foundation, and the CPUC’s Public Advocat
es Office, have filed public comments seeking modifications to the settlement agreement. Among othercomments, TURN, Cal Advocates, and Del Monte asse
rt that the $1.675 billion in financial obligations imposed on the Utility under the proposed settlementagreement are insuf
ficient and propose additional potential penalties that should be imposed on the Utility. The assigned administrative law judge and/or theassigned commissioner overs
eeing the proceeding will review the proposed settlement and comments, and may set a hearing, before a final CPUC decision isissued.
Pursuant to the settleme
nt agreement, the Utility agrees to (i) not seek rate recovery of wildfire-related expenses and capital expenditures in future applications inthe amount of $1.625 billion, as spe
cified below, and (ii) incur costs of $50 million in shareholder-funded system enhancement initiatives as described further inthe settlement agr
eement. The settlement agreement stipulates that no violations have been identified in the Tubbs fire. As a result of this finding, the settlementagreement does not preven
t the Utility from seeking recovery of costs associated with the Tubbs fire through rates. The amounts set forth in the table below includeactual recorded costs 
and forecasted cost estimates for expenses and capital expenditures which the Utility has incurred or will incur to comply with its legalobligations to provide safe 
and reliable service.(in millions)

ek rate recovery for Transmission Safety Repairs will be adjusted so that the total amount for which the Utility shall not seek raterecovery equals $1.625 billion.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.As of December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded charges of $344 million, related to the portion of the $403 million in disallowed capital thathad been spent through December 31, 2019 
and, in 2020, expects to record $59 million related to capital expenditures listed in the table above. In addition, PG&ECorporation and Utility reco
rded charges of approximately $55 million related to vegetation management and catastrophic event expense costs that were previouslydetermined to be probabl
e of recovery and expects to record an additional $29 million in expenses in 2020.198

The Utility expects that the system enhancement spending pursuant to the settlement agreement will occur through 2025.The settlement agre
ement will become effective upon: (i) approval by the CPUC in a written decision, (ii) following such approval by the CPUC, approval of theUnited States Bankruptcy Court, Northern Dis
trict of California, San Francisco Division, and (iii) the effectiveness of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization for theUtility approving the
 implementation of the settlement agreement. The CPUC may accept, reject or propose alternative terms to the settlement agreement,including imposing penalti
es on the Utility. The Utility has requested that the CPUC approve the settlement on an expedited basis by the end of February 2020.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding.Order Instituting an Investigation and Order to Show Cause into the Utility’s Locate and Mark prac
ticesOn December 14, 2018, the CPUC issued an OII and order to show caus
e to assess the Utility’s practices and procedures related to the locating and marking ofnatural gas facili
ties. The OII directed the Utility to show cause as to why the CPUC should not find violations in this matter, and why the CPUC should notimpose penalties, and/or 
any other forms of relief, if any violations are found. The Utility was also directed in the OII to provide a report on specific matters,including that it is conduc
ting locate and mark programs in a safe manner.The OII cited a report by th
e SED dated December 6, 2018, which alleges that the Utility violated the law pertaining to the locating and marking of its gas facilitiesand falsified records 
related to its locate and mark activities between 2012 and 2017. As described in the OII, the SED cites reports issued in this matter by twoconsultants retained by th
e Utility, that (i) included certain facts and conclusions about the extent of inaccuracies in the Utility’s late tickets and the reasons for theinaccuracies, and (i
i) provided an analysis, based on the available data, of tickets that should be properly categorized as late, and identification of associated dig-ins. As a result, the OII will det
ermine whether the Utility violated any provision of the Public Utilities Code, general orders, federal law adopted by California,other rules, or require
ments, and/or other state or federal law, by its locate and mark policies, practices, and related issues, and the extent to which the Utility’spractices with regard 
to locate and mark may have diminished system safety.On March 14, 2019, as directed by the CPUC, the Utili
ty submitted a report that addressed the SED report and responded to the order to show cause.  A prehearingconference was held on April 4, 2019, to 
establish scope and a procedural schedule.  The assigned commissioner and ALJ encouraged the SED and the Utility toengage in settlement d
iscussions.  On April 24, 2019, the Utility provided notice of a settlement conference and the parties began ongoing settlement discussions. On May 7, 2019, the assigned commissioner 
issued a scoping memo and ruling that included within the proceedings, in addition to the issues identified in the OIIrelating to the Utility’s l
ocate and mark procedures, issues relating to locating and marking of the Utility’s electric distribution facilities and the use of “qualifiedelectrical workers
” for locating and marking underground infrastructure. On July 24, 2019, the SED submitted its opening testimony to the CPUC.  A statusconference with the ALJ was held on July 30, 2019. 
Intervenor testimony was submitted on August 16, 2019, and the Utility’s reply testimony was submitted onSeptember 18, 2019.
On October 3, 2019, the Utility, SED and CUE jointly submit
ted to the CPUC a proposed settlement agreement. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Utilityagreed to a total fin
ancial remedy of $65 million, comprised of (i) a fine of $5 million funded by shareholders to be paid to the General Fund of the State ofCalifornia pursuant to, and in 
accordance with, the time frame and other provisions governing distributions as set forth in the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization forthe Utility as confirm
ed by the Bankruptcy Court; and (ii) $60 million in shareholder-funded initiatives undertaken to enhance, among other things, the Utility’slocate and mark compliance an
d capabilities and the reliability of the Underground Service Alert ticket management information that the Utility maintains in theordinary course of its business.
In accordance with the 
settlement agreement, shareholder-funded system enhancements will include, among other things, locate and mark ticket compliance auditsto verify accurate categorization 
of timeliness, compliance audits using field reviews of gas and electric locate and mark tickets to assess performance, procedureadherence and complian
ce, and additional locate and mark staff. The expenditure of any sums not fully expended within three years of the effective date of thesettlement agreement will be s
ubject to further agreement among the parties.199

On January 17, 2020, the presiding officer issued a decision requiring modifications to the settlement agreement that would (i) require an extension of certaincompliance audits requ
ired by the settlement agreement, at a cost to shareholders of $6 million, (ii) an additional fine of $39 million funded by shareholders to bepaid to the General Fund of the Sta
te of California, (iii) certain additional system enhancements, and (iv) requirements on the previously proposed systemenhancements, including a 
requirement that any funds remaining after completion of the system enhancements are not to be spent as agreed to by the parties, but isto be paid to the General Fund. On February 6, 2020, 
the settling parties filed a motion accepting the presiding officer’s proposed modifications to the settlementand proposing alternative 
relief. On February 14, 2020, the presiding officer issued a decision noting that the settling parties had accepted the modificationsincluded in the presiding of
ficer’s decision and rejecting the alternative relief proposed by the settling parties. The deadline for parties to file an appeal of thepresiding officer’s de
cision is February 18, 2020.As of December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $44 million accrual.This proceeding is not subject 
to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connectionwith fines or penalties a
rising out of this proceeding are stayed.OII into Compliance with Ex Parte Communication Rules
On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Uti
lity should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule1.1 of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedur
e governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC. The CPUC would later divide the OII into twophases, pertaining to diff
erent sets of communications.Regarding phase one, on April 26, 2018, the CPUC adopted the se
ttlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC on March 28, 2017, as modified (the“settlement agre
ement”) by the Utility, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, PAO, the SED, and TURN. The decision resulted in a total penalty of $97.5 millioncomprised of: (1) a $12 mi
llion payment to the California General Fund, (2) forgoing collection of $63.5 million of GT&S revenue requirements for the years 2018($31.75 million) and 2019 ($31.75 mil
lion), (3) a $10 million one-time revenue requirement adjustment to be amortized in equivalent annual amounts over theUtility’s next GRC cycle (i.e., th
e 2020 GRC), and (4) compensation payments to the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos in a total amount of $12 million($6 million to each ci
ty).  In addition, the settlement agreement provides for certain non-financial remedies, including enhanced noticing obligations between theUtility and CPUC decision-makers, as wel
l as certification of employee training on the CPUC ex parte communication rules.  Under the terms of the settlementagreement, customers wi
ll bear no costs associated with the financial remedies set forth above.As a result of the CPUC’s April 26, 2018 decision, on May 17, 2018, th
e Utility made a $12 million payment to the California General Fund and $6 millionpayments to each of the Cit
ies of San Bruno and San Carlos. At December 31, 2019, the Utility has refunded $63.5 million of GT&S revenue requirements for theyears 2018 and 2019. In accordance wi
th accounting rules, adjustments related to revenue requirements are recorded in the periods in which they are incurred.Regarding phase two, on December 5, 2019, the CPUC approved a s
ettlement agreement between the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, PAO, the SED, TURN,and the Utility. Under the set
tlement agreement, the Utility will pay a total penalty of $10 million comprised of: (1) a $2 million payment to the California GeneralFund, (2) forgoing collection of $5 
million in revenue requirements during the term of its 2019 GT&S rate case, (3) forgoing collection of $1 million in revenuerequirement during the 
term of its 2020 GRC cycle, and (4) compensation payments to the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos in a total amount of $2 million ($1million to each city
). By the terms of the settlement, the financial remedies will not be implemented until a plan of reorganization is approved in the Chapter 11Cases. In accordance with ac
counting rules, adjustments related to forgone collections would be recorded in the periods in which they are incurred.As of December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $4 million accrual for the amounts payable to theCalifornia General Fund and the Ci
ties of San Bruno and San Carlos.200

Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to RefundThe FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before theFERC has issued a final decision. The Util
ity bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimateof the amounts that are p
robable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, and March 1, 2018, for TO18 and TO19, respectively. Ratessubject to refund for TO20 went into 
effect on May 1, 2019.On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial d
ecision in the TO18 rate case and the Utility filed initial briefs on October 31, 2018, in response to the ALJ’srecommendations. The Util
ity expects the FERC to issue a decision in the TO18 rate case in 2020, however, the timing of that decision is uncertain, and it willlikely be the subject of 
requests for rehearing and appeal.On September 21, 2018, the Utility fi
led an all-party settlement with the FERC, which was approved by FERC on December 20, 2018, in connection with TO19.As part of the settlemen
t, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon issuance of afinal unappealable de
cision in TO18.On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accept
ing the Utility’s October 2018 filing of its TO20 formula rate case, subject to hearings and refund, andestablished May 1, 2019, as the ef
fective date for rate changes.  The FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussionsamong the parties. 
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing or outcome of FERC’s decisions in the TO18 and TO19 proceedings or the timing or outcome of the TO20 proceeding.Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Rights-of-Way
In 2012, the Utility notified 
the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address aself-reported viola
tion whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipelinerights-of-way.  The Utility a
lso submitted a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachmentsover a multi-year pe
riod and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.  In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had beencompleted and that re
mediation work, including removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’sproposed compliance plan, and 
it is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuouslysurvey its system and remove 
encroachments.  The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given theSED’s wide discretion and the number o
f factors that can be considered in determining penalties.Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various claims, lawsuits, and regulatory proceedings that separately are not considered material.  Accruals forcontingencies related to s
uch matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”) totaled$116 million at December 31, 2019 
and were included in LSTC. Accruals for contingencies related to such matters totaled $98 million at December 31, 2018.These amounts were included in Oth
er current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the Petition Date, these amounts were moved to LSTC. PG&ECorporation and the Utility do not b
elieve it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition,results of operations, or c
ash flows.PSPS Class Action
On December 19, 2019, a complaint was f
iled in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California naming PG&E Corporation and theUtility. The plaintiff s
eeks certification of a class consisting of all California residents and business owners who had their power shut off by the Utility during theOctober 9, October 23, October 26, October 28, o
r November 20, 2019 power outages and any subsequent voluntary outages occurring during the course oflitigation. The plaint
iff alleges that the necessity for the October and November 2019 power shutoff events was caused by the Utility's negligence in failing toproperly maintain its 
electrical lines and surrounding vegetation. The complaint seeks up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and exemplarydamages and injunctive r
elief to require the Utility to properly maintain and inspect its power grid.201

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously. On January 21, 2020, PG&E Corporationand the Utility filed a 
motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative strike the class action allegations. The motion to dismiss and strike is set to be heard bythe Bankruptcy Court on March 10, 2020. At this st
age of the litigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate arange of reasonably possible 
losses.2015 GT&S Rate Case Disallowance of Capital Expenditures
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decis
ion in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696million of capital sp
ending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 millionof that amount and ordered 
that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seekrecovery in a future pro
ceeding. Additional charges may be required in the future based on the outcome of the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capitalspending. Capital disallowances 
are reflected in operating and maintenance expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Environmental Remediation Contingencies
Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities req
uires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate thatremediation is probabl
e, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liabilitybased on the lower end of the rang
e of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors thatinform the development of
 estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,post-remediation moni
toring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to theirpresent value. The Utility
’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprisedof the following:

 Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.The Utility’s gas compressor s
tations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage,recycling, and disposal of pot
entially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the EPA under the Federal Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct in addition to other sta
te hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with federal, state, and local laws andregulations related 
to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors theenvironmental requirements o
n an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the DTSC, several California reg
ional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.202

The Utility’s environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2019, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the currentassessment data and regul
atory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plansand the Utility's time frame
 for remediation.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs couldhave a material e
ffect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded. At December 31, 2019,the Utility expected to rec
over $950 million of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by theCPUC. 
Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites
The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gascompressor stations. The Util
ity is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.Topock Site
The Utility’s remedia
tion and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of theInterior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized 
the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic andnon-soluble form of chromiu
m. Construction activities began in October 2018 and will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costsassociated with the Topock sit
e may increase by as much as $208 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. Thecosts associated with environ
mental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recoveredin rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been imple
menting remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and controlmovement of the plume. The Ut
ility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional WaterQuality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In Novemb
er 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up andabatement order directing the 
Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The finalorder states that the Ut
ility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally,the final order sets plu
me capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.The United States Geological Survey 
team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. A draftbackground report is expect
ed to be issued in 2020 and finalized thereafter. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increaseby as much as $128 million if th
e extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmentalremediation at the Hink
ley site will not be recovered through rates.Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce g
as for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this processwere often disposed of at the MGPs the
mselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of thesites in the program have b
een addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $626 million if the extentof contamination or nec
essary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP sites are recovered throughthe HSM, where 90% of the costs are r
ecovered in rates.Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Part
y Disposal SitesUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated withUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $77 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation isgreater than anticipated. The
 environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recoveredthrough the HSM, where 90% of the costs ar
e recovered in rates.203

Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation SitesIn 1998, the Utility divested i
ts generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, theUtility retained the 
environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generationsites may increase by as
 much as $82 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediationcosts associated with the foss
il fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.Insurance
Wildfire Insurance
In 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility r
enewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion forthe period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, co
mprised of $700 million for general wildfire liability in policies covering wildfire and non-wildfire events(subject to an initia
l self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for wildfire property damages only, which included approximately$200 million of coverage th
rough the use of a catastrophe bond. In 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility has liability insurance coverage for wildfire events inan amount of $430 million (subj
ect to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence) for the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020, andapproximately $1 billion
 in liability insurance coverage for non-wildfire events (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence),comprised of $520 million fo
r the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020 and $480 million for the period of September 3, 2019 through September 2,2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to pursue additional insurance coverage. Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layerscould result in uninsured costs 
in the future depending on the amount and type of damages resulting from covered events.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
cost of obtaining the wildfire and non-wildfire insurance coverage in place for the period of August 1, 2019 throughSeptember 2, 2020 is approximat
ely $212 million, compared to the approximately $50 million that the Utility recovered in rates during the year ended December31, 2019. The Utility has sought recovery o
f certain premium costs paid in excess of the amount the Utility currently is recovering from customers through theGRC period ended December 31, 2019. The Utility
’s 2020 GRC settlement agreement includes a new two-way balancing account that would allow the Utility topass through actual insuranc
e premium costs for up to $1.4 billion in coverage. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the 2020 GRCproceeding.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a receivable for insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur.  ThroughDecember 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $1.38 billion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and$843 million for probable insu
rance recoveries in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. These amounts reflect an assumption that the cause ofeach fire is deemed to be a
 separate occurrence under the insurance policies.Nuclear Insurance
The Utility maintains mu
ltiple insurance policies through NEIL, a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities, and European Mutual Association forNuclear Insurance (EMANI), cove
ring nuclear or non-nuclear events at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt BayUnit 3.  
NEIL provides insurance coverag
e for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s twonuclear generating uni
ts at Diablo Canyon. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclear incident and$2.7 billion per non-nuclear 
incident for Diablo Canyon. For Humboldt Bay Unit 3, NEIL provides up to $131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclearproperty damages.
NEIL also provides coverage for d
amages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants. Certain acts of terrorism may be “certified” by the Secretary of theTreasury. If damages ar
e caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL may obtain reimbursement from the federal government up to a shared limit of $3.2 billion foreach insured loss for
 NEIL members. In contrast, for acts of terrorism not deemed “certified” by the Secretary of the Treasury, NEIL treats all non-certifiedterrorist acts occu
rring within a 12-month period against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of theaffected plants would shar
e a $3.2 billion policy limit amount.204

In addition to the nuclear insurance the Utility maintains through the NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the EMANI, which provides excess insurance coveragefor property damages and busin
ess interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. EMANI provides$200 million for any one acc
ident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies.If NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,as of the policy renewal on Apri
l 1, 2020, the maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $44 million.  IfEMANI losses in any policy year exce
ed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $4 million, as of the policyrenewal on April 1, 2020. 
Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation ofmaterial to and fro
m Diablo Canyon are limited to $14.0 billion. The Utility purchased the maximum available public liability insurance of $450 million for DiabloCanyon. The balance of the $14.0 bill
ion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors. The Utility maybe assessed up to $275 million per nu
clear incident under this loss sharing program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of $41 million per incident.Both the maximum assessment 
and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at
 the fuel fabricator’s facility. The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidentsup to a maximum of $450 mill
ion per incident. In addition, the Utility has approximately $53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a$500 million indemnific
ation from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess of the$53 million in liabili
ty insurance.Purchase Commitments

t and satisfaction of certain other conditions. (For more information see “The Bankruptcy Court’s Decision on its Authorityover PG&E Corporation’s and the Utili
ty’s Rejection of Power Purchase Agreements” in Note 2 above.)Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchaseagreements to purchase powe
r and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the currentmarket price of either natural ga
s or electricity at the date of delivery.205

Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreements.  In order to comply with Califo rnia’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to itscustomers at a gradual
ly increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement. TheUtility’s obligations under 
a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expectedto grow.  As of December 31, 2019, renewable en
ergy contracts expire at various dates between 2019 and 2043.Conventional Energy Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, whichinclude tolling agree
ments and resource adequacy agreements.  The Utility’s obligation under a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third parties’development of new generat
ion facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. As of December 31, 2019, these power purchase agreements expireat various dates between 2019 and 2033.
Other Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that owngeneration facili
ties that meet the definition of a QF under federal law. As of December 31, 2019, QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 2019and 2049.  In addition, the Utility h
as agreements with various irrigation districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.The costs incurred for al
l power purchases and electric capacity amounted to $3.0 billion in 2019, $3.1 billion in 2018, and $3.3 billion in 2017.Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments 
The Utility purchases natur
al gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-generation facili
ties.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the US RockyMountain supply area, and the southwes
tern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire atvarious dates between 2019 and 2026.  In add
ition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in northern California to more reliably meetcustomers’ loads.
Costs incurred for natural g
as purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,amounted to $0.9 billion in 2019, $0.6 bil
lion in 2018, and $0.9 billion in 2017.Nuclear Fuel Agreements
The Utility has entered in
to several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2019 and 2024 and are intended toensure long-term nucle
ar fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide securityof supply.  Pricing terms are 
also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices. Payments for nuclear fue
l amounted to $74 million in 2019, $73 million in 2018, and $83 million in 2017.Other Commitments
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have o
ther commitments primarily related to office facilities and land leases, which expire at various dates between 2020 and2052.  At December 31, 2019, the future m
inimum payments related to these commitments were as follows:(in millions)

Payments for other commitments amounted to $48 million in 2019, $43 million in 2018, and $45 million in 2017.  Certain office facility leases contain escalationclauses requiring annual 
increases in rent.  The rents may increase by a fixed amount each year, a percentage of the base rent, or the consumer price index.  Thereare options to extend these 
leases for one  to five years.One of these commitments 
is treated as a financing lease. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, net financing leases reflected in property, plant, and equipment on theConsolidated Balance Sheets were $9 
million and $11 million including accumulated amortization of $9 million and $8 million, respectively.  The present value ofthe future minimum l
ease payments due under these agreements included $2 million and $2 million in Current Liabilities and $7 million and $9 million inNoncurrent Liabilities on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.207

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal controlover financial reporting incl
udes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe transactions and disposi
tions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation o
f financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or
 disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management assessed the e
ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria,management has concluded 
that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independen
t registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2019, b
ased on criteria established in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Com
mission.209

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of PG&E CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation (“Debtor-in-Possession”) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolid
ated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2019, and the rela
ted notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, thefinancial statem
ents present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of itsoperations and its cash flows fo
r each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America (
“GAAP”).We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza
tions of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on theCompany’s internal co
ntrol over financial reporting.Going Concern
The accompanying financi
al statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 1 and 14 to thefinancial statem
ents, the Company suffered material losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire (wildfire-relatedcontingencies are also 
communicated as a critical audit matter below), which contributed to the Company’s decision to voluntarily file for bankruptcy. Thesecircumstances rais
e substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Notes 1and 2. The financial stat
ements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Bankruptcy Proceedings
As discussed in Note 2 to the financi
al statements, on January 29, 2019, the Company has voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying fin
ancial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular,such financial state
ments do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition liabilit
ies, the settlement amounts for allowed claims, or the status and priority thereof; (3) as to shareholder accounts, the effect of any changes that maybe made in the capita
lization of the Company; or (4) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in its business.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.210

Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, takenas a whole, and we are not, by communi
cating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts ordisclosures to which they rel
ate.Wildfire-Related Contingencies — Ref
er to Note 14 to the financial statements (also see going concern explanatory paragraph above)Critical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Company has significant cont
ingencies related to the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and the 2015 Butte fire (the “wildfires”). TheCompany has recorded estima
ted liabilities of $25.5 billion as of December 31, 2019, which is comprised of amounts under agreements with claimholders andrepresents its best est
imate of probable losses as of December 31, 2019. The Company also believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in connectionwith the 2019 Kincade fire but c
annot reasonably estimate the amount or range of such possible loss.We identified wildfire-related conti
ngencies and the related disclosure as a critical audit matter because (1) of the significant judgments made by management toestimate losses and (2) 
the outcome of the wildfire-related contingencies materially affects the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.This required the applic
ation of a high degree of judgment and extensive effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’sestimated losses and di
sclosure related to wildfire-related contingencies.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures
 related to management’s judgment regarding its estimated losses for wildfire- related contingencies and its related disclosure included thefollowing, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over (1) the Company’s determination of whether a loss was probable and/or reasonablypossible; (2) the deter
mination of the significant assumptions, including the information gained through negotiations, settlements, and advice of legalcounsel that may impact the
 valuation of the liability; and (3) the financial statement disclosures related to the wildfires.•
We evaluated management’s judgments related to whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible for the wildfires by inquiring of managementand the Company’s legal counsel 
regarding the amounts of probable and reasonably possible losses, including the potential impact of information gainedthrough negotiations, settl
ements, and advice of legal counsel, and reading settlement agreements and external information for any evidence that mightcontradict managem
ent’s assertions.•
We evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable loss through inquiries with management; we tested the significantassumptions used in the valuat
ion of the liability, including but not limited to newly identified information gained through negotiations, settlements, andadvice of legal counsel; a
nd we compared the recorded liabilities to settlement agreements with claimholders.•
We read the legal letters from the Company’s external and internal legal counsel regarding information from negotiations and settlements, and evaluatedwhether the information 
therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.•
We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.211

Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 14 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas 
& Electric Company, follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover“revenue requiremen
ts” that have been authorized by the California Public Utility Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the“FERC”) based on its cost of providing serv
ice. Pacific Gas & Electric Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process thatwould not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulat
ed entities. Pacific Gas & Electric Company capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that wouldotherwise be charged to expens
e if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.We identified the impact of rate re
gulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impactedaccount balances and disc
losures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of cost recovery and future regulatory orders on the financialstatements. Managemen
t judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates due in part to the uncertainty relatedto approval from the ra
te regulators, (2) a disallowance of costs of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and (3) a refund to customers.Auditing these judgments requi
red specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due its inherent complexities and a highdegree of auditor judgmen
t when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions that the costs approved by a CPUCdecision for tracking purpos
es meet the definition of a regulatory asset under GAAP and are recorded at the appropriate amount.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures rela
ted to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions bythe rate regulators, 
and that the costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are appropriately beingrecorded as a regulato
ry asset included the following, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rateregulation, (2) the eva
luation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment or deferred asregulatory assets; (b) reg
ulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; and (c) arefund or a future reduc
tion in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities; (3) management’s determination that costs approved by a CPUCdecision for tracking purpos
es meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are appropriately being recorded as a regulatory asset and (4) the review offinancial statement disclosures
 related to these matters.•
With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in regulatory accounting, we evaluated the Company’s conclusion that it should apply thespecialized rules to account
 for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.•
We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC for the Company and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings made byintervenors, and other publi
cly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based onprecedence of the CP
UC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’srecorded regulatory ass
et and liability balances for completeness.•
For regulatory matters in process (e.g., applications for cost recovery, regulatory investigations and the CPUC’s review of incurred capital), we inspectedthe Company’s filings with the CPUC and the fi
lings with the CPUC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence thatmight contradict man
agement’s assertions.•
For regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition of aregulatory asset by compa
ring the cost to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were appropriately recorded to the regulatoryasset.
•
We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that has not been approved by the CPUC for recovery or may be disallowed. Weinspected minutes of the Boa
rd of Directors, regulatory orders, and other filings with the regulators to identify any evidence that may contradictmanagement’s assert
ion regarding probability of a disallowance.212

•We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments,were appropriate and consis
tent with the information obtained in our procedures.Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 — Refer to Note 14 to the financial statem
entsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionOn July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed 
into law Assembly Bill (“AB”) 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund (“WildfireFund”) that will be
 available for eligible California electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12,2019 that are caused by the app
licable electric utility company’s equipment. The Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, obtained the U.S.Bankruptcy Court for the Northern Dist
rict of California (“Bankruptcy Court”) approval to participate in the Wildfire Fund and to make any initial and annualWildfire Fund contributions, whi
ch are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $193 million, respectively, upon emergence from Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11 Case”). To pa
rticipate in the Wildfire Fund, Pacific Gas & Electric Company must emerge from its Chapter 11 Case by June 30,2020, along with other eligibil
ity requirements.We identified the Company
’s disclosure of the uncertainties related to the timing of funding (e.g., emergence from the Chapter 11 Case and meeting othereligibility requir
ements), the accounting for any contributions made to the Wildfire Fund, and other material information included in AB 1054, as a critical auditmatter because of th
e significant judgments made by management to determine the extent of the disclosure, including its accounting conclusion related to the initialand annual contributions, as th
ere is no relevant explicit guidance for accounting for contributions to a statewide fund and thus accounting guidance must beapplied analogously. This requi
red the application of a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate thereasonableness of manage
ment’s judgments.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures rela
ted to the disclosures of the uncertainties associated with the timing of funding, material information included in AB 1054, and theaccounting for contribut
ions included the following, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of financial statement disclosures of the uncertainties associated with the timing of the funding,material inform
ation included in AB 1054, and the accounting for contributions.•
With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in insurance accounting, we evaluated management’s judgments related to itsdetermination of the 
accounting for any contributions made to the Wildfire Fund.•
We read the terms of the AB 1054 legislation and the Company’s accounting analysis and evaluated any clauses that contradicted the Company’sconclusions about the account
ing for contributions or the financial statement disclosures.•
We evaluated whether the financial statement disclosures were complete and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures./s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Pacific Gas and Electric CompanyOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“Debtor-in-Possession”) and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) asof December 31, 2019 and 2018, the rel
ated consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the threeyears in the period ended Dec
ember 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financialstatements”). In our opin
ion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Utility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,and the results of its oper
ations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the 
United States of America.We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Utility's internal controlover financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Utility's internal controlover financial reporting.
Going Concern
The accompanying financi
al statements have been prepared assuming that the Utility will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 1 and 14 to thefinancial statem
ents, the Utility suffered material losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to theUtility’s decision to volunt
arily file for bankruptcy. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management'splans in regard to these m
atters are also described in Notes 1 and 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome ofthis uncertainty.
Bankruptcy Proceedings
As discussed in Note 2 to the financi
al statements, on January 29, 2019, the Company has voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying fin
ancial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular,such financial state
ments do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition liabilit
ies, the settlement amounts for allowed claims, or the status and priority thereof; (3) as to shareholder accounts, the effect of any changes that maybe made in the capita
lization of the Company; or (4) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in its business.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Utility’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Utility’s financial statements basedon our audits. We are a publi
c accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance with theU.S. federal securities l
aws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion./s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

erred StockThe rights of holders of Common Stock m
ay be materially limited or qualified by the rights of holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.Set forth below is a descript
ion of PG&E Corporation’s authority to issue preferred stock and the possible terms of that stock.Our Board of Directors is authori
zed, pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, to issue up to 85,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more seriesand to fix and determine 
the number of shares of preferred stock of any series, to determine the designation of any such series, to increase or decrease the numberof shares of any such series subsequ
ent to the issue of shares of that series, and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to orimposed upon any such series.
Prior to the issuance of shar
es of each series of our preferred stock, our Board of Directors is required to adopt resolutions and file a certificate ofdetermination with the Se
cretary of State of the State of California. The certificate of determination will fix for each series the designation and number of sharesand the rights, preferen
ces, privileges and restrictions of the shares including, but not limited to, the following:•
the title and stated value of the preferred stock;•
voting rights, if any, of the preferred stock;•
any rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions);•
the dividend rate(s), period(s) and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation applicable to the preferred stock;•
whether dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on the preferred stock will accumulate;•
the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;•
the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred stock will be convertible into our Common Stock, including the conversion price (ormanner of calculat
ion) and conversion period;•
the provision for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred stock;•
the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, for the preferred stock;•
liquidation preferences;•
any limitations on issuance of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the class or series of preferred stock as todividend rights and rights upon liqu
idation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; and•
any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock.
All shares of preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable and will not have any preemptive or similar rights.In addition to the terms 
listed above, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following terms relating to the class or series of preferred stockbeing offered:
•
the number of shares of preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock;•
the procedures for any auction and remarketing, if any, for the preferred stock;•
any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and•
a discussion of any material and/or special United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock.Until our Board of Directors det
ermines the rights of the holders of a series of preferred stock, we cannot predict the effect of the issuance of any shares ofsuch series of preferr
ed stock upon the rights of holders of our Common Stock. However, the effect could include one or more of the following:•
restricting dividends on our Common Stock;•
diluting the voting power of our Common Stock;•
impairing the liquidation rights of our Common Stock; or•
delaying or preventing a change in control of us without further action by our shareholders.Our preferred stock, if issu
ed, would rank, with respect to dividends and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up:•
senior to all classes or series of our Common Stock and to all of our equity securities ranking junior to the preferred stock;•
on a parity with all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank on a parity with the preferred stock; and•
junior to all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank senior to the preferred stock.Holding Company Structure
PG&E Corporation conducts its operat
ions primarily through its subsidiaries and substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries,including Pacific Gas and Ele
ctric Company (the “Utility”). Accordingly, PG&E Corporation’s cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largelydependent upon the earnings of i
ts subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of these earnings to PG&E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans oradvances and repayment of 
loans and advances. PG&E Corporation’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amountsor make any funds availabl
e for payment pursuant to PG&E Corporation’s obligations.Because PG&E Corporation is a holding comp
any, its obligations will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries,including all debt secur
ities and issued and outstanding preferred stock of the Utility (see Exhibit 4.33(b) for a description of such preferred stock). Furthermore,the rights of PG&E Corporation to par
ticipate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or reorganization of the subsidiary will be subject to the priorclaims of such subsidiary’s 
creditors, including any holders of preferred stock of such subsidiary. To the extent that PG&E Corporation is itself a creditor withrecognized claims ag
ainst any of its
subsidiaries, its claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interest in, or mortgages or other liens on, the assets of the subsidiary and would besubordinated to any indebtedness o
r other liabilities of the subsidiary that are senior to the claims held by PG&E Corporation.

The

Claim ”) against the  Debtors arising out of the wildfires listed in Schedule 1  (the “ Wildfires ”). The Debtors have reviewed the Claim, determined it 
to be compensable in the amount of $[____], and offered to settle it at this amount (the “Claim Amount ”). By
 returning this signed Release to the Debtors, the Releasor is agreeing to accept the Debtors’ offer to fully settle the Claim at the Claim Amount, andagreeing
 that the payment of the Claim Amount constitutes payment in full on the Claim and fully satisfies the Releasor’s losses resulting or arising from theWildfires.
In
 consideration for the agreements described in this Release and other good and valuable consideration, and because the Debtors are able to pay and areactually paying
 the Claim Amount in full, Releasor, on his, her, or its own behalf and on behalf of the Releasor’s heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns,hereby
 waives and fully releases Releasor’s insurance carriers and past and present holders of insurance subrogation claims against the Debtors (and their directand
 indirect  assignors),  and each  of their  directors,  officers,  agents,  consultants,  financial  advisors,  employees,  attorneys,  predecessors,  successors  and  assigns(collectively

e against any Releasee other than the Releasor’s foregoing release of made-whole claims.Releasor
 agrees that each Releasee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Release and may enforce this Release and any rights or remedies set forthherein.
 Further, Releasor understands that the order confirming the Debtors’ plan of reorganization shall deem each holder of a subrogation claim that is a thirdparty beneficiary of 
this release to have released Releasor from any claim to Releasor’s recovery from the Debtors on account of the Claim.TO

 shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant using the “Cashless Exercise” method describedbelow to pay the aggregate ex
ercise price and tax withholdings.Vesting of Stock Option
As  long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the one-third of each of the Tranche 1 Options, Tranche 2Options
 and Tranche  3 Options will vest upon, and to the extent of, the Committee’s  certification  of the extent  towhich
 the performance goals have been attained for this award on each of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020and
 December  31,  2021  (each,  a  “Vesting  Date”),  which  certification  will  occur  on  or  after  January  1  but  beforeMarch 15 of the year following each Vesting Date. Except as described below, all Options that have not vested will be
cancelled upon termin
ation of your employment.
Performance GoalsFor  the  December  31,  2019  Vesting  Date,  the  number  of  Options  you  are  entitled  to  exercise  will  be  calculated  bymultiplying the number of v
ested Options by the “payout percentage” determined as follows (except as set forth elsewherein this Agreement), rounded to 
the nearest whole number:The
 Options have safety-based, financial-based  and customer-based performance goals and a resulting payoutpercentage
 based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals. The Options’ performance goals willbe
 a modification of the 2019 STIP performance goals as described and approved in an order of the BankruptcyCourt
 dated April 29, 2019. The Options’ performance goals are set forth on Exhibit A, as measured over theperiod April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, sub
ject to adjustment as set forth below.Achievement
 of  the  Options’  performance  goals  will  be  certified  by  the  Committee.  Subject  to  roundingconsiderations,
 if  performance  is  below  threshold,  the  payout  percentage  will  be  0%;  if  performance  is  atthreshold,
 the payout percentage will be 50%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%;and
 if  performance  is  at  or  better  than  maximum,  the  payout  percentage  will  be  150%.  The  actual  payoutpercentage
 for performance between threshold and maximum will be determined based on linear interpolationbetween
 the  payout  percentages  for  threshold  and  target,  or  target  and  maximum,  as  appropriate.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the aggregate score for the public safety index metric set forth on Exhibit A isbelow
 threshold  level,  then  the  payout  percentage  will  be  reduced  by  50%  and  if  the  aggregate  score  for  thepublic
 safety index metric set forth on Exhibit A is at or above threshold level but below target level, then thepayout
 percentage will be reduced by 25%. The final score will be determined in the discretion of the PG&ECorporation Board of Directors or 
its delegate, including any decision to reduce or forego payment entirely.For
 the December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 Vesting Dates, the applicable performance goals will be determinedby the Committee in its good f
aith discretion.The
 final payout percentage, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee or anequivalent
 body certifies the extent to which the performance goals have been attained, pursuant to Section 10.5(a) of theLTIP.
Dividends
Options do not have tandem dividend equ ivalents and do not accrue dividend equivalents.Voluntary Termination
In the event of your voluntary termination, all unvested Options will be cancelled on the date of termination. VestedOptions may be exercised for 
the remaining Term of the Options.Termination for Cause
If  your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause, all vested andunvested
 Options will be cancelled immediately. In general, termination for “cause” means termination of employmentbecause
 of dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretionof PG&E Corporation.
Termination other than for Cause

ed for the remaining Term of the Options.
Death/DisabilityIf  your employment terminates due to your death or Disability, all of your Options will continue to vest and becomeexercisable

 goals have been attained (without regard to the requirement that you be employed). Vested Options maybe
 exercised within one year after the applicable Vesting Date or the remaining Term of the Options, whichever isshorter.
Change in Control
In  the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other businessentity
 or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror” ), may, without your consent, either assume or continuePG&E
 Corporation’s  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  provide  a  substantially  equivalent  award  insubstitution for the Options subje
ct to this Agreement.If the
 Acquiror assumes or continues PG&E Corporation’s rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes asubstantially
 equivalent award, Options will vest on the applicable Vesting Date, and the performance goals will bedeemed to have been achi
eved at target, resulting in a payout percentage of 100%.If
 the  Options  are  neither  so  assumed  nor  so  continued  by  the  Acquiror,  and  the  Acquiror  does  not  provide  asubstantially
 equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  the  Options,  all  of  your  unvested  Options  will  vest  and  theperformance
 goals will be deemed to have been achieved at target, resulting in a payout percentage of 100%. SuchOptions
 will be cancelled for fair value (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion in good faith) which, ifso determined by the Committee, will equal the excess, if any, of value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in
Control
 transaction, directly or indirectly, to holders of the same number and class of shares of Stock subject to suchunvested Options over the aggrega
te exercise price of such unvested Options.Termination In Connection with a
Change in Control (if Acquiror
assumes, continues, or substitutes the
awards)
If your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause or your voluntary termination) in connection with aChange
 in  Control  within  three  months  before  the  Change  in  Control  occurs,  all  of  your  outstanding  Options(including
 Options that you would have otherwise forfeited after such termination) will vest on the date of the Changein
 Control and the performance goals will be deemed to have been achieved at target, resulting in a payout percentageof
 100%. Vested Options may be exercised within one year after the Change in Control or the remaining Term of theOptions, whichever is shorter.
In
 the  event  your  employment  is  terminated  (other  than  termination  for  cause  or  your  voluntary  termination)  inconnection
 with a Change in Control within two years following the Change in Control, your Options (to the extentthey
 did not previously vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) will vest onthe
 date of such termination and the performance goals will be deemed to have been achieved at target, resulting in apayout
 percentage of 100%. Vested Options may be exercised within one year after the termination or the remainingterm of the Options, whichever 
is shorter.PG&E
 Corporation  has  the  sole  discretion  to  determine  whether  termination  of  your  employment  was  made  inconnection with a Change in Control.

 Performance  Shares  will  be  settled  in  shares  of  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  ofWithholding

the nearest whole number.The
 Performance  Shares  have  financial-based  performance  goals  and  a  resulting  payout  percentage  based  on  theachievement of the app

 and maximum will be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold andtarget,
 or target and maximum, as appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate score for the public safetyindex
 metric set forth on Exhibit A is below threshold level, then the payout percentage will be reduced by 50% and if theaggregate score for th

Grant of
Performance Shares
PG&E Corporation grants you the number of Performance Shares shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement (the“Performance Shares”). Th
e Performance Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.Vesting of Performance Shares
Settlement in Shares/
Performance Goals
As long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the Performance Shares will vest upon, and to the extent of, theCommittee’s
 certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award as of December 31,2019
 (the “Vesting Date”), which certification will occur on or after January 1, 2020 but before March 15, 2020. Except asdescribed below, all Perfor
mance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of your employment.Vested
 Performance  Shares  will  be  settled  in  shares  of  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  ofWithholding
 Taxes, as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplyingthe
 number of vested Performance Shares by the “payout percentage” determined as follows (except as set forth elsewherein this Agreement), rounded to 
the nearest whole number.The
 Performance Shares have safety-based performance goals and a resulting payout percentage based on the achievementof
 the  applicable  performance  goals  as  measured  over  the  period  July  1,  2019  through  December  31,  2019.  ThePerformance
 Shares’ performance goals will be a modification of the 2019 STIP safety performance goals as described andapproved
 in an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated April 29, 2019. The Performance Shares’ performance goals are setforth on Exhibit A, subject to adjus
tment as set forth below.Achievement
 of  the  Performance  Shares’  performance  goals  will  be  certified  by  the  Committee.  Subject  to  roundingconsiderations,
 if performance  is below threshold,  the payout percentage  will be 0%; if performance  is at threshold,  thepayout
 percentage will be 50%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if performance is at orbetter
 than  maximum,  the  payout  percentage  will  be  150%.  The  actual  payout  percentage  for  performance  betweenthreshold
 and maximum will be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold andtarget,
 or target and maximum, as appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate score for the public safetyindex
 metric set forth on Exhibit A is below threshold level, then the payout percentage will be reduced by 50% and if theaggregate score for th
e public safety index metric set forth on Exhibit A is at or above threshold level but below target level,then
 the  payout  percentage  will  be  reduced  by  25%.  The  final  score  will  be  determined  in  the  discretion  of  the  PG&ECorporation Board of Directors or 
its delegate, including any decision to reduce or forego payment entirely.
The final payout percentage, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee or anequivalent body certif
ies the extent to which the performance goals have been attained, pursuant to Section 10.5(a) of theLTIP. PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as p
racticable after such determination, but no earlier than the VestingDate, and not later than Ma
rch 15 of the calendar year following the Vesting Date.Dividends
Each time that PG&E Corporation d eclares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividendmultiplied by the number o
f Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf. If youreceive a Performance Share 
settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receivea cash payment equal to th
e amount of any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by thesame payout percentage us
ed to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.Voluntary Termination
If you terminate your e mployment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date, all of the PerformanceShares will be cancelled 
as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your PerformanceShares will be forfeited.

If your employment with PG&E Corporat ion is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause before the VestingDate, all of the Perform
ance Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued withrespect to your Performan
ce Shares will be forfeited. In general, termination for “cause” means termination of employmentbecause of dishonesty, a cri
minal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretionof PG&E Corporation. For the avoidance of doub
t, you will not be eligible to retire if your employment is being or isterminated for cause.

 Vesting  Date  that  you  were  employed  by  PG&E  (rounded  down)  divided  by  five  (5).  All  other  outstandingPerformance

Performance
 Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled toreceive, if any.

t and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15of the year following the Vest

 parent  thereof,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  “Acquiror” ),  may,  without  your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  PG&ECorporation’s rights and obliga
tions under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for thePerformance Shares subjec
t to this Agreement.If
 the  Acquiror  assumes  or  continues  PG&E  Corporation’s  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  substitutes  asubstantially
 equivalent  award,  Performance  Shares  will  vest  on  the  Vesting  Date,  and  the  performance  goals  will  bedeemed
 to  have  been  achieved  at  target,  resulting  in  a  payout  percentage  of  100%.  Settlement  will  occur  as  soon  aspracticable
 after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following the Vesting Date. At that time you alsowill receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares from
the date of grant through th
e Vesting Date multiplied by a payout percentage of 100%.If
 the Change in Control of PG&E Corporation occurs before the Vesting Date, and if this award is neither so assumed norso

 Shares  subject  to  this  Agreement,  all  of  your  outstanding  Performance  Shares  will  vest  and  becomenonforfeitable
 on the date of the Change in Control. Such vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon aspracticable
 following the original Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following the Vesting Date. Theperformance goals will b
e deemed to have been achieved at target and the payout percentage will be 100%. At that time youalso

l multiplied by a payout percentage of 100%.Termination In Connection with

 years  following  the  Change  in  Control,  all  of  your  outstanding  Performance  Shares  (to  the  extent  they  did  notpreviously
 vest upon failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) will vest and become nonforfeitable on thedate of termination o
f your employment.If your employment is te
rminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control withinthree
 months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest in full and becomenonforfeitable
 (including the portion that you would have otherwise forfeited based on the proration of vested PerformanceShares through the date of te
rmination of your employment) as of the date of the Change in Control.Your
 vested Performance Shares, if any, will be settled as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date but nolater
 than March 15 of the year following the Vesting Date, based on the payout percentage (which in this case will bedeemed
 to be at target, consistent with the “Change in Control” section, above). At that time you also will receive a cashpayment,
 if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued from the date of grant through the Vesting Date with respect toyour
 vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you areentitled
