ng government and commercial satellites and space exploration.BDS'
 primary  customer  is  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  salesthrough
 the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately  84%  of  its  2021  revenues.  Other  significant  BDS  customers  include  the  NationalAeronautics and Space Administratio
n (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.This
 segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46ATanker and T-7A Red Hawk. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 C
hinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.Unmanned
 vehicles  include  the  MQ-25,  QF-16  and  Insitu’s  Scan  Eagle  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment's  products  include  space  and  missilesystems including: government and
 commercial satellites, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), the International Space Station, Commercial Crew,missile defense and weapons pro
grams and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture.1

Table of Contents Global Services Segment
This
 segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a fullspectrum
 of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades andconversions,
 spare  parts,  pilot  and  maintenance  training  systems  and  services,  technical  and  maintenance  documents,  and  data  analytics  anddigital services.
Boeing Capital Segment
BCC
 seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product, while managing overallfinancing
 exposure. BCC’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assetsheld for sale or re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Human Capital
The
 COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health andsafety
 of our employees  and maintain  business continuity.  As COVID-19  vaccines  became available, we strongly  encouraged employees  to getvaccinated
 when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees getvaccinated,
 offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. Weprovided
 access to virtual primary care physicians at no cost. We expanded our virtual work options and many of our office workers continue totelecommute.
 We have maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, physical distance requirements and enhanced cleaningrequirements.
 We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposureto
 COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results directly to our Health Services group. As part of that reporting process, we have a robust contacttracing program
 to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of theactions
 above  are  overseen  by  Boeing’s  Crisis  Management  Working  Group,  a  multi-functional,  multi-discipline  team  tasked  with  integrating  allaspects of Boeing’s COVID-19 response.
As of December 31, 2021, Boeing’s total workforce was approx
imately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.2

Table of Contents As of December 31,
 2021, our workforce is composed of approximately 47,000 union members. Our principal collective bargaining agreements werewith the following unions:

 included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across alllevels
 of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. In June of 2021, we released ourfirst
 Global  Equity,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  report  with  our  workforce  composition.  As  of  December  2020,  our  U.S.  workforce  was  comprised  ofapproximat
ely 23% women, 31% racial and ethnic minorities and 15% veterans. We also support Business Resource Groups open to all employeeswith
 more  than  13,000  participants  across  150  chapters  globally  that  focus  on  gender,  race  &  ethnicity,  generations,  gender  identity,  sexualorientation,
 disability  or  veteran  status.  These  groups  help  foster  inclusion  among  all  teammates,  build  awareness,  recruit  and  retain  a  diverseworkforce
 and  support  the  company  in  successfully  operating  in  a  global,  multicultural  business  environment.  We  are  committed  to  releasing  aGlobal Equity, Diversity and Inclusion report in 20
22 which will be updated with 2021 information. Our 2021 report can be found on our website.To
 attract and retain the best-qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off,parental
 leave, retirement benefits, tuition assistance, employee skills development, leadership development and rotation programs. In 2021, ourvoluntary
 resignation rate was approximately 4%. Additionally, we hired approximately 9,800 new employees in 2021 for critical skills and had anoffer acceptance rate of 83%.
Employees
 are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through ongoing employee engagement activities. Boeing actively listens toits employees via surveys ranging 
from pre-hire to exiting the company. These voluntary surveys provide aggregate trend reports for the company toaddress in
 real time and ensure Boeing maintains an employee-focused experience and culture. We also invest in rewarding performance and haveestablished a multi-level recogniti
on program for the purpose of acknowledging the achievements of excellent individual or team performance.We
 are committed to supporting our employees’ continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through access to digitallearning
 resources  and  through  partnerships  with  leading  professional/technical  societies  and  organizations  around  the  world.  For  2021,  Boeingemployees
 consumed  approximately  3.6  million  hours  of  learning.  We  offer  the  ability  for  our  people  to  pursue  degree  programs,  professionalcertificates
 and individual courses in strategic fields of study from more than 300 accredited colleges and universities, online and across the globethrough our tuition assistance program. Over 10,000 Boeing emp
loyees leverage these programs every year.3

Table of Contents Safety,
 quality, integrity and sustainability are at the core of how Boeing operates. We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe,open
 and accountable  work environment  for  our employees.  We provide several channels for  all employees  to speak up, ask for  guidance andreport concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns a
nd take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.Competition
The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  ourprocesses
 and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers withhigher quality products.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonTechnologies
 Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue tobuild
 a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. Inaddition,
 certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects thetrend of strong competition to continue into 2022.
The
 commercial  and  defense  services  markets  are  extremely  challenging  and  are  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering productsand
 services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance andengine
ering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitivein 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveragin
g a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to,  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts.
 The  U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment
 contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted andcould require us to pay the difference between the orig
inal contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted fromthe original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us li
able for damages resulting from the default.Commercial
 Aircraft. In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness  and  installation  approvals,  repair  procedures  and  continuing  operational  safety.  New  aircraft  models  and  new  derivativeaircraft
 are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into service. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installationand operational approvals. Thes
e requirements are generally4

Table of Contents administered
 by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Aviation SafetyAgency.
Environmental.
 We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge,
 treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  could  also  be  affected  by  future  laws  andregulations
 relating to climate change, including laws related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increasedenvironmental
 compliance  expenditures,  increased  energy  and  raw  materials  costs  and  new  and/or  additional  investment  in  designs  andtechnologies.
 We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliancewith
 all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Investigation,  remediation  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  associated  withenvironmental
 compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under ourcontracts
 with  the  U.S.  government.  It  is  reasonably  possible  that  costs  incurred  to  ensure  continued  environmental  compliance  could  have  amaterial
 impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standardsare
 imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted bythe results of investigations.
A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities, former facilities or third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for whichwe
 were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additionalinformation relating to environmental conting
encies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S.
 Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,including
 regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.sales are also subject to varying currency, political an
d economic risks.Raw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe
 sources  could take a year or more.  Many major  components and product  equipment  items  are procured  or subcontracted  on a sole-sourcebasis.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, qualitystandards
 and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system tocontrol
 risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affectproduction
 schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  alsodependent on the availab
ility of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.5

Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors
An
 investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materiallyfrom
 our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the informationcontained in this report.
Risks Related to COVID-19
We
 face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had, andwill
 continue  to  have,  significant  effects  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  We  also  facesignificant
 risks related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic. Theserisks
 include materially reduced demand for our products and services, increased instability in our operations and in our supply chainand
 challenges  to  the  ongoing  viability  of  some  of  our  customers.  In  addition,  future  vaccination  mandates  or  other  governmentrequirement
s may further disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. We may face similar risks in connection withany future public health crises, including resurgences in the spread of COVID-19.
The
 COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, financial performance, cash flows and financial condition to a number of risks,including, but not limited to those discussed b
elow.Operations-related
 risks: As  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  are  facing  increased  operational  challenges  from  the  need  to  protectemployee
 health and safety. These challenges have included, and may in the future include, production site shutdowns, workplace disruptions andrestrictions
 on  the  movement  of  people,  social  distancing  guidelines,  increased  employee  absenteeism  due  to  illness  and/or  quarantine/contacttracing requirements, as well as reduced availa
bility of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and those of our customers and suppliers.During
 the second quarter of 2020, we temporarily suspended operations in Puget Sound, South Carolina, and Philadelphia, as well as at severalother
 key production sites. We had not previously experienced a complete suspension of our operations at these production sites. While we haveresumed
 operations at all of our production sites, we cannot predict whether or where further production disruptions could be required or what theongoing
 impact of COVID-19-related operating restrictions will be. For example, we continue to experience near-term production disruptions andinefficiencies
 as  well  as  additional  operating  costs  due  to  social  distancing  requirements,  increased  levels  of  employee  absenteeism  and  otherfactors
 related to COVID-19 restrictions. We cannot predict the impact that future production disruptions may have on our business, operations,financial
 performance and financial condition. We continue to monitor federal, state and municipal health authorities for new or modified guidanceand
 requirements  concerning  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  we  may  be  required  to  impose  additional  operational  restrictions  and/or  suspendoperations
 at key production sites based on these requirements and recommendations and/or workplace disruptions caused by COVID-19. If futurevaccination
 mandates or other similar governmental requirements take effect, or if COVID-19 case rates worsen at one or more of our productionfacilities,
 we may face further increases in employee absenteeism and/or attrition, any of which could cause operational disruptions and otherwisehave an adverse effect on our business and results of operatio
ns.Many
 of our suppliers also were required to suspend operations during the second quarter of 2020. In 2021, we experienced part shortages whichdisrupted
 our operations  and delayed deliveries.  We may experience  additional disruptions  and/or  part  shortages  in 2022. Any such disruptionscould have severe adverse impacts on our productio
n costs, delivery schedule and/or ability to meet customer commitments.7

Table of Contents Further
 production disruptions and inefficiencies, suspension of operations or delayed recovery in our operations, and/or any comparable impactsinvolving
 one or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, which couldhave a further material adverse effect on our business, financial positi
on, results of operations and/or cash flows.Liquidity
 risks: The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  our  liquidity  and  overall  debt  levels.  During  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2billion.
 Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operatingcash flows in future quarters
 until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currentlycontemplate,
 we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. If we were to need to obtain additionalfinancing,
 uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to ourcredit
 rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition,certain of
 our customers may also be unable to make timely payments to us. Factors that could limit our access to additional liquidity include furtherdisruptions
 in the global capital markets and/or additional declines in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any orall
 of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments.In
 addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position andaccess to capital markets, and a significant downgrade co
uld have an adverse impact on our businesses.Customer-related risks:
 Commercial  air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted passenger trafficmost
 severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could  implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  alsoimplement
ing significant reductions in staffing. These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to ourcustomers’
 revenue, earnings, and cash flow, and in some cases may threaten the future viability of some of our customers, potentially causingdefaults
 within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft that havealready
 been produced and/or are currently in backlog. If we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body
 markets do not recover as soon as we are currently assuming, or if we are required to further reduce production rates and/or contract theaccounting
 quantity on any of our commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize areach-forward
 loss on one or more of our programs. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a reach-forward loss on the 777Xprogram
 in part due to impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellationsacross all of
 our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand. Our customers may alsolack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.
In
 addition  to  the  near-term  impact,  there  is  risk  that  the  industry  implements  longer-term  strategies  involving  reduced  capacity,  shifting  routepatterns
 and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experiencereduced demand due to reluctance by the flying p
ublic to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.As
 a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19
 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial aircraft, as well asfor
 the services we provide to commercial airlines. In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would putadditional
 pressure  on  our  suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.  To  the  extent  that  theCOVID-19 pandemic
8

Table of Contents or its aftermath further impacts demand for our
 products and services or impairs the viability of some of our customers and/or suppliers, our financialposition, results of operations and/or cash flows could b
e adversely affected, and those impacts could be material.Other
 risks: The  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  uncertain  and  continues  to  adversely  affect  our  business  andoperating
 and financial results. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2020, due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on ourearnings,
 we  recorded  an  increase  of  $2.5  billion  to  the  valuation  allowance  associated  with  deferred  income  tax  assets.  The  pandemic  also  isexpected
 to  heighten  many  of  the  other  risks  described  below.  For  example,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  could  cause  and  continue  to  cause  anincreasingly
 competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base. Further, the COVID-19
 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect topresent significant risks to our operations or financial results.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
We
 remain subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX. These risks include uncertainties regarding the timingand
 conditions  of  remaining  737  MAX  regulatory  approvals,  lower  than  planned  production  rates  and/or  delivery  rates,  additionalconsiderations
 to customers, increased supplier costs and supply chain health, changes to the assumptions and estimates made in ourfinancial
 statements  regarding  the  737  program  and  potential  outcomes  of  737  MAX-related  legal  proceedings  and  governmentinvestigations that remain outstanding.
On
 March 13, 2019, the FAA issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following twofatal
 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended untilDecember 2020. The
 grounding reduced revenues, operating margins and cash flows, and will continue to do so until production rates return to pre-grounding levels. While we hav
e received regulatory approval to return the 737 MAX to service in most jurisdictions, we continue to work with certainnon-U.S.
 civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide. Any delays in thecompletion
 of the certification activities and/or the ramp-up of deliveries or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial positi
on, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against usrelated
 to the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including anongoing
 investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also remain subject to compliance with a Deferred Prosecution Agreementwith
 the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the Department of Justice’s investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane bythe FAA. We expensed $744 million in 
the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. Any further adverse impacts related to any such litigationor investigations could have a further material impact on our financ
ial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.During
 2019, we announced plans to reduce, and ultimately to suspend 737 production. Impacts related to our suspension of 737 MAX productionfrom
 2019 to 2020 significantly increased costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and have resulted in reduced 737program
 and  overall  BCA  segment  operating  margins.  We  have  also  made  significant  assumptions  regarding  estimated  costs  expected  to  beincurred
 in  2022  that  should  be  included  in  program  inventory  and  those  estimated  costs  that  will  be  expensed  when  incurred  as  abnormalproduction
 costs. If the completion of remaining certification activities and/or our ability to deliver 737 aircraft to customers is impaired, we will incursignificant
 additional  costs  and/or  be  required  to  delay  the  planned  ramp-up  of  737  production.  These  delays  would  also  result  in  significantadditional disruption to the 737 pro
duction system and9

Table of Contents further
 delay  efforts  to  restore  and/or  implement  previously  planned  increases  in  the  737  production  rate.  Cash  flows  continue  to  be  negativelyimpacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costs and inventory levels, an
d payments made to customers in connection with disruption totheir
 operations. In addition, we have experienced claims and assertions from customers in connection with the grounding and associated deliverydelays,
 and recorded an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for these disruptions. As of December 31, 2021,the
 remaining  liability  associated  with  these  concessions  and  other  considerations  totaled  $2.9  billion,  of  which  $0.7  billion  remains  subject  tonegotiation.
Any
 further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or the long-term health ofthe
 production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated  concessions  or  other  considerations  we  expect  to  provide  tocustomers
 could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows.  In  the  event  of  unanticipatedadditional
 training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one ormore
 customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our  production  plans,  employmentreductions and/or the expenditure of significa
nt resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.We
 have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period during which thoseunits
 are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routinewarranty
 costs. We have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing of future 737productio
n rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply chain health as we implement our production plans, as well as outcomesof
 negotiations with customers. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impacton our financial position, results of operations a
nd/or cash flows.In
 addition to the impact of COVID-19 described above, our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily oncommercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.
Market
 conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  ispredominantly
 driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  aresustained
 economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influencedby
 airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price andother
 competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical andvery
 competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in theglobal
 economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer neworders
 for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could resultin
 lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our  commercial  aircraft  backlogconsists
 of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  couldunexpectedly affect deliveries over a long p
eriod.We
 enter  into  firm  fixed-price  aircraft  sales  contracts  with  indexed  price  escalation  clauses,  which  could  subject  us  to  losses  if  we  have  costoverruns
 or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial  aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years beforethe
 aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generallyconsists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas
10

Table of Contents derived
 from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalationformulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalati
on factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes inescalation amounts can significantly imp
act revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.We
 derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial  Airplanes  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  a  healthy  production  system,  ensure  every  airplane  in  ourproduction
 system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft ornew derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements, including the risk of evolving standards forcommercial
 aircraft certification, and performance and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as theimplementation
 of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing theprocess
 for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. Tothe
 extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs toachieve
 compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associatedwith
 meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the groundingof the 737 MAX
 and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation authorities around the globe. 737 MAXdeliveries
 resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, weexperienced
 production  quality  issues,  including  in  our  supply  chain,  which  have  contributed  to  lower  787  deliveries,  including  a  pause  in  787deliveries
 since  May  2021.  During  2021,  this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  toconduct inspections and rework on und
elivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resumingdelivery.
 A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individualairplane deliveries if the actual de
livery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. The regulators will ultimately determine the timingand
 conditions  for  resuming  787  deliveries.  Delays  on  the  737  MAX,  777X  and  787  programs  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.
We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operatio
nal stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meetcustomer
 demand  and  maintain  our  profitability. We  have  previously  announced  plans  to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercialaircraft
 programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework  on  undelivered  787  aircraft.  The  787program
 is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changesin
 the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. Inaddition,
 we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs,identifying and implementing pro
ductivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any11

Table of Contents of
 our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timelydeliver
 components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financialperformance of one or more of our programs may suffer.
Operational
 challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delaysand/or
 failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins. Our commercial
 aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meetinternal
 performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  approval,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  andincreased
 production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet supportcosts.
 For example, in 2021, we performed additional inspections and associated rework on 787 aircraft in inventory and continued discussions withthe FAA regarding required actions to resume deliv
eries, resulting in additional costs and further delays in aircraft deliveries to customers.If our
 commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We derive a substantial portion of
 our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S.defense
 spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threatenvironme
nt, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of theU.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as auth
orization and appropriations bills.The
 timeliness of FY22 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations forgovernment
 departments  or  agencies  would  result  in  a  full  or  partial  government  shutdown,  which  could  impact  the  Company’s  operations.Alternatively,
 Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict theexecution
 of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overalllevels
 of  defense  spending  in  FY22  and  beyond,  and  it  is  likely  that  U.S.  government  discretionary  spending,  including  defense  spending,  willcontinue to be subject to pressure.
There
 continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  future  acquisition  priorities  and  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  othergovernment
 agencies  (including  NASA),  including  changes  to  national  security  and  defense  priorities,  and  tension  between  modernizationinvestments,
 sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or budgetcuts,
 including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays ofexisting
 contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’sfinancial position, results of operations an
d/or cash flows.In
 addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending and the evolving nature of the nationalsecurity
 threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation, cybersecurity and delivery of technicaldata and

 in its  procurement  processes.  If  we can no longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing acquisition  policies,  our  revenues  and marketshare
 could be impacted. Also, additional federal appropriations to cover the increased costs of federal contractors’ compliance with evolving U.S.Government contractual requirements associated with COVID-19 mitigatio
n are unlikely, reducing the U.S. Government’s buying power.Our
 ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financialstability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and o
ther components.We
 rely  on  other  companies,  including  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  subcontractors  and  suppliers,  to  provide  and  produce  raw  materials,  integratedcomponents and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to
 perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or moreof
 our  suppliers  or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meetcommitments
 to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,titanium or composites) bec
omes unavailable to us or our suppliers, or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or moreof
 our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption fromone
 of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geopolitical developments, or as a result of performanceproblems or financial difficu
lties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operatingcosts.
Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers
 of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industryconsolidation,
 shifting  acquisition  and  budget  priorities,  and  continued  cost  pressure  at  our  U.S.  DoD  and  non-U.S.  customers  will  intensifycompetition
 for  many  of  our  BDS products.  Our  BGS  segment  faces  competition  from  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  competitorsfacing
 BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can beno assurance that we will be
 able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will notresult in reduced revenues and market share.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In
 2021, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 37% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S.
 sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doingbusiness internationally
, including:•
changes in regulatory requirements or other executive branc h actions, such as Executive Orders;•
changes in the global trade enviro nment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international trade authorities,that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outsi
de the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers in the form of tariffs,duties or penalties attributable to the importation of Boei
ng products and services;13

Table of Contents •
U.S.  and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrialcooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activ ities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.While
 the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. Forexample,
 since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanesand
 represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Impacts from these or future potential tariffs, or deterioration in traderelations
 between the U.S. and one or more other countries, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operationsand/or cash flows.
We
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for scheduleand
 technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables.
 Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program becausecosts
 also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related toperformance
 on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assessanticipated
 performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of futureaward fees are also included in sal
es and profit rates.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales
 to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period overwhich
 the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and othernon-recurring
 costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters ofintent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix,
14

Table of Contents production
 costs  and  rates,  learning  curve,  changes  to  price  escalation  indices,  costs  of  derivative  aircraft,  supplier  performance,  customer  andsupplier negoti
ations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. In addition, on development programs suchas
 the 777X, we are subject to risks with respect to the timing and conditions of aircraft certification, including potential gaps between when aircraftare
 certified in various jurisdictions, changes in certification processes and our estimates with respect to timing of future certifications, which couldhave
 an  impact  on  overall  program  status.  Any  such  change  in  estimates  relating  to  program  accounting  may  adversely  affect  future  financialperformance.
Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits,
 see our discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates – Accounting for Long-termContracts/Program Accounting” on pages 51 – 54 and N
ote 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 64 – 77 of this Form 10-K.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realizethe
 anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquiredbusiness, the performanc
e of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of theacquired
 operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,transaction-related
 charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partnerperformance
 and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. Whilewe
 believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that thesetransactions
 will be successful.  We also may make strategic divestitures  from time to time. These transactions  may result in continued financialinvolvement
 in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance bythose divested businesses could affect our future financi
al results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.Risks Related to Our Contracts
We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to un
ique risks.In
 2021, 49% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government.  Businessconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regul
ations and other unique risks.Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and cha
nges to those regulations could increase our costs. New procurement
 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperatin
g margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also result in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if wefail
 to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for our U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on ourbusiness.
 Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financialposition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
15

Table of Contents The
 U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The  U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail orterminate
 its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,funding
 pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due tofiscal
 constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programscould also
 result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”rather
 than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination ofone or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financi
al position, results of operations and/or cash flows.We
 are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.government
 contracts. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-pricecontracts
 enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced marginsor
 incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss ofproductivity
 due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses whichcan significantly affect our reported
 results. For example in the fourth quarter of 2021, BDS recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46ATanker
 contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs tocomplete
 the new Remote Vision System as the customer’s  requirements  definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward
 loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the processof
 estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied toperformance,
 which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisionsrelating to cost, schedule and performance.
Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price
 development  contracts  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25,  andcommercial and military satellites.

Table of Contents We enter into cost-type contracts, which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 32% and 31% of their 2021 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements.Some
 of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award orincentiv
e fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily inreduced
 fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  areprimarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defe
nse (GMD), Proprietary and SLS programs.We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Business Disruptions
Unauthorized access to our, our customers’ and/or our suppliers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information andinformatio
n technology systems for certain customers and/or suppliers. Many of these customers and/or suppliers face similar security threats. If wecannot
 prevent  the  unauthorized  access,  release  and/or  corruption  of  our  customers’  and/or  suppliers’  confidential,  classified  or  personallyidentifiable information, our reputation cou
ld be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our business may be impacted by disruptions includ
ing threats to physical security, information technology, or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging orextreme
 weather (including effects of climate change), or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptionscould
 affect  our  internal  operations  or  our  suppliers’  operations  and  delay  delivery  of  products  and  services  to  our  customers.  Any  significantproduction delays, or
 any destruction, manipulation or improper use of Boeing’s or our suppliers’ data, information systems or networks could impactour sales, increase our expenses and/or have an a
dverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.17

Table of Contents Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits,
 or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensiveregulation
 under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  aresometimes
 subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.government,
 the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certainproperty.
 Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  ourfinancial position, results of operations an
d/or cash flows.Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we are subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we are subject to such costs due to an indemnificationagreement
 between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In all cases, our current liabilities and ongoing cost assessmentsare
 based on current laws and regulations. New laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery ofpreviously
 unknown  contamination  or  the  imposition  of  new  remediation  requirements  could  result  in  additional  costs.  For  additional  informationrelating to environmental contingenc
ies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.
Increasing
 stakeholder environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations, physical and transition risks associated with climate change, andemerging
 ESG  regulation  and  policy  requirements  may  pose  risk  to  our  market  outlook,  brand  and  reputation,  financial  outlook,  cost  of  capital,global supply chain and production continuity, which may
 impact our ability to achieve long-term business objectives. Changes in environmental andclimate
 change laws or regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, requirenew
 or  additional  investment  in  product  designs,  result  in  carbon  offset  investments  or  otherwise  could  negatively  impact  our  business  and/orcompetitive
 position. Increasing aircraft performance standards and requirements on manufacturing and product air pollutant emissions, especiallygreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, may
 result in increased costs or reputational risks and could limit our ability to manufacture and/or market certainof
 our products at acceptable costs, or at all. Physical impacts of climate change, increasing global chemical restrictions and bans, and water andwaste requirements may drive increased costs to us and our suppliers an
d impact our production continuity and data facilities.Finally,
 from time to time, in alignment with our sustainability priorities, we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to improve ourenvironmental performance, such as our recent operational g
oals in areas of GHG emissions, energy, water and waste. If we fail to achieve or18

Table of Contents improperly
 report  on  our  progress  toward  achieving  our  environmental  goals  and  commitments,  the  resulting  negative  publicity  could  adverselyaffect our reputation and/or our access to capital.
Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity
We
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. In addition, our debt balances have increasedsignificantly
 since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue toactively
 manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, our debttotaled
 $58.1  billion  of  which  approximately  $11.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  Inaddition,
 as of December 31, 2021, our airplane financing commitments  totaled $12.9 billion. If we require additional funding in order to pay offexisting
 debt, address further impacts to our business related to the 737 MAX, COVID-19, 787 production issues or broader market developments,fund
 outstanding  financing  commitments  or  meet  other  business  requirements,  our  market  liquidity  may  not  be  sufficient.  These  risks  will  beparticular
ly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and tohave
 greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the  global  capital  marketsand/or a
 decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/orassociated
 changes in demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fundour operations and contractual or financing commitments.
Substantial
 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cashflows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
Many
 of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amountsrequired
 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent offuture
 contributions  depends  heavily  on  market  factors  such  as  the  discount  rate  and  the  actual  return  on  plan  assets.  We  estimate  futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individua
l contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. Wealso
 provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  andqualifying
 dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the levelof
 medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  planaccounting
 policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates - Pension Plans” on pages 54 - 55 ofthis
 Form 10-K. Although under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) the timing of periodic pensionand
 other postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense wouldalso likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S.
19

Table of Contents government.
 The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. Forexample,
 liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft  technologies,  space  systems,  spacecraft,  satellites,  missilesystems,
 weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurableon
 commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the2002
 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurancecoverage we maintain may be inadeq
uate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio isalso
 concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that webelieve
 have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financialdifficulties
 or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonableterms,
 or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our financial position, results ofoperations and/or cash flows could be material
ly adversely affected.Risks Related to Labor
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 47,000 employees, which constitute 33% of
 our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2021. We experienced awork
 stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labororganizations
 and  12  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  ourfinancial
 condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Workstoppages
 and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationshipswith customers and cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a
 global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,missile
 defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for theworldwide
 commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  weconduct operations in an expand
ing number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our
 strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) andGlobal Services
 (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generatedsubstantial
 earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing theservices that the market
 demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCAis committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior des
ign, safety, efficiency and value tocustomers
 around  the  world.  BDS  integrates  its  resources  in  defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and  services  to  delivercapability-driven
 solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our  BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-generationprograms
 while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGSprovides
 support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service  solutions.  BCCfacilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financin
g solutions for our Boeing customers.Business Environment and Trends
The
 global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continued tohave
 significant adverse impacts on our business in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel,creating
 a tremendous challenge for our customers,  our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing  and services sector. Thelatest
 International Air Transport Association (IATA) release reported that passenger traffic in 2021 recovered to approximately 40% of 2019 levels,as
 international markets saw continued reopening challenges. Additionally, global economic activity is improving, but continues to be impacted byCOVID-19,
 and governments continue to restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus. While recovery is accelerating, we continue to expect thatit will remain uneven as travel restrictions and varying regi
onal travel protocols continue to impact air travel.Generally, we continue to expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we exp
ect the narrow-body market to recoverfaster
 than  the  wide-body  market.  Also,  the  pace  of  the  commercial  market  recovery  will  be  heavily  dependent  on  COVID-19  infection  rates,vaccination
 rates, and government travel and other restrictions on trade and commercial activity. Demand for dedicated freighters continues to bestrong,
 underpinned by a strong recovery in global trade and overall air cargo growth. Overall cargo capacity remains challenged given the largeimpact that COVID-19 has had on international passe
nger operations, which also carry cargo.23

Table of Contents Airline
 financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.According
 to  IATA,  net  losses  for  the  airline  industry  were  $138  billion  in  2020  and  are  expected  to  be  approximately  $52  billion  in  2021.  Ourcustomers
 are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many forms,such
 as  deferrals  of  advances  and  other  payments  to  suppliers,  deferrals  of  deliveries,  reduced  spending  on  services  and,  in  some  cases,cancellation
 of  orders.  While  the  outlook  is improving  and we have seen an increase  in new orders  in 2021,  we continue  to  face  a challengingenvironment
 in the near- to medium-term as airlines have adjusted to reduced traffic, which in turn has resulted in lower demand for commercialaerospace products and services. The current environment is also affectin
g the financial viability of some airlines.We
 continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industryto
 return to long-term trend growth. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-term potential andcompetitiveness,
 we  have  reduced  the  production  rates  of  several  of  our  BCA  programs.  These  rate  decisions  are  based  on  our  ongoingassessments
 of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial airtraffic
 levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourth quarter of2020, we made
 adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We continue to anticipate that the first777X
 delivery will occur in late 2023. We will closely monitor the key factors  that affect backlog and future demand for each of our commercialaircraft
 programs, including customers’ evolving fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplinedrate
 management process and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, riskremains that
 further reductions will be required. Additionally, if we are unable to make timely deliveries of the large number of aircraft in inventory asof December 31, 2021, future revenues, earnings and cash flows w
ill be adversely impacted.Deliveri
es of the 737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rescinded the order that grounded737
 MAX aircraft in the U.S. In addition, other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency, TransportCanada
 and  the  European  Union  Aviation  Safety  Agency  have  subsequently  approved  return  of  operations,  allowing  us  to  resume  deliveries  inthose
 jurisdictions. Over 185 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued anairworthiness directive in the fourth quarter
 of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to Chinato
 resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around the timing and rate of those deliveries. Orders to suspendoperations of 737 MAX aircraft from non-U.S. civil aviation authorities are still in effect in a small n
umber of countries.Deliveries
 and production have also been impacted by production issues and associated rework. For example, deliveries of the 787 are currentlypaused
 and the production rate has been reduced while we focus on rework of undelivered aircraft and continue to engage in detailed discussionswith
 the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  for  resuming  deliveries.  Risk  remains  that  these  issues  may  continue  to  impact  the  timing  of  airplanedeliveries
 in inventory and/or our ability to achieve planned production rates. Revenues, earnings and cash flows will continue to be impacted untilwe are able to resume timely deliveries.

Table of Contents The
 long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensityto
 travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shockfrom
 COVID-19  has  reduced  the  near-  to  medium-term  demand,  but  our  Commercial  Market  Outlook  forecast  projects  a  4%  growth  rate  forpassenger
 and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual gross domesticproduct
 (GDP)  growth,  we  project  demand  for  approximately  43,610  new  airplanes  over  the  next  20  years.  The  industry  remains  vulnerable  toexogenous
 developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics andincreased global environmen
tal regulations.A
 Continuing Resolution (CR), enacted on December 3, 2021, continues funding for the federal government at FY21 appropriated levels throughFebruary
 18,  2022.  Congress  and  the  President  must  enact  either  full-year  FY22  appropriations  bills  or  an  additional  CR  to  fund  governmentdepartments and agencies beyond Fe
bruary 18, 2022 or a government shutdown could result, which may impact the Company’s operations.At
 BGS, while the outlook is improving, we are continuing to see a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and moreaircraft parked
 result in a decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionaryspending,
 such as modifications and upgrades, and focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period forthe
 commercial  services  business.  The  demand  outlook  for  our  government  services  business  remains  stable;  government  services  comprisesapproximately half of BGS revenue, which is uncha
nged from pre-pandemic levels.At
 BDS,  we  continue  to  see  a  healthy  market  with  solid  demand  for  our  major  platforms  and  programs  both  domestically  and  internationally.However,
 while we continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to COVID-19 impacts, we saw improvements in2021.
In
 addition,  we  are  experiencing  some  supply  chain  shortages.  Our  suppliers  are  also  experiencing  liquidity  pressures  and  disruptions  to  theiroperatio
ns as a result of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These measuresand disruptions have reduced overa
ll productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.We
 continue  to  transform  and  improve  our  business  processes.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  constrain  our  capacity  but  to  enable  theCompany to
 emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improvenear-term liquidity and long-term cost competitiveness.

 of $6,493 million on the 777X program. BCA’s loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of theyear,
 lower  wide-body  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues,  abnormalproduction costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 737 MAX customer consid

 grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) to most employees in December 2020. The increase in 2020 was due to increased grants of RSUs andother share-based compensation.
Deferred
 compensation expense increased by $33 million in 2021, primarily driven by changes in our stock price, and decreased by $81 million in2020, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditi

Table of Contents Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  eachcommercial airplan
e program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of salespercentage
 applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.Substantially
 all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government andother customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.

$377,499  $363,404 Contractual
 backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orderswhere customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual
backlog
 during 2021 was primarily due to new orders, reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts, increases inprice
 escalation and reductions in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of AccountingStandards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially
 offset by deliveries and cancellations. During 2021, we have had higher ASC 606adjustments of 787 orders as a result of delivery delays related to inspecti
ons and rework. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we remainunable
 to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 isfurther
 delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order  cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  continue  toexperience
 fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemicand associated impacts on demand.
Unobligated
 backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  decrease  inunobligated
 backlog  in  2021  was  primarily  due  to  reclassifications  to  contractual  backlog  related  to  BDS  and  BGS  contracts,  partially  offset  bycontract awards.
Additional Considerations
Global Trade 
We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical econom ic developments, as well as changes in tariffs,trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company.
The
 global economy continues  to experience significant  adverse impacts  due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  including a decline in overall trade ingeneral
 and in aerospace in particular. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the duration, scale and localization of these impacts to theglobal
 economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoringthe
 current  impact  and  potential  future  economic  consequences  of  COVID-19  to  the  global  economy,  the  aerospace  sector  and  our  Company.These adverse economic impacts have resulted in few
er orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.31

Table of Contents The
 current  state  of  U.S.-China  relations  remains  a  significant  watch  item.  China  is  a  very  significant  market  for  commercial  airplanes  andrepresents
 a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed an escalating series of tariffs oneach
 other’s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. The U.S. and China entered into aPhase
 I agreement in January 2020. However, as of December 31, 2021, implementation of this agreement is incomplete and overall diplomaticrelations between the U.S. and China h
ave deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments for potential adverse impacts to the Company.Beginning
 in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.trading
 partners  have  imposed,  or  announced  their  intention  to  impose,  tariffs  on  U.S.  goods.  In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Government,  Mexico  andCanada
 reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs  between these countries.  Implementation  of the U.S./Mexico/Canada  FreeTrade
 Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. In October 2021, the U.S. and European Union (EU) announced an agreement to easesteel and aluminum tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.
The
 current  status  of  U.S.-Russia  relations  is  creating  an  adverse  climate  for  our  business.  The  U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/orconsider
 imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and exportrestrictions
 that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.  Government  and  any  responses  from  Russia  that  could  directly  affect  our  supply  chain,  businesspartners or customers. We also continue to support the 737 MAX return to service in Russia.
The
 U.S. and EU have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft. As part ofthose
 disputes, in October 2019, the WTO authorized the U.S. to impose approximately $7.50 billion in annual tariffs on EU products in connectionwith
 the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. Following this authorization, the U.S. began to impose 15% tariffs onnew
 Airbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fuselages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, theWTO
 authorized the EU to impose approximately $3.99 billion in annual tariffs on U.S. products in connection with a tax incentive used by Boeing inWashington
 state that has since been repealed. Shortly thereafter, the EU began to impose 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU.On June 15,
 2021, the U.S. and EU announced that they had reached a cooperative framework to address the large civil aircraft disputes. As part ofthe framework,
 among other items, both sides announced an intent to continue to suspend tariffs related to the disputes for five years. The U.S. andU.K. announced a similar agreement on June 1

 The  industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, governmentrestrictions and
 new regulations. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts andresponses
 have  varied  globally,  the  reduction  of  demand  and  disruption  in  production  has  adversely  impacted  most  manufacturers  in  thecommercial airplane industry.

Table of Contents Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in d
ollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent onincreasing
 their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the737
 MAX  and  the  associated  suspension  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  multiple  jurisdictions  significantly  reduced  our  market  share  with  respect  todeliveries of single aisle aircraft in 201
9, 2020 and 2021 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase marketshare.
 With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition ofa
 majority  share  of  Bombardier’s  C  Series  (now  A220)  in  2018,  Airbus  continues  to  expand  in  the  100-150  seat  transcontinental  market.  Othercompetitors
 are  also  in  different  phases  of  developing  commercial  jet  aircraft.  Some  of  these  competitors  have  historically  enjoyed  access  togovernment-provided
 financial  support,  including  “launch  aid,”  which  greatly  reduces  the  cost  and  commercial  risks  associated  with  airplanedevelopment
 activities.  This  has  enabled  the  development  of  airplanes  without  broad  commercial  viability;  others  to  be  brought  to  market  morequickly
 than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency,which
 may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intensepressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to conti
nue or intensify in the coming years.We
 are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to competeand
 positions  us  for  market  recovery.  We  are  also  focused  on  taking  actions  to  ensure  that  Boeing  is  not  harmed  by  unfair  subsidization  ofcompetitors.

 believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required toperform.
 Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approvalfrom
 its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or haveexpired

 total  backlog  of  $296,882  million  at  December  31,  2021  increased  from  $281,588  million  at  December  31,  2020,  reflecting  new  orders  inexcess

 requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by aircraft order cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during theyear
 ended December 31, 2021 totaled $27,542 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments decreasedfor
 the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in an increase to backlog of $3,810 million primarily due to 777X aircraft, partially offset by787
 aircraft.  ASC  606  adjustments  include  consideration  of  aircraft  orders  where  a  customer  controlled  contingency  may  exist,  as  well  as  anassessment
 of whether the customer is committed to perform or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of considerationwhen it is due. If
 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we are unable to ramp up deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft, and/or if entry into service ofthe
 777X,  737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  ordercancellations.
 Additionally,  we  may  continue  to  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased  cancellations  across  all  of  our  commercial  airplaneprograms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on dema

 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram,
 including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantitiesquarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.

737 Program
 The  accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtainingadditional orders and deliv
ering airplanes. See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 747 Program
 We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 747 in the second half of 2022. We believe that ending production of the 74
7 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 36 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program.The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.
777
 and 777X Programs The  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2021 due to the program’s normal progress ofobtaining
 additional orders and delivering airplanes. The production rate for the combined 777/777X program is expected to increase from 2 permonth to 3 pe
r month in 2022.In
 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777Xwas
 completed during the first quarter of 2020. In 2021, we began offering the 777X freighter to customers and expect to receive initial orders in2022.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss
on the 777X program. The revised schedule an
d reach-36

Table of Contents forward
 loss reflected a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussionswith
 regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment ofCOVID-19
 impacts  on  market  demand  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraft  delivery  timing.  These  factors  resulted  inadjustments
 to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supplychain
 impacts. The initial accounting quantity of 350 airplanes established in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X passenger airplanes andremained unchanged during 2021.
We
 are working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIAand
 certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated  certification  requirementscould result in additional de
lays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31,
2021.
 The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, theimpacts
 of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further productionrate
 adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with thetesting
 program and the timing of aircraft  certification.  One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777Xprogram in future periods.
787
 Program During  2020,  we  experienced  significant  reductions  in  deliveries  due  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our  customers  as  well  asproduction
 issues and associated rework. During 2021 we delivered 14 aircraft between March 2021 and May 2021 prior to deliveries being pausedin May 2021. Deliveries remain paused.
At
 December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 110 and 80 aircraft in inventory. We have identified production quality issues, including inour
 supply chain, which have contributed to the pause in deliveries. In July 2021, we announced that we were reprioritizing production resources tosupport
 inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with theFAA
 regarding required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. We are currently producing at very low rates and expect that to continue untildeliveries
 resume,  gradually  returning  to  5  per  month  over  time.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  we  determined  that  in  the  current  environmentproduction
 rates below 5 per month represent abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs, and that inspections andrework
 costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensedas
 incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the ongoing rework, as well as our ongoing discussions with the FAA in anticipation ofresumption
 of  deliveries,  will  result  in  lower  production  rates  longer  than  previously  expected.  As  a  result  of  these  impacts,  we  expect  to  incurapproximately
 $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis with most being incurred by the end of 2023. We continue to work withcustomers
 and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes. We are also continuing to implement changes in theproduction
 process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. Duringthe
 first quarter of 2021, we consolidated 787 production in South Carolina, in line with our previous assumptions, which did not have a significantfinancial impact on the program.
During
 the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actionsrequired to resume 787 deliveries, taking lon
ger than37

Table of Contents expected. These impacts have resulted in long
er than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations.The
 timing  of  the  resumption  of  deliveries  and  future  production  rates  will  depend  upon  rework,  ongoing  customer  and  supplier  engagement,production
 stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787  program,  and  if  the  program  is  unable  to  obtainadditional
 orders  from  China  in  future  quarters,  we  may  be  required  to  further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  furtherreduce
 the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays or experience other factors that result in lower margins,the program could record additional losses a
nd higher abnormal production costs in future periods.Fleet Support
 We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1%  of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

The
 development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing ofcertifications will ultimately be determined by the regu
lators.Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well asthose
 of customers  and regulators,  can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated  rework.  Inaddition,
 the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  and  derivatives,  such  as  the  777X  and  737  MAX  derivatives,  involves  increased  risks  associated  withmeeting
 development,  production  and  certification  schedules.  These  challenges  include  increased  global  regulatory  scrutiny  of  all  developmentaircraft
 in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards andachieve or
 maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material chargeif
 an  airplane  program  has  or  is  determined  to  have  reach-forward  losses)  include  the  following:  changes  to  the  program  accounting  quantity,customer
 and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economicindicators,
 performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or addingnew
 production  capacity,  learning  curve,  additional  change  incorporation,  achieving  anticipated  cost  reductions,  the  addition  of  regulatoryrequirements
 in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for newairplanes
 and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the costand revenue estimates

 in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk asadditional completion costs may become necessary
 or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, ordercancellations or other financially si

Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
In May 2021, the U.S.
 government released the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2022 (FY22), which included $715 billion in funding for theUnited
 States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), $25 billion in funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and $19billion
 for the FAA. While the President’s budget request for FY22 includes funding for a majority of Boeing’s programs, it did not include funding forF/A-18
 Super Hornet, P-8 Poseidon and CH-47F Block II production aircraft. While there is continued congressional support for F/A-18 and CH-47FBlock
 II production aircraft for FY22, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to these and other program-level appropriations for FY22 and futurefiscal years. These programs also continue to pursue non-U.S. sales o
pportunities.In
 December  2021,  Congress  passed  and  the  President  signed  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY22,  which  authorizes  a  U.S.  DoDbudget
 $25 billion higher than the budget request. A CR, enacted on December 3, 2021, continues funding for the federal government at FY21appropri
ated levels through February 18, 2022. Congress and the President must enact either full-year FY22 appropriations bills or an additional CRto
 fund  government  departments  and  agencies  beyond  February  18,  2022  or  a  government  shutdown  could  result,  which  may  impact  theCompany’s
 operations. Alternatively, Congress may continue to fund the federal government through one or more additional CRs, however, thiswould continue to restrict the execution of certain program activities and d
elay new programs or competitions.Accordingly,
 there  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other  government  agencies,including
 NASA, for FY22 and beyond. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations andappropriations
 process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have amaterial effect on our results of operations, financial position an
d/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense
 Environment Overview The non-U.S.  market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the needto
 modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and theMiddle East given the diverse regiona
l threats. At the end of 2021, 33% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations

BDS
 revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to neworders
 for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraftprograms,
 Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year,largely due to the lower charges described b
elow.BDS
 revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52upgrades,
 proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impactof cumulative contract catch-up adjustme
nts, which were $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46ATanker charges during 2020.
Earnings From Operations
BDS
 earnings  from  operations  in  2021  increased  by  $5  million  compared  with  2020  primarily  due  to  less  unfavorable  impacts  from  cumulativecontract
 catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to2020
 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offsetprimarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnin
gs for United Launch Alliance (ULA).During
 the fourth quarter of 2021, BDS increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $402 million primarily due to continueddisruption
 in  the  factory  and  in  the  supply  chain,  including  impacts  of  COVID-19,  and  an  increase  in  costs  to  complete  the  new  Remote  VisionSystem
 as the customer’s requirements definition has evolved. In 2020, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $1,320 million on the KC-46A Tanker program reflecting $551 million of costs associ

n 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work.During
 the first quarter of 2021, we increased the reach-forward loss on VC-25B by $318 million, which was largely due to COVID-19 impacts andperformance
 issues at a key supplier. The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineeringinefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.
BDS
 earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the  unfavorable  impact  of  cumulativecontract
 catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A
 Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflectlower
 gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increasesdescribed above.

Total
 backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenuerecognized.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include  Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense,Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals fornew
 programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B,
 and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programscould
 also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs havehighly complex desi
gns. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which couldincrease
 our  estimated  cost  to  perform  the  work  or  reduce  our  estimated  price,  either  of  which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwiseadversely
 affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financialstatements are
 appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessaryor
 scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments or otherfinancially significant expos
ure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.41

Table of Contents Global Services
Business Environment and Trends
The
 aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; trainingand professional services; and information services. Prior to COVID-19, we ha
d expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however, thepandemic
 is having a direct impact on our commercial services business. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations for a discussi
on of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.Over
 the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed toincrease efficiency
 and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenanceto
 improve  their  productivity  and efficiency.  Airlines continue to look for  opportunities  to  reduce the size and cost  of their  spare  parts  inventory,frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.
The
 demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2021. Government services market segments are growing onpace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the
 single largest individualmarket,
 comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat andnon-U.S.
 fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expectless
 than  20  percent  of  the  worldwide  fleet  of  military  aircraft  to  be  retired  and  replaced  over  the  next  ten  years,  driving  increased  demand  forservices to maintain aging aircraft and enhance a

 of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraftproduct types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.
BCC
 provided customer financing of $14 million during 2020 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraftdeliveries
 in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices frombroad and globally diverse
 sources.Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 5,300 western-builtcommercial
 jet  aircraft  (20.5%  of  current  world  fleet)  were  parked  at  the  end of  2021,  including both  in-production  and out-of-production  aircrafttypes.
 Of  these  parked  aircraft,  a  larger  portion  are  expected  to  be  retired  compared  to  the  pre-COVID-19  period,  which  directly  impacts  theCompany
 in  terms  of  number  of  new  aircraft  deliveries  and  financing  opportunities,  the  ability  of  existing  customers  to  meet  current  paymentobligat
ions and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2020 and 2019,29.4% and 8.5% of
 the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft,particularly
 types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of  service.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition and Results of Operations for a discussi

BCC’s
 earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciationon leased equipment and other operatin

 Activities Net  cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion during 2021, compared with $18.4 billion during 2020 and $2.4 billionduring
 2019. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improvedchanges
 in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as areduction
 to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based
 plans expense reflecting a one-time stock grant to most employees in lieu of 2021 salary increases. The changes in assets and liabilitiesreflect
 the significant increase in commercial airplane inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAXgrounding.
 In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth waspartially
 offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled$2.5
 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021 and 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred ProsecutionAgreement betwe
en Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash providedby
 Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020.The
 pause  in  787  deliveries  and  the  residual  impacts  of  the  737  MAX  grounding  are  expected  to  continue  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  ouroperating cash flows until 787 del
iveries resume and 737 MAX deliveries ramp up.The
 decrease in operating cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by our net loss in 2020 and changes in assets and liabilities,partially
 offset by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020, whichwas
 recorded  as  a  reduction  to  inventory.  The  year-over-year  increase  in  non-cash  items  also  reflects  higher  inventory  write-downs  and  higherallowances
 for expected credit losses in 2020. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect increases in commercial airplane inventory due to thelarge
 number of undelivered aircraft in 2019 resulting from the 737 MAX grounding, and in 2020 due to the 737 MAX grounding, 787 productionissues
 and COVID-19 impacts. Cash used by Advances and progress billings was $1.1 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided byAdvances
 and  progress  billings  in  2019.  The  changes  in  assets  and  liabilities  in  2020  also  reflect  lower  accounts  payable  due  to  reductions  incommercial
 purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during2020 and $1.2 billion d
uring 2019. The accrued liability45

Table of Contents for 737 MAX customer considerations at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $
7.4 billion favorable change to assets and liabilities in 2019.Payables
 to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion for the years endedDecember
 31, 2021 and 2020, and increased by $2.6 billion in 2019. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines forthe
 years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the yearended
 December  31,  2019  reflects  a  combination  of  higher  purchases,  an  extension  of  payment  terms  with  certain  suppliers  and  increasedutilization of our supply chain financ
ing programs.Investing
 Activities Cash  provided by investing activities during 2021 was $9.3 billion, compared with cash used by investing activities of $18.4billion
 and $1.5 billion during 2020 and 2019. The increase in cash inflows in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to $27.1 billion of higher netproceeds
 from investments. The increase in cash outflows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions toinvestments.
 Net proceeds from investments were $9.8 billion in 2021, compared with net contributions to investments of $17.3 billion in 2020 andnet
 proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion in 2021, compared with $1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.8billion
 in  2019.  We  reduced  our  capital  expenditures  in  2021  and  2020  as  we  managed  our  liquidity  throughout  the  pandemic  and  737  MAXgrounding. We expect capital expend
itures in 2022 to be higher than in 2021.Financing
 Activities Cash  used by financing activities was $5.6 billion during 2021, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $35.0billion
 during  2020  and  $5.7  billion  in  2019.  The  decrease  of  $40.6  billion  compared  with  2020  primarily  reflects  net  debt  repayments  in  2021compared
 with net borrowings in 2020. The increase of $29.3 billion in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflects higher net borrowings, lowershare
 repurchases and lower dividend payments, which reflects the Company’s decision in March 2020 to suspend the declaration or payment ofdividends
 until  further  notice.  During  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  debt  repayments  net  of  new  borrowings  were  $5.6  billion,primarily
 due to $13.8 billion of repayments of our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement, partially offset by $9.8 billion of fixed ratesenior notes issued
 in the first quarter of 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3billion,
 primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8 billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed drawterm
 loan  agreement  entered  into  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020.  During  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2019,  new  borrowings  net  ofrepayments
 were $13.2 billion, primarily due to the issuance of $10.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes in 2019. For further discussion see LiquidityMatters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Stateme

 December 31, 2021 and 2020 debt balances totaled $58.1 billion and $63.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as short-term.
 This included $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2021 and 2020, of which $0.3 billion and $0.9 billionwere classified as short-term.
During
 the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and 2020,  we  did not  repurchase  any shares  through  our  open  market  share  repurchase  programcompared
 to repurchases of 6.9 million shares in 2019 totaling $2.7 billion. Share repurchases under this plan have been suspended since April2019.
 In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.We
 had 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 0.6 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Duringthe
 year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  paid  no  dividends,  compared  with  $1.2  billion  and  $4.6  billion  in  2020  and  2019.  In  March  2020,  theCompany announced that our divid

 expect  to  be  able  to  fund  our  cash  requirements  through  cash  and  short-term  investments  and  cash  provided  by  operations,  as  well  ascontinued
 access to capital markets. At December 31, 2021, we had $8.1 billion of cash, $8.2 billion of short-term investments, and $14.7 billion ofunused
 borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these revolving credit lines will remain undrawn and primarilyserve as
 backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Of the $14.7 billion of unused borrowing capacity, $6.3 billion expires inOctober 2022, $5.3 billion expires in March 202
3 and $3.2 billion expires in October 2024.Our
 debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, and we are continuing to actively manage our liquidity. In 2021, we repaid $13.8 billionthat was outstanding under our two-year delayed dra
w term loan credit agreement that had a final maturity date of February 6, 2022.Our
 increased debt balance resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings in 2020, and our ratings remained unchanged in 2021. We expect to beable to access capital markets when we require add
itional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related tomarket
 developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incurincreased
 borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declinesin the
 global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to theCOVID-19
 pandemic and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject tofurther credit rating downgrades. The
 occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing orcontractual commitments.
Any
 future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance withthe
 covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  a  limitation  on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leasebacktransactions
 as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as apercentage
 of  total  capital  (as  defined  in  the  credit  agreements).  When  considering  debt  covenants,  we  continue  to  have  substantial  borrowingcapacity.

Table of Contents Pension
 and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits Pension  cash  requirements  are  based  on  an  estimate  of  our  minimum  funding  requirements,pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
 regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimatesof
 other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are fundedthrough trusts.
At
 December  31,  2021  and  2020,  our  pension  plans  were  $7.8  billion  and  $13.7  billion  underfunded  as  measured  under  Generally  AcceptedAccounting
 Principles in the United States of America (GAAP). On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2021.We
 do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2022. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pensionplans in future years.
In
 the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began usingour
 common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future. Under this approach, common stockis
 contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay period. We expect this measure to further enable the Company to conserve cash. We haveretained an independe
nt fiduciary to manage and liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.Purchase
 Obligations Purchase  obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify afixed,
 minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  thetransaction.
 Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of FinancialPosition.
Purchase
 obligations  not  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  include  agreements  for  inventory  procurement,  toolingcosts,
 electricity  and  natural  gas  contracts,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  customer  financing  equipment  and  other  miscellaneous  productionrelated
 obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement  contracts.  We have entered into certain significant inventoryprocurement contracts that
 specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials onbehalf
 of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet ourproduction
 schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for manyof our products.
 A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted insettlement
 through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts arealso
 included  in  our  forecasts  of  costs  for  program  and  contract  accounting.  Some  inventory  procurement  contracts  may  include  escalationadjustments.
 In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in thetable above.
Purchase
 obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other currentand long-term liabilities inclu

 have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/ortechnology
 or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. Thesecommitments
 may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supplycontracts,
 transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties(such
 as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet ourindustrial

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information.These
 non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies maydefine such measures different
ly. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to relyon
 any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service costadjustment. The FAS/
49

Table of Contents CAS service cost adjustment
 represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costscalculated under GAAP and costs alloc
ated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustmentand
 non-operating  pension and postretirement  expenses.  Non-operating  pension and postretirement  expenses represent  the components  of netperiodic
 benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP areallocated
 to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supportinggovernment
 customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (CAS),  which  employ  different  actuarialassumptions
 and  accounting  conventions  than  GAAP.  CAS  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other  postretirement  benefit  costs  areallocated to all business segments bas
ed on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The
 Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $882 million in 2021, $1,024 million in 2020and
 $1,071 million in 2019. The lower benefits in 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operatingpension
 expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The higherbenefits
 in  2021  were  primarily  due  to  lower  interest  cost  and  higher  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  partially  offset  by  higher  amortization  ofactuarial losse
s and higher settlement charges. The benefits in 2020 and 2019 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization ofactuarial losses.
For
 further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 29 of this Form 10-K andsee
 Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings pershare
 for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provideinvestors
 additional  insights  into  operational  performance  as unallocated  pension and other  postretirement  benefit  cost  primarily  represent  costsdriven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
Accounting for Long-term Contracts
Substantially
 all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinctperformance
 obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant serviceof integration that we provide.
Accounting
 for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation.Cost
 of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reportedas cost of sales.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicatedand subject
 to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflation
 or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based onestimated
 cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  bereimbursed
 in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule risk, internal and
 subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, COVID-19 disruptions, asset utilization and anticipatedlabor agreements.
Revenue and
 cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in theseestimates
 could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of salesand
 profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or anadjustment to
 a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, netunfavorable
 cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by $880 million, $942 million and $111million,
 respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2021 were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A Tanker, VC-25B andCommercial
 Crew  programs.  These  are  all  fixed-price  development  programs,  and  there  is  ongoing  risk  that  similar  losses  may  have  to  berecognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.
Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if weused different
 assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,or
 circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term
 contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year byapproximately $300 million.
Program Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  revenues,  costs  and  gross  profit  margin  for  the  defined  programaccounting
 quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term
 production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability tomake reasonably dependable e
stimates.52

Table of Contents Factors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof intent from
 prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales pricefor
 all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices forall
 undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are basedlargely
 on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections.Factors
 that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims orassertions, asset utilization, anticipated lab
or agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includesreassessing
 the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  gross  profit  margins  are  normally  recognized  on  a  prospective  basis;however, when estimated costs to
 complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a lossis
 recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accountingquantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an e
arnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.The
 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changesto the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional e
arnings charges in future periods.777X Program
 During  the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billionreach-forward
 loss  on  the  777X  program.  The  revised  schedule  and  reach-forward  loss  reflected  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updatedassessment
 of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarterof
 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with ourcustomers
 with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity,increased
 change  incorporation  costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain  impacts.  The  initial  accounting  quantity  of  350  airplanesestablished in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X pass
enger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.We
 are working towards reaching TIA which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimatelybe
 determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays inentry into service and/or additional cost increases.
We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31,
2021.
 The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, theimpacts
 of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further productionrate
 adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with thetesting
 program and the timing of aircraft  certification.  One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777Xprogram in future periods, which may be material.
53

Table of Contents 787 Program
 The  787 program’s production issues and delivery pause result in significant uncertainties regarding the revenue and cost estimatesfor
 the 787 program. Deliveries have remained paused since May 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on theprogram primarily due to
 rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. The estimateof
 customer  considerations  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  our  current  assumptions  regarding  timing  of  FAA  approval  enablingresumption
 of  deliveries,  estimated  timing  of  completion  of  inspections  and  rework  to  enable  deliveries  in  future  periods,  estimated  timing  ofproduction
 rate increases as well as customer and market assessments. We continue to conduct inspections and rework and engage in detaileddiscussions
 with  the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  for  resuming  delivery  of  the  787.  Our  program  revenue  and  cost  estimates  reflect  theassumption
 that production rates will remain very low until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. We have also assumedlower
 forecasted  revenues  due  to  delayed  deliveries.  Our  program  assumptions  reflect  our  current  best  estimate.  However,  if  the  programexperien
ces further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, wecould record additional losses i
n future periods, which may be material.Goodwill Impairments
We
 test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, weevaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as
 an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is morelikely
 than  not  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  net  assets  is  more  than  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit,  then  a  quantitative  test  is  performed;otherwise,
 no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to theestimated
 fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of thegoodwill represents the amount of goodw
ill impairment.We generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combi
nation of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologiessuch
 as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costsand
 changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles,contracts
 with  suppliers,  labor  agreements  and  general  market  conditions.  Changes  in  these  forecasts  could significantly  change  the  amount  ofimpairment
 recorded,  if any. The cash flow forecasts  are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus asuitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, chang
es in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We
 completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31,2021,
 we  estimated  that  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  significantly  exceeded  its  corresponding  carrying  value.  Changes  in  our  forecasts,discount
 rates or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwillimpairment charges in future periods.
Pension Plans
Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  anannual measurement of
 our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discountrate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences betwee
n actual and expected54

Table of Contents outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expens
e, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The
 projected  benefit  obligation  is  sensitive  to  discount  rates.  The  projected  benefit  obligation  would  decrease  by  $2,240  million  or  increase  by$2,530
 million  if  the  discount  rate  increased  or  decreased  by  25  basis  points.  A  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  would  not  have  asignificant
 impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. Adecrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return
 would have increased or decreased 2021 net periodic pensioncost
 by $155 million. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-termrate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.
Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance
The
 Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,258 million at December 31, 2021 that can be used in future years to offset taxable incomeand
 reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $8,976 million at December 31, 2021 that will partially offsetdeferred
 income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whetherfuture
 reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years inwhich
 temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset orsettlement of the related liability.
On
 a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income andreduce
 the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not(defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such ass
ets will not be realized.This
 assessment  takes  into  account  both  positive  and negative  evidence.  A recent  history  of  financial  reporting  losses  is  heavily  weighted  as asource of
 objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earningsin
 our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable incomeand
 when  deferred  tax  assets  will  reverse  and  generate  tax  deductions.  The  selection  of  methodologies  and  assessment  of  when  temporarydifferences
 will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. Webelieve that the methodologies we us
e are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.Deferred tax liabiliti
es represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during thenext
 five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significantdeductible amounts beyond five years.
 The Company’s valuation allowance of $2,423 million at December 31, 2021 primarily relates to pension andother postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyon
d the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilitiesare
 assumed to occur. During 2021, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $671 primarily due to favorable pension remeasurement.Until
 the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverseimpacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive inc
ome.For additional information regarding i
ncome taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.55

Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We have financial instruments that
 are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assetsand
 liabilities.  The  investors  in  our  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  do  not  generally  have  the  right  to  demand  we  pay  off  these  obligations  prior  tomaturity.
 Therefore,  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  is  not  believed  to  be  material  for  our  fixed-rate  debt.  In  2021,  we  repaid  the  $13.8  billionoutstanding
 under our two-year floating-rate delayed draw term loan credit agreement. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we do not have anysignificant
 floating-rate  debt  obligations.  Historically,  we  have  not  experienced  material  gains  or  losses  on  our  customer  financing  assets  andliabilities due to interest rate changes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2021,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $241 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.Commodity Price Risk
We
 are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in themarket
 price.  We  use  commodity  swaps  and  commodity  purchase  contracts  to  hedge  against  these  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes.  Ourcommodity
 purchase  contracts  and  derivatives  are  both  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  market  price.  At  December  31,  2021,  a  10%  increase  ordecrease
 in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $46 million. Consistent withthe
 use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by correspondinggains
 or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchasecontracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31
, 2021, 2020 and 2019(Dollars in millions, except otherwise stated)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the
 “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions  have been eliminated. As described in Note 22, weoperate
 in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing Capital(BCC).
Liquidity Matters
The
 global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continue tohave
 significant adverse impacts on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow infuture
 quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for ourcustomers,
 our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. We continue to expect commercial air travel toreturn
 to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. There issignificant
 uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point capacity will return to and/orexceed pre-COVID-19 levels.
During
 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. Our operating cash flows continue to be impacted by lower commercial airplanedeliveries
 and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers. We expect negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramp up. In 2021, weissued
 $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2026. We used the net proceeds of these note issuances to repay the$13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term
 loan credit agreement. In 2021, we also repaid $1.5 billion of term notes. As a result,our
 cash and short-term investment balance was $16.2 billion and our debt balance was $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition, we haveterm notes of $1.2 billion maturing in 2022.
As
 of December 31, 2021, our unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements is $14.7 billion. We anticipate that these revolving creditlines will remain undrawn and
 primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Our borrowing capacity includesa $3.1 billion 364-day revolvi
ng credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2022. See Note 15.In
 2021, our short-term and long-term credit ratings by the major credit rating agencies remained unchanged from 2020. There is risk for furtherdowngrades.
At
 December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade payables included $2.3 billion and $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supplychain
 financing programs. While access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do notbelieve that these or future changes in the availa
bility of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.In
 addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During 2020, our Board of Directors terminated its priorauthorization
 to repurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends untilfurther
64

Table of Contentsnotice.
 We have also reduced production rates in our commercial business to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the industry. We rationalized ourworkforce
 through  a  combination  of  voluntary  and  involuntary  layoffs  and  natural  turnover.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  began  using  ourcommon stock in lieu of cash to
 fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans. In December 2020, we awarded most of our employees a one-timestock
 grant  that  will  vest  in three  years  in  lieu of  merit  pay increases.  We  have  reduced  discretionary  spending,  including  reducing  or  deferringresearch and development and capita
l expenditures. We expect these actions to further enable the Company to conserve cash.We
 are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. For example, the United States Department ofDefense
 (U.S. DoD) has taken steps to work with its industry partners to increase liquidity in the form of increased progress payment rates andreductions in withholds among other initiatives. In
 addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included a five-year netoperating loss carryback provision which e
nabled us to benefit from certain 2020 losses and resulted in tax refunds of $1.7 billion in 2021.We
 continue  to  transform  and  improve  our  business  processes.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  constrain  our  capacity  but  to  enable  theCompany to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers.
Based
 on  our  current  best  estimates  of  market  demand,  planned  production  rates,  timing  of  cash  receipts  and  expenditures,  our  ability  tosuccessful
ly implement further actions to improve liquidity as well as our ability to access additional liquidity, if needed, we believe it is probable thatwe will be able to fund our operations for the foreseea
ble future.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements  in conformity  with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles  (GAAP) requires  management to makeestimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe
 financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the accounting estimatesand
 assumptions are appropriate, however, given the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19pandemic actual results could differ from those estimates.
Operating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year.
Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial
 aircraft contracts The  majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contracts. For each contract, wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraftperformance
 obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.Revenue
 is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by thecustomer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
In
 certain situations, where an aircraft  is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  (known as a bill-and-holdarrangement), revenue will be recognized w
hen all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.65

Table of ContentsPayments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includ
es a deposit upon order andadditional
 payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances andprogress
 billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financingcomponent as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately compl
ete some or all of its obligations under the contract.Long-term contracts
 Substantially  all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and othercustomers
 that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurityproducts,
 surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems  and  modification  of  commercialpassenger
 aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associatedwith our commercial and defense products and space travel o
n Commercial Crew.For
 each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transactionprice
 to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standaloneselling
 prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelatednature
 of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term
 contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  notinclude
 potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition forthe
 additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costsincurred
 plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration,such
 as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value,based on a weighted probab
ility, or the most likely amount.Long-term contract revenue is
 recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as servicesare
 rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to thecustomer.
 For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow thecustomer
 to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work inprocess.
 Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractualtermination
 clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do nothave an alternative use to the Company.
The
 accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance obligation.Cost of
 sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit tothe
 amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales.  Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-termcontract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.
For
 long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operatingincome
 are  recognized  using  a  cumulative  catch-up  adjustment  which  recognizes  in  the  current  period  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  changes  oncurrent and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-compl
etion. When the current estimates of66

Table of Contentstotal sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the lon
g-term contract is recognized.Net
 cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses, across all long-term contractswere as follows:
2021
2020 2019 Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue
($379) ($359) $54 Increase to Loss from operations
($880) ($942) ($111) Decrease to Diluted EPS
($1.28) ($1.37) ($0.06) Significant adjustments during the three years end
ed December 31, 2021 included losses on KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and VC-25B.Due to the
 significance of judgment in the estimation process, changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance or circumstancesmay adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.
Payments
 under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholdspayment
 of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables(contract
 assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances andprogress
 billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company inthe event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial
 spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fairvalue.
 We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  partperformance obligation at
 the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare partwhere
 a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination ofthese
 items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded ataverage cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.
Other service revenue contracts
 Certain contracts  at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,training,
 data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the servicesare
 rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts thetransfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.
Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessionsincurred
 may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s pro
ducts or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.Unbilled
 Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled  receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenuefor amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the
67

Table of Contentscontract
 with  the  customer.  Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  arise  when  the  Company  receives  payments  from  customers  inadvance of recognizing revenue. The amo
unt of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.Financial
 Services Revenue We  record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases and loans in Salesof
 services  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.  For  sales-type  leases,  we  recognize  revenue  if  collection  of  the  lease  payments  isprobable.
 For  sales-type  and  finance  leases,  we  record  customer  financing  receivables  at  lease  inception.  A  customer  financing  receivable  isrecorded
 at  the  aggregate  of  future  minimum  lease  payments,  estimated  residual  value  of  the  leased  equipment,  and  any  deferred  incrementaldirect
 costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Fornotes
 receivable, notes are recorded as customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs.Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Income
 recognition  is  generally  suspended  for  customer  financing  receivables  that  are  uncollectible. We  determine  that  a  customer  financingreceivable
 is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according tothe
 original  contractual  terms.  We  determine  a  customer  financing  receivable  is  past  due when  cash  has  not  been  received  upon  the  due  datespecified in the contract.
We
 evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable isdetermined
 to be uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement,sales-type lease revenue
 is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If we have adirect
 finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes tonon-accrual
 status  after  commencement,  we  recognize  contractual  interest  income  as  payments  are  received  to  the  extent  there  is  sufficientcollateral and payments exceed past due pri
ncipal payments.Residual
 values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition ofthe leased
 equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in whic
h the declines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method overthe
 period  that  we  project  we  will  hold  the  asset.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $126,$129
 and $151 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$129,
 $136  and  $150  during  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively
 known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineeringsupport, and
68

Table of Contentstechnical
 data  and  documents.  Fleet  support  activity  begins  prior  to  aircraft  delivery  as  the  customer  receives  training,  manuals,  and  technicalconsulting
 support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s  operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support,consulting
 on maintenance, repair and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, andthe
 issuance  of  service  bulletins  that  impact  the  entire  model’s  fleet.  Field  service  support  involves  our  personnel  located  at  customer  facilitiesproviding and coordinatin
g fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment
 products  and  services,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  unless  the  costs  are  related  to  certain  contractual  arrangements  withcustomers.
 Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistentwith
 our long-term contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best effortsresearch
 and  development  accounting.  Accordingly,  the  amounts  funded  by  the  customer  are  recognized  as  an  offset  to  our  research  anddevelopment
 expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $213, $224 and$214 in 2021, 2020 and 2019
, respectively.Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon
 the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensationexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.Income Taxes
Provisions
 for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current taxlaw
 and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred taxassets
 and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense arerecognized
 in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determiningincome tax provisions and evaluatin
g tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax benefit.
We
 also  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets  against  future  sources  of  taxable  income  and  reduce  thecarrying amounts
 of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or aportion
 of such assets will not be realized. Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in anincrease or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensiv
e income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.69

Table of ContentsPostretirement Plans
Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirementbenefit
 plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under thepension
 and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefitsare
 also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using theprojected unit credit
 method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset returnand
 medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  the  service  cost  component  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirementincome
 or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and reflected ininventory
 at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, arereflected
 in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, weamortize
 them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected onthe Consolidated Statements of Financia
l Position.Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.Environmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations
 and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased on our best estimate
 or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.Estimated
 remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able torecover
 a  portion  of  the  remediation  costs  from  insurers  or  other  third  parties.  Such  recoveries  are  recorded  when  realization  of  the  claim  forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere $47 and $74 at December 31, 2021 an
d 2020.Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring costs, and applicable overhea
d, which includes fringe70

Table of Contentsbenefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and
 plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extenta
 material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, theyare
 expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-termproduction
 cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is anallocation of allowabl
e costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.The
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.Used
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  notmaterialize or we determine the costs are no longer probabl
e of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.71

Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciat
ed principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment, from
 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; andmachinery
 and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straightline method over 5
 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term ofthe
 hosting arrangement, which is typically no greater than 10 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable livesassigned to long-lived assets, inclu
ding assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Leases 
We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  at  the  inception  date.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  Other  assets,  with  therelated
 liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under  finance  leases,  which  primarily  represent  computerequipme
nt, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-termdebt and Long-term debt on the Consolidate
d Statements of Financial Position.Operating
 lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make leasepayments
 arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimatedpresent
 value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of leasepayments.
 Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed asincurred
 and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonablycertain that we will exercise that option. Lease expe
nse is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We have real property lease agreements with lease an
d non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.Asset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.We
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly,
 these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded inthe
 period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’sfair
 value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certainbuildings but we have not become a
ware of it through the normal course of72

Table of Contentsbusiness), and therefore, these obligations als
o have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  quantitative  test.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a  qualitativeassessment and determine it
 is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, thequantitative
 test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare thecarrying
 value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, theshortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represe
nts the amount of goodwill impairment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  a  brand  and  trade  name  and  in-process  research  and  development  (IPR&D)  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
 IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. IPR&Dis
 reclassified  to finite-lived  acquired intangible assets  when a project  is completed  and then amortized  on a straight-line  basis over the asset’sestimated
 useful life. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing the carrying values to current projections of related discounted cashflows. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flo
ws represents the amount of the impairment.Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 4
 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from1
 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows ofthe asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-saledebt
 securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.Available-for-sale debt securities are assesse
d for impairment quarterly.The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings ap
proach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.Other
 Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable
 fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
73

Table of ContentsWe
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss onthe disposition of these
 investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic
 purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments orgain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.Derivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For our cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initiallyreported
 in  comprehensive  income  and  is  subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period(s)  during  which  the  hedged  forecastedtransaction
 affects earnings. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S.business requirements.
 These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We alsohold
 certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreementsand
 for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  are  recorded  in  earningsimmediately.
Allowances for Losses on Certain Financial Assets
We
 establish allowances for credit losses on accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, customer financing receivables and certain other financialassets. The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consider
ation of factors such as customer credit ratings, bankruptcy filings,published
 or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates and collateral exposures. We determine the creditworthinessof
 our customers by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customers.Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major credit rating agenc
ies.Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement
 for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchasecommitment would become a
 trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
74

Table of ContentsExposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.Used aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases
 are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. Customer financing is collateralized by security in therelated asset.
We
 assess the fair value of equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables to determine iftheir
 fair values are less than the related customer financing assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance
 leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses onreceivables.
We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease
 We  evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods in which the asset may be held in prep
aration for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining75

Table of Contentseconomic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
When
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for  losses  on  customer  financing  receivables We  record  the  estimated  allowance  for  potential  losses  on  customer  financingreceivables
 in a valuation account. The four primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables arecollateral values, internal customer credit ratings, default rates and exp
ected loss rate.We
 review  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  for  losses  by  assessing  the  collateral  exposure,  the  applicable  default  rate  and  expected  loss  rate.Collateral
 exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. Areceivable
 with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable default rate isdetermined
 using two components: internal customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. We assign internal credit ratingsfor
 all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directlyfrom our
 customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. We apply an expected loss rate, basedon publicly availabl
e information, to the applicable default rate.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each
 quarter  we  review  the  assigned  internal  customer  credit  ratings,  published  historical  credit  default  rates  for  different  rating  categories  andmultiple
 third-party  aircraft  value  publications  as  a  basis  to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for  losses  on  customer  financingreceivables. There can be no assurance that actual resu
lts will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will notresult in an increase or decrease to the allowanc
e for losses on customer financing receivables.Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and
 design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standardwarranty
 for  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  or  manufactured  to  certain  standards  under  ourauthorization.
 These  warranties  are  included  in  the  programs’  estimate  at  completion.  On  occasion  we  have  made  commitments  beyond  thestandard
 warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warrantiesissued
 by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons systems. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month
 to two -year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts  and  software  manufactured  by  us  to  certain  contractualspecifications.
 Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warrantyliabil
ity recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered timesthe average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additi
onal amounts for76

Table of Contentscertain
 major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to theinitial liability estimate.
We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.Guarantees
We
 record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of theexpected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplyin
g the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,if applicable. At inception of a guarante
e, and adjusted each quarter, we also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss.Note 2 – Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles

Basic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.

   On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which includes a five year net operating loss (NOL) carryback provision which enabled us tobenefit
 from the 2020 U.S. federal tax NOL at the former federal tax rate of 35%. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded tax expense of $3 and taxbenefits of $1,175 related to the NOL carryback provision.
    In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employ
ee share-based payments of $6, $82 and $180, respectively. 
   In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $587 related to the settlement of the 2015-2017 federal tax audit. In the fourth quarterof 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $371 related to the settlement of state tax audits spannin
g 15 tax years.In
 2020 and 2019, we recorded tax benefits related to foreign derived intangible income of $31 and $229, respectively which effectively apply alower U.S. tax rate to intangible income derived from serving non-U.S. markets.

($141) ($924) The
 Company’s deferred income tax assets of $11,258 can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. TheCompany’
s deferred income tax liabilities of $8,976 will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future yearsand
 increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether  future  reversals  of  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  and  deductibleamounts
 that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generallyare
 determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesrelate
 primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated a tax NOL in 2020 that wascarried
 back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to the CARES Act benefit as described above. The Company generated tax NOL andinterest
 carryovers in 2021 that can be carried forward indefinitely and federal research and development credits that can be carried forward 20years.
In
 the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021, the Company was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. We also normalized earningsand
 other  comprehensive  income  (OCI)  for  certain  non-recurring  items  and  reached  a  normalized  three-year  cumulative  loss  position  in  2021.Adjustments
 to  normalize  earnings  included  non-recurring  items  for  certain  737  MAX  expenses,  an  agreement  with  the  Department  of  Justice,severance costs and remeasurement gains and losses from the annu

 of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, theCompany determined that it could not include future proj
ected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.As of
 December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $2,423 and $3,094 primarily for certain federal deferred taxassets,
 as well as for certain federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Companyestimated
 in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversalpatterns.
 Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years whiledeferred
 tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax deductions over thenext 15 to 20
 years. The valuation allowance primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriatefuture periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.
During 2021,
 the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $671. This reflects a tax benefit of $1,206 included in OCI primarily due to the netactuarial
 gains  that  resulted  from  the  annual  remeasurement  of  pension  assets  and  liabilities.  This  was  partially  offset  by  tax  expense  of  $512recorded in continuing operatio
ns and an increase of $23 related to the associated federal benefit of state impacts.Until
 the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverseimpacts on earnings and/or OCI.
The
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributedearnings
 previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings from certainnon-U.S.
 subsidiaries  because  such  earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  If  such  earnings  were  to  be  distributed,  any  deferredincome taxes would not be significant.
As
 of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the ConsolidatedStatements
 of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  notsignificant for the years ended December 31, 2021, 202

nker and Commercial Crew. See Note 13.Commercial Aircraft Programs
The
 decrease in commercial aircraft programs inventory during 2021 reflects lower 737 MAX inventory due to resumption of deliveries and a reach-forward
 loss on the 787 program. These decreases were partially offset by a continued buildup of 787 aircraft, as well as growth in 777X inventory.Commercial
 aircraft programs inventory includes approximately 335 737 MAX aircraft and 110 787 aircraft at December 31, 2021 as compared with425 737 MAX aircraft and 80 787 aircraft at December 31, 2020.
A
 number  of  customers  have  requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders.  We  are  currently  remarketing  certain  aircraft  and  may  have  toremarket
 additional aircraft in future periods. If we are unable to successfully remarket the aircraft, determine further production rate reductions arenecessary,
 and/or contract the program accounting quantities, future earnings may be reduced and/or additional reach-forward losses may have tobe recorded.
At
 December  31,  2021  and  2020,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  737  program:  deferredproduction
 costs of $1,296 and $2,159 and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $617 and $480. At December 31, 2021, $1,906 of737
 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the programaccounting
 quantity that have firm orders, and $7 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that representexpected future orders.
At
 December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $3,363 and$1,727 of work in process and $3,521 and $3,2
95 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs.During
 the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus costs already included in 777X inventoryexceed estimated revenues
 from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $6,493 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs.As
 a result, 777X deferred production costs were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and remain immaterial  at December 31, 2021. The level ofprofitability
 on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19
 on  our  production  system  as  well  as  impacts  on  our  supply  chain  and  customers,  further  production  rate  adjustments  for  the  777X  or  othercommercial
 aircraft programs, any contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing ofaircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777
X program in future periods.During
 the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 787 program plus costs already included in 787 inventoryexceed estimated revenues
 from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,460 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs.At

 allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in thefourth
 quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subjectto final regulatory appro
vals, although risk remains around the timing and rate of those deliveries. Over 185 countries have approved the resumptionof 737 MAX operations. The 737 MAX remains grounde
d in a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions.We
 have gradually increased production rates in 2020 and 2021 and continue to expect to increase the production rate to 31 per month by early2022, as well as implement further gradual productio
n rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand and supply chain capacity.We
 produced at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021 and expensed abnormal production costs of $1,887 and $2,567 during the yearsended
 December 31, 2021 and 2020. We do not expect the remaining abnormal costs related to the 737 MAX to be significant and expect most ofthe remainder to be incurred in early 2022.
In
 2021, we delivered 245 aircraft. We have approximately 335 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2021 and we anticipate delivering most ofthese
 aircraft by the end of 2023. We continue to work with customers who have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAXaircraft,
 and we are remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. In the event that we are unable to resumeaircraft
 deliveries  in  China  and/or  ramp  up  deliveries  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  our  expectation  of  delivery  timing  and  our  expectationregarding future gradual production rate increas
es could be impacted.92

 liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediatesites,
 including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed theserecorded
 amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or thediscovery
 of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios thatincludes the high end of a 
range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on ourexperience
 and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  bereasonab

 increase in the product warranty reserve during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by charges related to “pickle forks” on737NG
 aircraft.  During  2019,  we  detected  cracks  in  the  "pickle  forks",  a  frame  fitting  component  of  the  structure  connecting  the  wings  to  thefuselages
 of  737NG  aircraft.  We  notified  the  FAA,  which  issued  a  directive  requiring  that  certain  737NG  airplanes  be  inspected.  In  2019,  weestimated
 the number of aircraft  that  would have to be repaired in the future  and provisioned for the estimated  costs of completing  the repairs.During
 the first quarter of 2020, we recognized charges of $336 based on revised engineering and fleet utilization estimates as well as updatedrepair cost estimates. We
 cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing natureof the inspections and repairs and pend
ing the completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers
 that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-incommitments
 will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from othersources.
 The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic andairline
 industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only duringthe period specified in the agreement and req
uire advance notice by the customer.Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December 31, 2021 have expiration dates from 2022 through 2028. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, totalcontractual
 trade-in  commitments  were  $612  and  $950.  As  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  estimated  that  it  was  probable  we  would  beobligated
 to perform on certain of these commitments  with net amounts payable to customers  totaling $283 and $599, and the fair value of therelated trade-in aircraft was $283 and $580.

 that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralizationand interest rates, under which funding woul
d be provided.Funding Commitments
We have commitments to make additional capital contributions of $2
48 to joint ventures over the next six years.Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We
 have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  futureperformance
 on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately$3,634 and $4,238 as of December 31, 2021 a
nd 2020.Company Owned Life Insurance
McDonnell
 Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cashsurrender
 value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at thistime.
 We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, thecash
 surrender  value  was  $374  and  $395  and  the  total  loans  were  $360  and  $382.  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cashsurrender
 value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31,2021 and 2020.
BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
We
 have  recorded  earnings  charges  for  losses  on  a  number  of  fixed-price  development  contracts.  Fixed-price  development  work  is  inherentlyuncertain
 and  subject  to  significant  variability  in  estimates  of  the  cost  and  time  required  to  complete  the  work.  The  operational  and  technicalcomplexities
 of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger additional earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations orother financially signi
ficant exposure.95

In
 2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerialrefueling
 tankers.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  and  involves  highlycomplex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF
 has authorized seven low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 94 aircraft.The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approx
imately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021.At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $24
3 of capitalized precontract costs and $409 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers.Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor
 amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or providerefunds to the U.S. government.

 parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expirethrough 2036.
Industrial
 Revenue Bonds Industrial  Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction ofreal
 and  personal  property  at  our  St.  Louis  site.  Tax  benefits  associated  with  IRBs  include  a  twelve-year  property  tax  abatement  and  sales  taxexemption
 from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased theIRBs
 and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRBassets
 are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets andliabilities associated with the IRBs w

 In  conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourBCA
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relatingto pre-closing environm
ental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be assertedunder
 these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder these
 indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or areprobable and reasonably estima
ble, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 13.97

Many
 of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees transitioned to company-funded d
efined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.We fund
 our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately
 three-fourths of those participants who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees coveredby most United Auto Workers bargaining agreement
s, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the99

The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31,
2021 2020 2019 Discount rate:
Pension
2.80  %2.50 % 3.30 % Other postretirement benefits
2.50  %2.00 % 3.00 % Expected return on plan assets
6.30  %6.50 % 6.80 % Rate of compensation increase
4.30  %4.30 % 4.30 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans
5.00  %5.00 % 5.15 % The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The presentvalue of each plan’s benefits is calcu
lated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to historical returns, the assumption represents along-term,
 prospective  return.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  component  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  the  upcoming  plan  year  isdetermine
d based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of theaccounti
ng standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31,2021, the MRVA was approximately $4,773 less tha
n the fair market value of assets.Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:

 The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of ourstrategy
 is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assetswere
 reallocated  to  fixed  income.  The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investmentbenchmarks
 to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced frequently. The actual and target al
locations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:Actual Allocations

 income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments as well as Emerging Market, Structured, HighYield and
 Private Debt. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries andmarket capitalizations.
Private equity
 investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital,growth
 and special situation strategies. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through investments in alimited
 partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of realestate).
 Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are notlimited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.
Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to, directional, event driven, relative va
lue and long-short.103

Table of ContentsInvestment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired
 market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currencyexposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalanc
e the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.As
 a  percentage  of  total  pension  assets,  derivative  net  notional  amounts  were  33.4%  and  8.3%  for  fixed  income,  including  to-be-announcedmortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and (5.4%) and 0.4% for global eq
uity and commodities at December 31, 2021 and 2020.I
n November 2020, the Company contributed $3,000 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manageand liquidat
e the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $1,883 and $3,298 of our common stock as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Risk Management
 In  managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.Fair Value Measurements
 The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fairvalue
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3includes fair values estimated using sig
nificant unobservable inputs.104

Table of ContentsInputs used in developing fair valu
e estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at  their  net  asset  values  (NAVs)  that  are  calculated  by  theinvestment
 manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and areprimarily
 valued using an income  approach  with  inputs  that  include benchmark  yields,  swap curves,  cash  flow  analysis,  rating  agency  data  andinterdealer
 broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settleddaily and therefore reflected in the payables a
nd receivables portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAVs are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted futurecash
 flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarilyLPs),
 NAVs  are  adjusted  for  subsequent  cash  flows  and  significant  events.  Publicly  traded  REITs  and  infrastructure  stocks  are  valued  using  amarket
 approach  based  on  quoted  market  prices  of  identical  instruments.  Exchange-traded  commodities  futures  positions  are  reported  inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  incomevaluation methodology dep
ending on the specific type of security or instrument held.Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner,fund
 manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and arevalued
 in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as thepractical expedient for the valuations.

Cash Flows
Contributions
 Required  pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well as rules governing funding ofour
 non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3,000 in common stock tothe pension fund. We do not expect to make discretionary contributions to our pe
nsion plans in 2022.Estimated
 Future Benefit Payments The  table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets,including
 both  our share of the  benefit  cost  and the  participants’  share of  the cost,  which is funded by participant  contributions.  OPB paymentsreflect our portion only.

Certain

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby
 ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc
e benefit programs.Should
 we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will beentitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets base
d on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was $1,2
68, $1,351 and $1,533 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Note 17 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Share-Based Compensation
Our
 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,restricted
 stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards toour
 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 87,000,000.
Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during 2022.

Cash Flow Hedges
Our
 cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currencyforward
 contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreigncurrencies.
 Our  foreign  currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through  2031.  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-pricepurchase
 commitments  and  swaps  to  hedge  against  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes  for  commodities  used  in  production.  Our  commoditycontracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2029.

 on  our  portfolio  of  cash  flow  hedges,  we  expect  to  reclassify  gains  of  $22  (pre-tax)  out  of  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  intoearnings during the next 12 months.
We
 have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least fiveyears,
 our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  ourcounterparties
 could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commoditycontracts
 that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2021 was $7. At December 31, 2021,there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.
Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements
The
 fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determinedbased
 on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated
 using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measuredat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized usi

$120  ($98) $504 ($410) Investments, Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangi
ble assets were primarily valued using an income approach based onthe
 discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired customer financing assets includes operating leaseequipment
 and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group ofthird
 party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market tradesand
 other market  factors.  Management  reviews  the publications  quarterly  to assess the continued appropriateness  and consistency  with markettrends.
 Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when thefeatures
 or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected netsales price for the aircraft.
For
 Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2021, the following table presentsthe fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques a

 notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar termsto borrowers of similar credit quality. The
 fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on currentmarket yields. For
 our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowingcost
 derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flowmodels
 using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable toestimate

Various legal proceedin
gs, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.In
 addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings couldresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings inv
olve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and trebledamages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
 Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can alsobe
 suspended  or  debarred  from  government  contracts,  or  lose its  export  privileges,  based on the  results  of  investigations.  Except  as describedbelow, we believe,
117

Table of Contentsbased
 upon  current  information,  that  the  outcome  of  any  such  legal  proceeding,  claim,  or  government  dispute  and  investigation  will  not  have  amaterial
 effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess ofrecorded amounts in
 connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses inexcess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonab
ly estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.Multiple legal actions
 have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accidentof
 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivativelawsuit.
 Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237,before
 attorneys’ fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmentaland regulatory investigations and i
nquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX. Among these is an ongoing investigation by the Securities andExchang
e Commission, the outcome of which may be material. Other than with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Departmentof
 Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given thecurrent status of the pending lawsuits, investigations an
d inquiries related to the 737 MAX.On
 January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  ofJustice’s
 previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Underthe
 terms  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement,  we  agreed  to  the  filing  of  a  criminal  information  charging  the  Company  with  one  count  ofconspiracy
 to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will bedismissed
 after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires thatwe
 make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/orbeneficiaries
 of  those  who  died  in  the  Lion  Air  Flight  610  and  Ethiopian  Airlines  Flight  302  accidents;  and  (c)  $1,770  to  the  Company’s  airlinecustomers
 for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfiedthrough
 payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review ourcompliance
 program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internalcontrols
 mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the termsof
 the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund establishedto
 benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company’s airlinecustomers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer consid
erations.During 2019,
 we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and servicesoperations
 of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote anddevelop
 new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer’sfailure
 to  meet  certain  required  closing  conditions.  Embraer  has  disputed  our  right  to  terminate  the  agreements,  and  the  dispute  is  currently  inarbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.
Note 22 – Segment and Revenue Information

BCA
 develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercialaircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepte
d by the customer.BDS
 engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmannedmilitary
 aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  spaceexploration. BDS revenue is genera
lly recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.BGS
 provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  andgovernment customers
 worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue oncommercial
 spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts isgenerally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financ
ing solutions for our customers.While

Our
 share of income or loss from equity method investments was $40, $86 and $90, primarily in our BDS segment, for the years ended December31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Backlog
Our total backlog includes contracts
 that we and our customers are committed to perform. The value in backlog represents the estimated transactionprices
 on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue, primarily based onthe cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depend
ing on the applicable revenue recognition model.Our
 backlog at December 31, 2021 was $377,499. We expect approximately 17% to be converted to revenue through 2022 and approximately 74%through
 2025, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue due to787
 production issues and associated rework, timing of 737 MAX delivery resumption in China, timing of entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7and/or 737 MAX 10, and COVID-19 impacts.

 costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations at BGS. Pension costs areallocated
 to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employdifferent
 actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirementbenefit
 costs  are  allocated  to  business  segments  based  on  CAS,  which  is  generally  based  on  benefits  paid.  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustmentrepresents

Table of ContentsCost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As
 more  fully  described  in  Notes  1  and  13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  long-termcontracts as
 goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenueis
 recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involvesestimating
 the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount.Fixed-pric
e development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contractsare
 subject  to  significant  variability.  Due  to  the  technical  performance  requirements  in  many  of  these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenueestimates could occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.
Given
 the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and UnitedStates
 Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgmentsnecessary to
 estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment andrequired audit professionals with spec
ialized industry experience.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-2
5B PresidentialAircraft fixed-price development contracts included the follo
wing, among others:•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.•
We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and scheduleestimates, including the range and proba
bility of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.•
We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate management’s abilityto
 achieve the key cost and schedule estimates, as well as evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimatedcosts to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangibl
e or physical progress of the project.•
We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed  independent  expectations  ofreasonable outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and comp
ared our expectations to management’s estimates.•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop key estimates,including controls over the key data used in d
eveloping the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.•
We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial statement impact,including
 the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates, when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’sestimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.

Table of ContentsProgram Accounting Estimates for the 777X Program – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The
 introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification and production schedules. TheCompany uses program accounti
ng in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accountingrequires
 estimating  and  demonstrating  customer  demand  for  the  number  of  units  included  in  the  program  (program  accounting  quantity)  andestimating
 the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and revenuefor
 unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of reasonable outcomes. Additionally,the
 level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, resulting in delays in the timing of entryinto
 service  and corresponding  increases  in estimated  costs.  Changes to  the program  accounting  quantity  or  revenue and cost  estimates  couldoccur,
 resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  Auditing  the  estimated  revenues  and  costs  for  the  777X  program  involvedextensive
 audit  effort  and  required  audit  professionals  with  specialized  industry  experience  given  the  high  degree  of  complexity  and  subjectivityrelated to management’s estimates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our
 audit procedures over the estimated revenues and costs for the anticipated 777X program accounting quantity included the following, amongothers:
•
We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current salescampaigns, short and long-term market demand, and status of negotiations with in
dividual customers.•
We compared management’s estimate of market demand to external industry sources of expected demand.•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimatesrelated to the initial program accounting qua
ntity and revenue for unsold units.•
We  evaluated  management’s  ability  to  estimate  program  revenue  by  comparison  to  historical  estimates  and  actual  results  on  similarprograms.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates.•
We performed inquiries of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which mayaffect total estimated costs to achieve certification of the aircraft.
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolationof such data, and management’s judgment regardin
g the range of reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.126

Table of ContentsProgram Accounting Revenue Estimates for the 787 Program — Refer to Notes 1, 7, and 22 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Production
 quality issues for the 787 Program have resulted in increased risk associated with forecasted revenue estimates primarily due to thedifficulty in assessin
g the timeline for restarting 787 deliveries. The Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and marginfor
 each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of theaircraft
 included in the program’s accounting quantity. The timing of the Federal Aviation Administration's (“FAA”) approval to resume deliveries, theimpact
 to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be provided to customers for delivery delaysare
 key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased  estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  havereached
 or  are  expected  to  reach  a  delivery  delay  period  that  provides  the  customer  with  a  contractual  termination  right.  Due  to  continueduncertainty
 in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will reachthese
 contractual termination rights. Changes to the expected delivery resumption date could have a flowthrough impact and result in additionalconsideration
 to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787program
 involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity andsubjectivity related to management’s estimates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program include
d the following, among others:•
We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess whetherthe
 estimated  FAA  approval  and  delivery  resumption  date  represent  management’s  best  estimates  based  on  the  status  of  the  reworkactivity.
•
We  inquired  of  the  Company’s  management,  including  the  individuals  communicating  with  the  FAA,  to  assess  if  there  is  contradictoryinformation
 to that assumed by management related to the estimated timeline for rework completion or getting FAA approval to resumedeliveries.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s method for developing the deliveries schedule assumptions.•
We  inquired  of  the  Company’s  management,  including  individuals  responsible  for  sales  and  pricing,  to  evaluate  the  status  of  currentcontracts with customers and expected consideration to be provid
ed to customers.•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimatesrelated to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have deliv
ery delays.•
We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolationof such data, and management’s judgment regardin
g the range of reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.127

Table of ContentsLiabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding – Refer to Note 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
In
 2019, following two fatal 737 MAX accidents, the FAA and non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued orders suspending commercial operations of737 MAX aircraft (the “737 MAX Grounding”). Deliveries resumed in the U.S. in late 2020 fol
lowing rescission by the FAA of its grounding order.During
 2019, the Company recorded an initial liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind consideration it intendsto
 provide  to  customers  for  disruptions  related  to  the  737  MAX  Grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays.  This  liability  totaled  $2.9  billion  atDecember 31,
 2021 and is reflected in the financial statements in Accrued liabilities. Of the $2.9 billion, $2.2 billion has been contractually agreed towith
 customers. The liability represents the Company’s best estimate of future concessions and other consideration to its customers. To the extentnot contractually agreed upon, the estimate is based on i
ndividual negotiations with customers and the substance of such negotiations.The
 subjectivity of the estimate of approximately $0.7 billion relating to consideration that has not yet been contractually agreed to with customersinvolved extensive audit effort and a high d
egree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures associated with liabi
lities related to the 737 MAX Grounding included the following, among others:•
We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of consideration negotiationswith individual customers.
•
We obtained written representations from management concerning its intent to provide consideration to customers and the extent of thatconsideration.
•
We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, and, where possible, wecorroborated the significant assumptions with manag
ement outside of the accounting and finance organizations.•
We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential consideration as a result of the 737MAX Grounding.
•
We evaluated the terms of settlement agreements with customers for the allocation of value provided between consideration as a result ofthe 737 MAX Grounding and for consideration rel
ated to the impact of current economic conditions resulting from COVID-19.•
We evaluated delivery documents for 737 MAX deliveries for incremental value provided at delivery as potential consideration as a result ofthe 737 MAX G
rounding.•
We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss contingencies.•
We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737 MAX Grounding.128

ARTICLE IIntroduction
Plan Overview
The Boeing Company Executive Supplemental Savings Plan provides four separate components:
(i)
Extra Deferrals, the purpose of which is to provide a means by which eligible employees may defer payment of their base salaries and awards made under eligible incentive compensation plans (a traditional deferred compensation
benefit);
(ii)
the Restoration Benefit, the purpose of which is to restore the benefits of eligible employees under The Boeing Company 401(k) Retirement Plan (“Boeing 401(k),” previously named The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment
Plan), to the extent that these qualified plan benefits are limited by Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17);
(iii)
Executive Benefit, which includes Company Non-Elective Contributions, DC SERP Contributions, and historic Executive SSP+ Company Contributions; and
(iv)
DCP Accounts, which are the recordkeeping accounts established for Participants who participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company, which was frozen December 31, 2018 and merged into
this Plan effective January 1, 2022.
Plan History
The Plan (originally named, the Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company) (the “Plan”) was originally
established effective January 1, 1978, by The Boeing Company.
The Plan has been amended and restated from time to time since its original effective date, including on January 1, 2008, to comply
with section 409A of the Code.
As of January 1, 2022, the Plan is amended and restated to (A) reflect the merger of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees
of The Boeing Company with and into the Plan, (B) eliminate Restoration SSP+ Company Contributions and Executive SSP+
Company Contributions, (C) add a new Restoration True-Up Contribution, Incentive Matching Contribution and Company Non-
Elective Contribution, (D) simplify the mid-year enrollment provisions in the Participant Deferral component of the Plan, and (E)
make certain other changes.
Plan Status
The Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Code section 409A. It is also intended that the Plan shall be, in
part, an excess benefit plan as defined in section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), to the extent benefits are paid in excess of the limits imposed by Code section 415. To the extent any part of the Plan is not
an excess benefit plan, it is intended that the Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily
1

for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees undersections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

2.4
Authorized Period of Absence “Authorized Period of Absence” means a leave of absence approved by the Company.
2.5
Base Pay “Base Pay” means an Employee’s base pay (salary) from the Company. For clarity, this is the same as an Employee’s

such compensation under Code section 401(a)(17) and (B) prior to any deferrals of compensation made hereunder.
3

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Base Pay does not include amounts earned while an Employee isrepresented by a union with a collective bargaining agreement covering such Employee that does not provide for
participation in the Plan.

2.8
Beneficiary “Beneficiary” means the person or persons designated by a Participant to receive distributions from the Plan upon the

the Beneficiary shall be the person or persons designated by a Participant under the Boeing 401(k) to receive any benefit
payable from the Boeing 401(k) upon the death of the Participant. If no effective designation is on file under this Plan or the

ARTICLE III Participant Deferrals
 3.1
Annual Participation and Deferrals – Eligibility The Plan provides Eligible Employees with two ways to defer Compensation on a pre-tax basis– the Extra Deferral
component and the Restoration Deferral component. Only Eligible Employees will be permitted to participate.
Elections to take effect with respect to a full Plan Year will generally be made during the annual Election Period.
(A)
Extra Deferral Component An individual is an Eligible Employee for purposes of making an Extra Deferral Election for a Plan Year if he or she is an
Employee paid on a U.S. dollar-based payroll as of the Eligibility Determination Date.
In any Extra Deferral Election, an Eligible Employee may defer up to a maximum of: (i) in the case of Base Pay Deferrals,
50% of his or her Base Pay payable in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies, (ii) in the case of Cash Incentive
Deferrals, 100% of his or her Cash Incentive earned in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies (even if payable
in a subsequent Plan Year), and/or (iii) in the case of Vested Performance Award Deferrals, 100% of his or her Performance
Awards granted in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies, which grant generally covers the next three (3) Plan
Years (even if payable in a subsequent Plan Year). For clarity, Extra Deferrals will be made without regard to the Code
section 401(a)(17) and 415(c) limitations.
Extra Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable, or as
soon thereafter as administratively feasible.
(B)
Restoration Deferral Component In any Restoration Deferral Election, an Eligible Employee may elect a deferral percentage up to the maximum percentage of
his or her Base Pay that the Employee can elect to contribute on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth basis under the Boeing
401(k). Restoration Deferrals will be made from the Eligible Employee’s Base Pay only after either: (1) Base Pay for the
applicable Plan Year reaches the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, for such Plan Year or (2) the
Participant’s annual additions under the Boeing 401(k) for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code
section 415(c), as indexed.
Restoration Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable,
or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.
11

3.2Mid-Year Participation– Eligibility To the extent permitted by and in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Administrator, an Employee who is Newly
Eligible during a Plan Year may elect (A) Extra Deferrals up to a maximum of 50% of the Base Pay earned and payable in
each full regular pay period commencing after the end of the Election Period (or such other date determined by the
Administrator in accordance with Code Section 409A) for the remainder of the applicable Plan Year, (B) Restoration
Deferrals (if the Eligible Employee satisfies the criteria of this Section) and (C) the form and time of distribution of the
Account with respect to such Plan Year, as permitted by Section 6.1. Such mid-year elections will be made during the mid-
year Election Period. Different mid-year election rules applied with respect to Plan Years prior to January 1, 2022. Mid-year
elections cannot be made for Cash Incentive Deferrals or Vested Performance Award Deferrals.
In any mid-year Restoration Deferral election, an Eligible Employee will be permitted to make a Restoration Deferral
election with respect to Base Pay earned and payable in each full regular pay period commencing after the end of the
Election Period for the remainder of such Plan Year up to the maximum percentage of his or her Base Pay that the Employee
can elect to contribute on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth basis under the Boeing 401(k) for such period. Restoration
Deferrals will be made from the Eligible Employee’s Base Pay only after either: (1) Base Pay for the applicable Plan Year
reaches the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, for such Plan Year or (2) the Participant’s annual additions
under the Boeing 401(k) for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code section 415(c), as indexed.
3.3
Deferral Elections An Eligible Employee may elect to defer a percentage of his or her eligible Compensation for a Plan Year (or portion of a
Plan Year in the case of a mid-year enrollment) on a pre-tax basis by executing and delivering one or more timely Deferral
Election(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3. The type and amount of eligible Compensation that may be
deferred is described in Section 3.1 (for annual deferrals) and Section 3.2 (for mid-year deferrals).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent any Eligible Employee had in effect an active (A) Restoration
Deferral Election under this Plan immediately prior to its amendment and restatement as of January 1, 2019 and does not
timely change such Restoration Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year beginning on January 1, 2019, such Eligible
Employee shall be deemed to have continued such active Restoration Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year
beginning on January 1, 2019 and (except as otherwise provided below for Employees who cease to be Eligible Employees)
future Plan Years on an “evergreen basis” unless and until such Eligible Employee changes such Restoration Deferral
Election in accordance with this Section 3.3; or (B) election to defer compensation under the DCP immediately prior to that
plan’s amendment and restatement as of January 1, 2019 and fails either to make a timely Extra Deferral Election or to
indicate affirmatively that he or she does not wish to make an Extra Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year beginning
on January 1, 2019, such Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have made an Extra Deferral Election identical to such
election to defer compensation under the DCP with respect to the Plan Year beginning on January 1, 2019 and (except as
otherwise provided below for Employees who cease to be Eligible Employees) future Plan Years on an “evergreen basis”
unless and until such Eligible Employee changes such Extra Deferral Election in accordance with this Section 3.3.
12

(A)Deferral Elections An Eligible Employee’s Deferral Election(s) must be made in accordance with rules established by the Administrator.
An Eligible Employee may make separate Extra Deferral Elections with respect to Base Pay, Cash Incentive and
Performance Awards and/or a separate Restoration Deferral Election with respect to Base Pay, each to the extent
described in Section 3.1 or 3.2, as applicable.
Eligible Employees may make new Deferral Elections for each succeeding Plan Year. An Eligible Employee’s
Deferral Election will be “evergreen” – it will carry-over from Plan Year to Plan Year (or from a partial Plan Year to
the subsequent Plan Year in the case of a mid-year enrollment) unless it is changed or cancelled in accordance with
rules established by the Administrator or as otherwise provided in this Plan.
In the case of an Employee who ceases to be an Eligible Employee during the Plan Year (e.g., due to a reclassification
as other than E-Series Payroll or Separation from Service) the Employee’s Deferral Election(s) shall remain in effect
with respect to the Plan Year in which the Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee, but will automatically be
cancelled with respect to future Deferrals (i.e., Deferrals with respect to subsequent Plan Years).
(B)
Distribution Elections Deferral Elections will include an option to elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to the Participant
Deferrals, as described in Article VI, as applicable.
Any election made as to the form and timing of distribution with respect to Restoration Deferrals will apply to the
Participant’s entire Restoration Account.
(C)
Timing and Irrevocability of Elections In general, the Deferral Election must be filed during the applicable Election Period.
Deferral Elections with respect to a full Plan Year will generally become irrevocable as of the end of the Election
Period. Deferral Elections with respect to a mid-year participation will become irrevocable as of the last day of the
mid-year Election Period.
Once Deferral Elections become irrevocable they generally may not be modified with respect to the Plan Year, and
the Compensation, to which they apply. Likewise, an Employee who makes a Restoration Deferral Election will be
subject to restrictions on mid-year contribution election changes under the Boeing 401(k), in accordance with the
terms of the Boeing 401(k).
See Section 3.4 for a limited exception to the general rule on the irrevocability of Deferral Elections, in the event of
Unforeseeable Emergency.
13

(D)No Mid-Year Elections Except as provided in this Article III, an Employee who becomes Newly Eligible during a Plan Year (including as a
result of a salary increase) will not be eligible to make Participant Deferrals during such Plan Year.
3.4
Cancellation of Deferral Election Due to Unforeseeable Emergency Notwithstanding the irrevocability rule described in Section 3.3, a Participant will be permitted to cancel an existing Deferral
Election with regard to a Plan Year during that Plan Year, if the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, as
determined by the Administrator.
If a Participant has elected and received a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 6.1(I), the
Participant will be deemed to have elected to cancel his or her Deferral Election(s) that relate to Base Pay for the remainder
of the applicable Plan Year.
3.5
Crediting of Deferrals to Account In all cases, Participant Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise
have been payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.
14

ARTICLE IV Company Contributions
4.1
Restoration Matching Contributions A Participant who defers Base Pay pursuant to a Restoration Deferral Election under Section 3.3 will be credited with a
Restoration Matching Contribution from the Company related to such Restoration Deferrals. This Restoration Matching
Contribution will equal a percentage (determined based on the matching contribution formula applicable to the Participant
under the Boeing 401(k) for the Plan Year) of the Participant’s Restoration Deferrals for the Plan Year.
Restoration Matching Contributions under this Plan apply only to Participant Deferrals of Base Pay made pursuant to a
Restoration Deferral Election. Restoration Matching Contributions will not be made with respect to Participant Deferrals of
Base Pay made pursuant to an Extra Deferral Election.
An Eligible Employee must make a timely Restoration Deferral Election, as described in Section 3.3, to become eligible to
participate in the Restoration Matching Contribution component of the Plan. Distribution elections are discussed in Article
VI.
Restoration Matching Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that the underlying Restoration
Deferrals are credited to the Participant’s Account.
4.2
Restoration True-Up Contributions The Company may choose to make a Restoration True-Up Contribution to this Plan on behalf of certain Eligible Employees.
The Restoration True-Up Contribution, if any, will be equal to the portion of the matching contribution true-up that would
have been made to the Boeing 401(k) for the Eligible Employee but for the limitations imposed by Code section 415(c), as
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided that no Company Non-Elective Contribution will be made if the
Employee terminates from employment prior to the last business day of the Plan Year for any reason other than retirement
(for this purpose, after attaining age 55 with 10 years of service or after attaining age 62 with 1 year of service), disability
(for this purpose, meaning the Eligible Employee is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration), layoff,
or death.
An Eligible Employee for purposes of this Section 4.2 need not make (or be eligible to make) a timely Restoration Deferral
Election for a Plan Year in order to receive an allocation of Restoration True-Up Contributions for such Plan Year. Available
distribution elections are discussed in Article VI.
The Restoration True-Up Contribution, if any, will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that true-up

Participant under the Boeing 401(k) for the Plan Year) of the Participant’s Cash Incentive Deferrals for the Plan Year.
An Eligible Employee must make a timely Cash Incentive Deferral Election, as described in Section 3.3, to become eligible
for the related Incentive Matching Contributions. Distribution elections are discussed in Article VI.
Incentive Matching Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that the underlying Cash Incentive
Deferrals are credited to the Participant’s Account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Matching Contribution will be made with respect to any Cash Incentive
Deferrals that are paid (or, but for the Participant’s Cash Incentive Deferral election, would be paid) after the date the
Participant terminates from employment.
4.4
Company Non-Elective Contributions (Component of the Executive Benefit) The Company may make a Company Non-Elective Contribution to this Plan with respect to a Plan Year on behalf of certain
Eligible Employees; provided that no Company Non-Elective Contribution will be made if the Employee terminates from
employment prior to the last business day of the Plan Year for any reason other than retirement (for this purpose, after
attaining age 55 with 10 years of service or after attaining age 62 with 1 year of service), disability (for this purpose, meaning
the Eligible Employee is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration), layoff, or death.
The Company Non-Elective Contribution for a Plan Year will equal a percentage of the eligible Participant’s Compensation
paid by the Company during the applicable pay periods within such Plan Year. This percentage will be equal to the Company
discretionary non-elective contribution percentage for which the Participant is eligible for such pay period under the Boeing
401(k).
An Eligible Employee for purposes of this Section 4.4 need not make (or be eligible to make) deferrals to the Plan in order to

16

4.5DC SERP Contributions (Component of the Executive Benefit) (A)
Eligibility An Employee is eligible to receive DC SERP Contributions with respect to a Plan Year for so long as he or she satisfies the
conditions in either (i) or (ii) below. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no DC SERP Contributions will be
made for: (i) any elected officer on or after January 1, 2020, or (ii) any Employee who is hired or promoted onto the E-Series
Payroll on or after January 1, 2020.
(i)
Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (i) if:
(a)
The Employee was hired on or after January 1, 2009, but before January 1, 2020, (b)
The Employee is on the E-Series Payroll in level E-1, E-2, or E-3, and was on the E-Series Payroll (in any level E-1 through E-5) as of December 31, 2019,
(c)
The Employee is not an elected officer of the Company, and (d)
The Employee is ineligible to accrue benefits under any defined benefit plan maintained by the Controlled Group.
(ii)
Hired Before January 1, 2009 An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (ii) if:
(a)
The Employee was hired before January 1, 2009, (b)
The Employee was on the E-series Payroll (in any level E-1 through E-5) as of December 31, 2019, and
(c)
The Employee is not an elected officer of the Company. For purposes of determining eligibility for the DC SERP, the term “hired” generally refers to an Employee’s most recent date
of hire or rehire with the Company, except as provided below, regardless of the date on which the Employee joins the E-
Series Payroll.
For this purpose:
(a)
Approved Leaves of Absence . A return to the Controlled Group directly from an approved leave of absence, without incurring a termination of employment, is not considered a rehire.
For this purpose, an Employee’s period of employment with ULA or USA will be considered an
approved leave of absence, to the extent that the Employee first transferred directly from the
Controlled Group to ULA or USA and subsequently transferred directly from ULA or USA back to the
Controlled Group.
17

(b)Transfers . A transfer of employment among members of the Controlled Group, without interruption, is not considered a rehire and, accordingly, the most recent date of hire or rehire for purposes of
determining such a transferred Employee’s eligibility would be the Employee’s most recent date of
hire or rehire with the Company’s controlled group member from which the Employee transferred.
(c)
Layoffs . A rehire to the Controlled Group following a termination of employment due to layoff generally will not be treated as a rehire, if rehire occurs within six years of the layoff event. However,
a laid off Employee who commences a retirement benefit during this six year period will be treated as
a rehire if he or she later rehires to the Controlled Group.
An individual who became a “group-acquired employee” after September 30, 2008 and before January
1, 2009 will be deemed to have been hired on or after January 1, 2009, for purposes of determining
eligibility to receive a contribution for periods on and after January 1, 2009. No contribution will be
paid prior to January 1, 2009. For this purpose, a “group-acquired employee” refers to an employee of
the Company who became such as an immediate or ultimate result of a merger to which the Company
was a party, or of the acquisition by the Company of all or part of the assets, businesses or capital
stock of another corporation or firm.
(B)
DC SERP Participation An Eligible Employee will be a Participant in the DC SERP for the period(s), if any, that the Employee satisfies the
eligibility conditions in Section 4.5(A).
(C)
DC SERP Contributions Each Participant eligible for DC SERP Contributions shall be entitled to contributions under this Plan as described below.
(i)
Payroll Contributions Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Base Pay and Cash Incentive otherwise
would be payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.
(a)
Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019) will
receive a DC SERP contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant’s Base Pay
and Cash Incentive, for each applicable pay period. The Contribution Credit for a pay period is determined by
the Participant’s level as of such pay period as follows:
(1)
2%, for a Participant at level E-2 through E-3.18

(2)4%, for a Participant at level E-1.If a Participant changes levels during a pay period, the Participant’s level as in effect on the last day of the pay
period will apply. For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant’s Base Pay and Cash
Incentive will be counted solely to the extent that (1) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll during the
applicable pay period or (2) such Cash Incentive is paid after a Participant’s termination of employment from
the Controlled Group but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular paycheck.
(b)
Hired Before January 1, 2009 A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(ii) (Hired Before January 1, 2009) will receive a DC SERP
contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant’s Base Pay and Cash Incentive,
for each applicable pay period. For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant’s Base
Pay and Cash Incentive will be counted solely to the extent that (1) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll
during the applicable pay period or (2) such Cash Incentive is paid after a Participant’s termination of
employment from the Controlled Group but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular
paycheck.
The Contribution Credit will equal the sum of (i) and, if applicable, (ii):

her legacy Executive SSP+ Company Contribution Account that is attributable to Executive SSP+ Company Contributions
made on and after January 1, 2017, if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Controlled Group or
within five (5) years after termination of such employment:
(A)
The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests. For purposes of this Plan, “other similar unlawful acts
against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests” shall include any other unlawful act
(i) committed against the Controlled Group, or the interests of the Controlled Group, including, but not limited to, a
governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Controlled Group, or a customer of the
Controlled Group, or (ii) affecting the Controlled Group or the interests of the Controlled Group, in such a manner that
is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Controlled Group or the interests of the
Controlled Group, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
(B)
The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or otherwise, which the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is
“engaging in competition” with any significant aspect of Controlled Group business. For purposes of this Plan,
“engaging in competition” shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee
of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition
with any Controlled Group business or that takes a position adverse
21

to any Controlled Group business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that isdetermined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Controlled Group, all as
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
(C)
The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (or successor position thereto), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Controlled Group’s

protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in
administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.
(E)
The Participant uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Controlled Group. Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government
agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.
To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of such portion of his or her Executive SSP+
Company Contribution Account, the Administrator will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the
Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover the amount distributed from such Executive SSP+ Company Contribution
Account. The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent
jurisdiction. However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these
provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable,
and as so amended shall continue in effect.
In addition, the Administrator will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any Executive SSP+ Company
Contribution Account attributable to Executive SSP+ Company Contributions made on and after January 1, 2017, which are
attributable to an incentive award that the Controlled Group seeks to recover under the clawback provision of any plan
providing Cash Incentive.
22

5.6DC SERP Vesting No payments shall be made from a Participant’s DC SERP Account except to the extent such Participant is vested in his or
her DC SERP Account.
(A)
General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019) will vest 100%
in his or her DC SERP Account component(s) covered under this subsection (A) on the date the Participant satisfies
the conditions in any of (i), (ii) or (iii) below.
(i)
The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 for a period of 36 consecutive months. (For Participants with prior periods of employment, a period of consecutive months before January 1,
2009 on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 will be counted for purposes of determining
whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has been satisfied.)
(ii)
The Participant dies while an Employee. (iii)
The Participant is laid off from a position at level E-1 through E-3 and is eligible for benefits under The Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan.
See subsection  (C) below for additional vesting rules for these Participants based on age and Service.
(B)
General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired Before January 1, 2009 A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(ii) (Hired Before January 1, 2009) will vest 100% in his or her DC SERP
Account component covered under this subsection (B) on the date the Participant satisfies the conditions in any of (i),
(ii) or (iii) below.
(i)
The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months. For a Participant on the E-Series Payroll as of January 1, 2016, a period of consecutive months before January 1, 2016 on the E-
Series Payroll will be counted for purposes of determining whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has
been satisfied.
(ii)
The Participant is fully vested under the PVP and/or BSS Plan, as applicable, and dies while an Employee before his or her DC SERP Account commences payment under this Plan.
(iii)
The Participant is laid off from an E-Series position and is eligible for benefits under The Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan.
23

(C)Special Vesting Rules for Participants Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 with 55/10 or 62/1 Special vesting rules apply for a Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2019) who has attained either (i) or (ii) while employed by the Controlled Group.
(i)
Age 55 with 10 years of Service, or (ii)
Age 62 with one year of Service. This Participant will be 100% vested in the portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in Section 4.5(C)(i)
(Payroll Contributions) after he or she has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months.
This Participant will vest ratably in the portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in Section 4.5(C)(ii) (One-
Time Contribution), if any, at the rate of 1/36 for each consecutive month that the Participant is on the E-Series
Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3, starting with the date on which the Participant was first promoted to the E-
Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3. This pro rata vesting rule is not intended to preclude the acceleration of
vesting under subsections (A)(ii) (death) or (iii) (layoff) above, if applicable.
(D)
Authorized Period of Absence For purposes of this Section, an Authorized Period of Absence from the E-Series Payroll will count as a period on the
E-Series Payroll, and an Authorized Period of Absence from a position at level E-1 through E-3 will count as a period
at these levels.
If an Employee ceases to be at the applicable level for any reason other than an Authorized Period of Absence, and
the Employee later returns to a position at the applicable level, these non-consecutive periods of service will not be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 36-consecutive month requirement has been met.
(E)
Transfers to and from ULA and USA For purposes of computing vesting for a Participant who transfers employment directly from the Controlled Group to
ULA or USA, uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive in a position at a comparable level will be
credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described herein, provided that the Participant transfers
directly from the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3 if applicable) at the Controlled Group to
comparable executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable. ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting
under this Plan for any period following the Participant’s removal from this executive status. For purposes of
computing vesting for a participant who transfers employment directly from ULA or USA to the Controlled Group,
uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive at a position comparable to the E-Series Payroll (or a position at
level E-1 through E-3, if applicable) will be credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described
herein, provided that the Participant transfers directly from this executive status at ULA or USA to a position at a
comparable level at the Controlled Group. ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting under this Plan
for any period
24

prior to the Participant’s attainment of this executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable.(F)
Impact of Separation from Service/Transfer (i)
Payroll Contributions . If a Participant Separates from Service (other than due to an Authorized Period of Absence) or transfers off of the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3, if applicable) 
before becoming 100% vested in the payroll contribution portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in
Section 4.5(C)(i)(A) and/or (i)(B), as applicable, the Participant will forfeit all rights to the nonvested portion
of his or her DC SERP Account attributable to the period prior to his or her Separation from Service or
transfer. To the extent any benefit under this Plan becomes vested during an Authorized Period of Absence
that continues after a deemed Separation from Service, it will remain subject to the payment timing rules
under Section 6.1.
(ii)
One-Time Contributions . If a Participant stops accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements (such as due to a Separation from Service) after becoming partially vested in the one-time
contribution portion of the DC SERP Account, under subsection (C) above, and the Participant subsequently
resumes accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements, the DC SERP Account
accrued after such resumption will not be vested until the Participant satisfies the requirements of
subsection (A) or (C) above following such resumption.
(iii)
Multiple DC SERP Account Components . Separate vesting requirements apply to each component of a Participant’s DC SERP Account described in Sections 4.4(C)(i)(a), (i)(b), and (ii). This means that a
Participant who has accrued more than one DC SERP Account component (such as, due to a Separation from
Service and subsequent rehire) must satisfy the vesting requirements applicable to each such component. If a
Participant Separates from Service 
after  becoming 100% vested in a particular DC SERP Account component, the Participant will be fully vested in any additional accruals under the same DC SERP Account component
following rehire or return (even if the Participant fails to be at the applicable pay level for 36 consecutive
months following rehire or return). The Participant will not, however, be fully vested in any amounts accrued
under a 
different  DC SERP Account component unless and until the corresponding applicable vesting requirements under this Section 5.5 otherwise have been satisfied.
See Section 7.4 regarding missing participants and improper credits, Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment, and
Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan. Any amounts forfeited hereunder will not later be reinstated.
25

5.7DC SERP Forfeiture Rules The Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, that a Participant will forfeit any part or all of his or her DC SERP
Account if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Controlled Group or within five (5) years after
termination of such employment:
(A)
The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests. For purposes of this Plan, “other similar unlawful
acts against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests” shall include any other unlawful act
(i) committed against the Controlled Group, or the interests of the Controlled Group, including, but not limited to, a
governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Controlled Group, or a customer of the
Controlled Group, or (ii) affecting the Controlled Group or the interests of the Controlled Group, in such a manner
that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Controlled Group or the interests of the
Controlled Group, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
(B)
The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or otherwise, which the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is
“engaging in competition” with any significant aspect of Controlled Group business. For purposes of this Plan,
“engaging in competition” shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee
of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition
with any Controlled Group business or that takes a position adverse to any Controlled Group business, regardless of
the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in
conflict with the interests of the Controlled Group, all as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
(C)
The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (or equivalent but for title), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Controlled Group’s
employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Controlled Group,
or to breach any contract with the Controlled Group, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the
Participant or any third party.
(D)
The Participant disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Controlled Group, its products, or its employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical. Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally
protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in
administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.
(E)
With respect to contributions made to the Plan on and after January 1, 2017, the Participant uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Controlled Group. Nothing in
this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or
26

statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of his or her DC SERP Account, the Administrator
will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover
such benefit. The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent
jurisdiction. However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these
provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable,
and as so amended shall continue in effect.
In addition, the Administrator will, in all appropriate circumstances, require forfeiture or reimbursement of any portion of a
DC SERP Account attributable to an incentive award that the Controlled Group seeks to recover under the clawback
provision of any plan providing Cash Incentive.
27

ARTICLE VI Distributions
6.1
Form and Timing of Distribution (A)
Extra Deferral Account A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her Extra Deferral Account as
described below, subject to the cash-out rule in subsection (E) below. This distribution election must be made at the
same time the Participant makes his or her first Extra Deferral Election.
If a Participant fails to make a timely election with regard to the 
timing  of payment of his or her Extra Deferral Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in January of the first Plan Year
following the Participant’s Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)). If a Participant fails to make a timely
election with regard to the 
form  of payment of his or her Extra Deferral Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in a lump sum.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent the Participant had in effect a distribution election
under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company immediately prior to January 1, 2019
and fails to make a timely election with regard to the timing or form of payment of his or her Extra Deferral Account,
such distribution election shall apply automatically to any future deferrals of the same type credited under this Plan
and such Participant will only be permitted to change such deemed election in accordance with subsection (F) below.
A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her entire
Extra Deferral Account after the initial Extra Deferral Election is made (or deemed made), to the extent permitted and
in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.
(B)
Restoration Account A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her Restoration Account as described
below, subject to the cash-out rule in subsection (E) below. This distribution election must be made at the same time
the Participant makes his or her first Restoration Deferral Election or, if earlier, during the enrollment period
immediately preceding the first year with respect to which the Participant receives a Company contribution to his or
her Restoration Account. Any election made as to the form and timing of distribution will apply to the Participant’s
entire Restoration Account, including the Restoration True-Up Contributions and the Restoration SSP+ Company
Contributions made for Plan Years prior to January 1, 2022, if any.
If a Participant fails to make a timely election with regard to the 
timing  of payment of his or her Restoration Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in January of the first Plan Year following the
Participant’s Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)). If a Participant fails to make a timely election with
regard to the 
form  of payment of his or her Restoration Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in a lump sum.
28

A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her entireRestoration Account after the initial Restoration Deferral Election is made (or deemed made), to the extent permitted
and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.
(C)
Executive Benefit Account No initial distribution elections are permitted or required with regard to a Participant’s Executive Benefit Account, to
which is credited Company Non-Elective Contributions, Executive SSP+ Company Contributions and DC SERP
Contributions. Rather, a Participant is deemed to have elected to receive his or her Executive Benefit Account in a
lump sum, payable in January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)).
A Participant may change his or her deemed distribution election with respect to his or her Executive Benefit Account
to the extent permitted and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.
(D)
Timing and Form of Distribution (i)
Lump Sum Distribution The lump sum distribution option is a single lump sum payment that will be made in the later of: (i) January of
the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the
Participant’s attainment of a specified age (subject to subsection (E) below), as elected by the Participant
under this Section 6.1 (in each case subject to subsection (H) below). Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (H) below, the amount of such distribution will equal the value of the Participant’s Account as of
the first business day of January of the Plan Year of payment (or such other distribution valuation date as is
specified by the Administrator), and no additional interest or earnings will be credited thereafter.
(ii)    
Installment Payment The installment payment option is a series of annual installment payments for a period between 2 and 15
years, as elected by the Participant under this Section 6.1. Annual installment payments, if elected, will begin
in the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first
Plan Year following the Participant’s attainment of a specified age (subject to (E) below), as elected by the
Participant under this Section 6.1 (in each case subject to subsection (H) below). Payments will continue to be
made each January thereafter until the full amount of the benefit has been paid.
The amount payable to the Participant each year shall be computed by dividing the balance in the Account (or
the applicable portion of the Account) as of the first business day of January of the Plan Year in which
payment is to be made (or such other distribution valuation date as is specified by the Administrator) by the
number of years remaining in the distribution period. No additional earnings or interest will be credited to a
Participant’s account with respect to an installment payment after the valuation date used to determine the
amount of such payment. See
29

Section 6.1(E) below for application of the cash-out rule to installment payments.(E)
Cash-outs Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the six-month delay in payment for Specified Employees under
subsection (H), if a Participant has elected to receive installments and his or her remaining Account balance is
$10,000 or less upon any scheduled payment date (excluding the balance of the DCP Account), the entire remaining
balance will be paid as one final installment payment at that time.
(F)
Changes to Distribution Election or Deemed Election A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed election) after the initial distribution election becomes
effective (or deemed effective) only once with regard to each of the following subaccounts: the Participant’s
Restoration Account, Executive Benefit Account, Extra Deferral Account, and DCP Account (Deferrals) and DCP
Account (Match).
Such election must change the time of payment (consistent with the requirement of clause (iii) below) and may
change the form of payment (from lump sum to installments, or vice versa). Subject to the following paragraph, such
election may be made at any time and need not be made during an annual enrollment period. If an election change is
made by an Eligible Employee during the annual enrollment period, it can be changed during such period and the last
change on file (if any) as of the end of the annual enrollment period will be irrevocable. If the election change is made
by an Eligible Employee outside of the annual enrollment period or at any time by a Participant who is not an Eligible
Employee, such election change will be irrevocable when made.
To the extent any such changes would defer commencement of any portion of the Participant’s Restoration Account,
Executive Benefit Account, Extra Deferral Account or DCP Account beyond both age 70½ and Separation from
Service, the changes will not be effective.
(i)
A new distribution election must be submitted in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Administrator at least 12 months before the existing scheduled distribution date under the applicable subaccount.
(ii)
The revised distribution election must not take effect for at least 12 months after it is made. (iii)
The new distribution election must provide for an additional deferral period of at least 5 years beyond the original distribution date.
In no event can installment payments be changed or revoked once they have begun. In all cases, payments will be
made in January (subject to subsection (H)).
(G)
Distributions At Age 70½ Payment of benefits under this Plan will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the
Participant both attains (or would have attained) age 70½ and is Separated from Service. Payment of benefits for
Participants actively employed beyond age 70½ will begin no later than the first
30

January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. Subject to subsection (D), anyelection made by a Participant to the contrary will not be effective.
(H)
Specified Employees Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Article VI, a Specified Employee will not receive any
distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service.
Subject to subsection (F) above, the Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected (or
deemed elected) under subsection (A), (B), or (C) above, as applicable. This distribution will be made or commence
as of the latest of:
(1)
the time elected (or deemed elected) under subsection (A), (B), or (C), as applicable, (2)
the month following completion of the six-month waiting period (for Specified Employees who Separate from Service between July 1 and December 31), and
(3)
January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service (for Specified Employees who Separate from Service between January 1 and June 30).
If a Participant has elected installments, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive
year until the Account is exhausted.
For payments occurring other than in January, the amount of the distribution will be determined based on the value of
the Participant’s Account as of the first business day of the month that payment will be made (or such other
distribution valuation date as is specified by the Administrator). No additional earnings or interest will be credited to
a Participant’s account with respect to a payment after the valuation date used to determine the amount of such
payment.
In the event of a Specified Employee’s death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to
apply. The Specified Employee’s benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 6.2 (Death Benefits) below.
(I)
Distribution Due to Unforeseeable Emergency A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Extra Deferral
Account, DCP Account, Restoration Account, and his or her Executive SSP+ Company Contribution Account
immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or
Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant or Beneficiary may not receive a distribution of his or
her DC SERP Account solely in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, even if fully vested.
The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need,
including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the
Administrator.
31

6.2Death Benefits If a Participant dies before his or her entire Account has been distributed, the remaining balance will be distributed to his or
her Beneficiary in accordance with the Participant’s election or deemed election as to form and timing filed with the
Administrator with regard to such Account(s). Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time (or as soon as
practicable following the Company’s receipt of a notice of the Participant’s death) and in the same form as the payment that
otherwise would have been made to the Participant.
If a Beneficiary dies after the Participant, but before receiving the payment of all amounts due hereunder, then the unpaid
amounts will be paid to the individual(s) designated (in accordance with the rules established by the Administrator) by the
Beneficiary as his or her beneficiary(ies), or if no such designation has been made (or if such individual(s) do(es) not survive
to receive payment), then such unpaid amounts will be paid to the Beneficiary’s estate, in a single lump sum, as soon as
practicable after the Beneficiary’s death.
32

6.3Rehires and Authorized Periods of Absence/Reduced Level of Services This Section 6.3 addresses the form and timing of payment for a Participant who is rehired by the Company following a
Separation from Service, or who remains employed after a Separation from Service has occurred (for example, due to an
extended Authorized Period of Absence or due to reduced level of services).
In the event that a Participant forfeits a nonvested DC SERP Account upon a Separation from Service, this benefit will not be
restored upon rehire. This rule applies regardless of whether the Participant satisfies the vesting criteria under Section 5.5
following rehire.
(A)
After Commencing Benefits This subsection (A) applies to a Participant who has received or begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he
or she has experienced a Separation from Service and has attained the specified age (if applicable).
(i)
Rehires . Installment payments that commenced prior to the Participant’s rehire with respect to Participant Deferrals made and Company Contributions received before the Participant’s Separation from Service (“Old
Account”) will not be suspended by reason of the Participant’s rehire. This Old Account will continue to be
paid until exhausted, without regard to the period of rehire.
Participant Deferrals made and Company Contributions received attributable to periods after the date of rehire
(“New Account”) will remain subject to the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to
the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(F)), without
regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire. As a result, the New Account will be
distributed in January following the Participant’s Separation from Service after rehire (subject to any 6-month
delay for Specified Employees), in the form selected under the original distribution election or deemed
election. This is because the Participant already has attained the specified age under Section 6.1(D) but has not
yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Account.
(ii)
Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services . To the extent a Participant made additional Participant Deferrals or received additional Company Contributions while on an Authorized Period of
Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services that constituted a Separation from Service under
Code section 409A, such Participant Deferrals made and Company Contributions received (to the extent
vested) will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they are made, in
accordance with the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election. This is because the
Participant has already satisfied the conditions for payment under Section 6.1(D); namely, he or she has
attained the specified age and has experienced a Separation from Service attributable to such Participant
Deferrals made and contributions received.

(B)Before Commencing Benefits This subsection (B) applies to a Participant who has not begun receiving benefits under the Plan.
(i)
Rehires . The rehired Participant’s Old Account, to the extent vested, will be distributed in accordance with the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under
Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(F)). This means that, for example, if the
Participant’s original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments)
payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 6.1(D), then the Participant’s Old
Account (to the extent vested) will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if so elected) in January
following the year in which he or she attains the specified age, even if the Participant has not had a subsequent
Separation from Service after rehire. This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the
specified age after the initial Separation from Service, but is rehired before benefits actually begin.
The Participant’s New Account will remain subject to the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed
election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in
Section 6.1(F)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire, as described in
Section 6.3(A) above. As a result, the New Account will be distributed either (i) in January following the
Participant’s Separation from Service 
after rehire , or (ii) in January following both the Participant’s Separation from Service 
after rehire  and after attainment of the specified age, in accordance with the original distribution election or deemed election. This is because the Participant has not yet experienced a Separation
from Service attributable to the New Account.
(ii)
Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services . Any Participant Deferrals made or Company Contributions received during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services (to
the extent vested) will be distributed in accordance with the Participant’s earlier distribution election or
deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in
Section 6.1(F)). This means that, for example, if the Participant’s original distribution election selected
benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age
under Section 6.1(D), then any Participant Deferrals made and contributions received during an Authorized
Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if
so elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age.
34

This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age while on an AuthorizedPeriod of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services, but resumes (or increases his or her level
of) services before benefits actually begin.
35

ARTICLE VII Accounts
7.1
Participant Accounts The Administrator will establish and maintain an Account for each Participant, for each period of employment. Solely for
this purpose, a period of employment will be treated as commencing upon a Participant’s eligibility for the Plan (following
hire or rehire as applicable) and ending with his or her Separation from Service.
Each Account will be credited with Participant Deferrals and Company Contributions for the relevant period of employment,
as well as Earnings Credits described in Section 7.2 below. Each Account will be reduced as payments are made.
In connection with the January 1, 2019 amendment and restatement of the Plan, there was a one-time transfer of certain
Restoration Benefit sub-accounts of certain participants from the Plan to The Boeing Company Supplemental Savings Plan
(the “SSP”) such that the opening account balances of such participants in the SSP on January 1, 2019 was equal to the
closing balance of such participants’ Restoration Accounts in the Plan on December 31, 2018. The affected participants were:
(A) each Employee (as defined in the SSP) who was an Eligible Employee (as defined in the SSP) on January 1, 2019, and
was a participant in the Restoration Benefit of the Plan prior to 2019 and (B) each other current or former Employee (as
defined in the SSP) who was not as of January 1, 2019 and had never been on the E-Series Payroll (as such term is defined in
the Plan).
7.2
Earnings Credits A Participant’s Account(s) will be credited, at the Participant’s (or, if applicable, Beneficiary’s) election, with earnings under
one or more of the following, as the individual elects and subject to any rules or limitations as may be imposed by the
Administrator: (i) the Interest Fund method, (ii) the Boeing Stock Fund method, or (iii) the Other Investment Funds method,
each as described below. In the absence of an election the Interest Fund method will be used.
(A)
Interest Fund Method Under this method, a Participant’s Interest Fund method sub-account shall be adjusted daily in accordance with
changes in the unit value of the sub-account to reflect interest, based on the Participant’s sub-account balance.
Interest will be calculated for each Plan Year as the mean between the high and low (during the first eleven months of
the preceding Plan Year) of yields on AA-rated industrial bonds as reported by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.,
rounded to the nearest ¼th of one percent. Participants will be notified annually of the established interest rate.
(B)
Boeing Stock Fund Method Under this method, a Participant’s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account shall be credited with the number of shares of the
common stock of The Boeing Company that could be purchased with the amount credited to such sub-account, based
on the Fair Market Value of the common stock of The Boeing Company on the day the sub-account is so credited (or
on the next business day on which the New York Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) is open, if the Exchange is closed
on the
36

day the sub-account is credited) excluding commissions, taxes, and other charges. Such number shall be recorded asstock units in the Participant’s sub-account, for bookkeeping purposes only. For purposes of the Plan, “Fair Market
Value” means the closing price for the common stock of The Boeing Company as reported for the “New York Stock
Exchange - Composite Transactions” for a single trading day. The number of stock units in a sub-account shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and other like adjustments in the common stock of The
Boeing Company.
Each Participant’s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account periodically shall be credited with the number of shares of the
common stock of The Boeing Company that could be purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, with an
amount equal to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number of shares of the common stock of The
Boeing Company that equals the number of stock units in a Participant’s sub-account. The timing and methodology
will mirror the Boeing 401(k) dividend process. Participants will be notified annually of the number of stock units,
and the dividend equivalents, credited to their sub-account.
(C)
Other Investment Funds Method Under this method, a Participant may choose to diversify his or her Other Investment Funds sub-account by electing
that it be credited (or charged) with the expenses, income, gains and losses on investment funds similar to those
offered under the Boeing 401(k) (excluding the Boeing Stock Fund and Stable Value Fund offered thereunder) as
designated by the Administrator from time to time, pursuant to an election by the Participant to have the Participant’s
sub-account credited as though the Participant had elected to invest in such funds in such increments as the
Participant will direct in accordance with rules established by the Administrator or its delegates; provided that the
Administrator may disregard such elections in its discretion.
Earnings credits to a Participant’s Account(s) may be subject to valuation adjustments in accordance with the procedures
established by the Administrator; provided, in no event will the portion of a Participant’s Account(s) that has been distributed
as of the time a valuation adjustment is made be subject to such valuation adjustment.
37

7.3Investment Election Changes and Restrictions A Participant may change how future additions to his or her Account(s) are deemed invested anytime during the Plan Year
subject to the Administrator’s rules and restrictions. The Participant may also transfer any portion of his or her sub-accounts
from one investment fund to another on a daily basis, provided that a Participant may not transfer funds from one investment
fund to another and back on the same day.
In addition, transfers cannot be made into the Boeing Stock Fund for 30 calendar days after transferring funds out of the
Boeing Stock Fund. This restriction applies regardless of the number of units or the dollar value of the transfer. However, the
Participant may continue to direct future additions into the Boeing Stock Fund and make transfers out of this investment fund
at any time, subject to insider trading rules.
7.4
Missing Participants and Improper Credits A Participant’s Account may be forfeited or reduced upon the occurrence of one of the following events, even if 100%
vested:
(A)
The Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to distribute amounts from his or her Account (a “missing participant”).
(B)
The Administrator recaptures amounts improperly credited to a Participant’s Account. See also Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment and Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan.

ARTICLE VIII Administration
8.1
Plan Administration The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator shall make such rules, interpretations,
determinations of fact and computations as it may deem appropriate, including (without limitation) requiring the use of an
electronic or telephonic system for purposes of Participant elections and designations. Any decision of the Administrator
with respect to the Plan, including (without limitation) any determination of eligibility to participate in the Plan and any
calculation of Plan benefits, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. The Administrator shall submit to the
Compensation Committee periodic reports covering the operation of the Plan.
8.2
Claims Procedure The procedures for making claims for benefits under the Plan and for having the denial of a benefits claim reviewed shall be
the same as those procedures set forth in the Boeing 401(k), provided that the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors shall be substituted for the Administrator thereunder for purposes of the review of claims and appeals with respect
to benefits under the Plan for elected officers of the Company (other than determinations related to potential forfeiture or
reimbursement of benefits under Sections 5.5 or 5.7 of the Plan, which such determinations shall be made by the
Administrator).
See Section 10.8 regarding limitations on subsequent legal action.
39

ARTICLE IX Amendment and Termination
The Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee, the Administrator, and their respective delegate or delegates shall each have
the authority to amend the Plan at any time, including, but not limited to, the authority to adopt amendments to combine or transfer
all or part of the Plan with or to other plans maintained by the Controlled Group (including a termination of the Plan for that
purpose) or to change the timing of eligibility for participation in the Plan; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee
shall have the exclusive authority to adopt any amendments or make any other changes to the Plan that change the rate or amount of
Company-provided benefits for employees on the E-Series Payroll. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to terminate the
Plan at any time.
In the event of Plan amendment or termination, a Participant’s benefits under the Plan shall not be less than the Plan benefits to
which the Participant would be entitled if the Participant had terminated employment immediately prior to such amendment or
termination of the Plan, increased or decreased by any Earnings Credits attributable to periods on or after the effective date of such
amendment or termination.
In general, upon the termination of the Plan with respect to any Participant, the affected Participants will not be entitled to receive a
distribution until the time specified in Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Boeing Company may, in its discretion,
terminate the entire Plan and pay each Participant a single lump-sum distribution of his or her entire accrued benefit to the extent
permitted under conditions set forth in Code section 409A and any IRS or Treasury guidance thereunder.
40

ARTICLE X Miscellaneous
10.1
No Employment Rights Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any person any right to remain in the employ of the Company or other member
of the Controlled Group, as applicable, or affect any right of the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as
applicable, to terminate a person’s employment with or without cause.
10.2
Anti-Assignment No benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal process. Any attempt to take such action shall
be void and shall authorize the Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, to forfeit all further right and interest in any
benefit under this Plan. In addition, a Participant’s Account may be reduced by the amount of any tax obligation paid by the
Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, on behalf of a Participant, Beneficiary, or any other
person, if such individual fails to reimburse the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, for such
obligation.
10.3
Unfunded Status of Plan No funds shall be segregated or earmarked for or in the Account of any current or former Participant, Beneficiary or other
person under the Plan. However, the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, may establish one or
more trusts to assist in meeting its obligations under the Plan, the assets of which shall be subject to the claim
s of the generalcreditors of the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable. No current or former Participant,
Beneficiary or other person, individually or as a member of a group, shall have any right, title or interest in any account,
fund, grantor trust, or any asset that may be acquired by the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as
applicable, in respect of its obligations under the Plan (other than as a general creditor of the Company or other member of
the Controlled Group, as applicable, with an unsecured claim against its general assets).
10.4
Delays or Acceleration in Payment Payment of benefits under this Plan may be delayed or accelerated to the extent permitted by Code section 409A, as
determined by the Administrator.
10.5
Involuntary Inclusion in Income If a determination is made that the Account of any Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is subject to current income taxation
under Code section 409A, then the taxable portion of such Account will be immediately distributed to the Participant (or his
or her Beneficiary), notwithstanding the general timing rules otherwise described herein.
41

10.6Compliance with Code Section 409A It is intended that amounts deferred under this Plan will not be taxable under Code section 409A with respect to any
individual. All provisions of this Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with this intent.
10.7
Construction The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions will be determined under and will be construed according to federal law and,
to the extent permissible, according to the internal laws of the state of Illinois. If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or
invalid for any reason, such determination will not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan and the Plan will be construed
and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included.
10.8
Legal Action No legal action may be brought in court on a claim for benefits under the Plan after 180 days following the decision on
appeal (or 180 days following the expiration of the time to make an appeal decision if no appeal is made). The Plan, all
benefits awarded thereunder, and all determinations and other actions with respect thereto, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Illinois without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, except to the extent preempted by the laws of the
United States.  Participants irrevocably consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts
located in the State of Illinois, Cook County.
10.9
Tax Withholding The Company, or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, has the right to deduct any federal, state, local or
foreign taxes that are required to be withheld from any payments made hereunder. In addition, if prior to the date of payment
of any amount hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code Sections 3101, 3121(a)
and 3121(v)(2), where applicable, becomes due, then the Company, or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable,
shall have the right to deduct such tax from any other payments made to the Participant or direct that the Participant’s
Account be reduced by the amount needed to pay the Participant’s portion of such tax, plus an amount equal to the
withholding taxes due under federal, state or local law resulting from the payment of such FICA tax, and an additional
amount to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding of the Code section 3401 wages
and taxes, but no greater than the aggregate of the FICA tax amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax
amount. Each Participant shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any benefits under the
Plan that exceed the amounts withheld.
10.10
Liability for Benefit Payments The obligation to pay or provide for payment of a benefit hereunder to any Participant or Beneficiary shall be the sole and
exclusive liability and responsibility of the employer which employed the Participant during the period which contributions
were made, unless another entity has specifically assumed such liability. No other affiliate or subsidiary of such employer
shall be liable or responsible for such payment, and nothing in the Plan shall be construed as creating or imposing any joint
or shared liability for any such payment. The fact that a company other than the employer actually makes one or more
payments to a Participant or Beneficiary shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision;
42

rather, any such payment shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of and for the account of the employer.10.11
Recovery of Plan Overpayments The Plan shall have the right to offset from any future benefit payments due hereunder to (or with respect to) such individual
the amount of such excess in such manner as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion or, if such offset i
s notpossible, the Administrator may undertake such actions as it deems reasonable to recover the excess.
10.12
Notice Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or
sent by registered or certified mail, to (a) The Boeing Company’s headquarters, with attention to the Secretary of the
Company, if the notice or filing is to be made to the Administrator or the Company or (b) the Participant’s or Beneficiary’s
address on file with the Company, if the notice or filing is to be made to such individual. Such notice shall be deemed given
as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration
or certification.

control.
No DCP Deferrals were made to the DCP with respect to Base Pay earned and paid on and after January 1, 2019, Annual Incentive
Awards with performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, or Performance Awards with grant dates on or after

prior to January 1, 2006) the Company no longer provided any DCP Matching Contributions on any DCP Deferrals into a Boeing
Stock Fund account; provided that in the case of DCP Deferrals that were the subject of a deferral election into a Boeing Stock Fund
account made prior to January 1, 2005, the Company continued to match such DCP Deferrals of Boeing Stock Units and
Performance Share Awards that are not yet vested (upon vesting) and such DCP Deferrals of 2005 Annual Incentive Awards that
were paid in 2006. To the extent that the Company previously a DCP Matching Contribution with respect to all or part of any
amounts previously deferred under the DCP, each such DCP Matching Contribution was deferred together with the Deferral to
which it relates, and is subject to all of the Participant elections (including default elections) with respect to such Deferral.

Forfeiture and Reinstatement of Matching Contributions (A)
Any DCP Matching Contribution shall be canceled and forfeited if the Participant Separates from Service for any reason other than retirement under a retirement plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the
Company, layoff, or death. The forfeited DCP Matching Contribution (and any Earnings Credits that would have
accrued but for the forfeiture) will be reinstated upon rehire, only where (i) the Participant’s Separation from Service
occurred while the Participant was on an Authorized Period of Absence or due to a reasonably anticipated permanent
reduction in the level of services performed by the Participant to less than 50 percent of the average level of services
performed by the Participant during the immediately preceding 36-month period, and (ii) the Participant’s Separation
from Service was deemed a Separation from Service under Code section 409A or the terms of this Plan (i.e., the
Participant did not incur a termination of employment with the Controlled Group).
(B)

a reduced level of services due to retirement under a plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the
Company, layoff or death, or (iii) the Participant’s return to active employment at a level of services that is 50 percent
or more of the average level of services performed by the Participant prior to his or her prior deemed Separation from
Service due to a reduction in services. Such reinstated benefits will remain subject to the forfeiture provisions of the
first sentence of section 1(A) the payment timing rules under Section 3(A) hereof.

the terms of the Plan. If a Participant has both a DCP Account and another Account under the Plan, then the
Participant’s beneficiary designation under the DCP will become null and void as of January 1, 2022, and such
Participant who wishes to designate a Beneficiary must make a new beneficiary designation in accordance with the

 and/or settlements of other outstanding Awards as it determines to be fair and equitable to affected Participants. Upon receipt by anyaffected Participant of any such
 Substitute Award (or payment) as a result of any such Corporate Transaction, such Participant’s affected Awards forwhich
 such Substitute Awards (or payment) were received shall be thereupon cancelled without the need for obtaining the consent of any suchaffected Participant.
Subject
 to  the  provisions  of  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Board  shall  not  take  any  further  action  that  causes  any  Awards,  which  are  not  thenexercisable and vested, to automatically become veste
d and exercisable in connection with a Corporate Transaction under this Section 14.3.For purposes of the Plan,
(a)
 “Corporate Transaction” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)of
 the  Exchange  Act)  becomes  the  “beneficial  owner”  (as  defined  in  Rule  13d-3  of  the  Exchange  Act),  directly  or  indirectly,  of  securities  of  theCompany representing fifty percent (50%)
 or more of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then-outstanding voting securities; (ii) theconsummation
 of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; (iii) the consummation of a merger orconsolidation
 of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of theCompany outstanding immediately prior
 thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securitiesof
 the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or suchsurviving
 entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (iv) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute theBoard (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a
 majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming adirector
 subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of atleast
 a  majority  of  the  directors  then  comprising  the  Incumbent  Board  shall  be  considered  as  though  such  individual  were  a  member  of  theIncumbent Board,
 but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatenedelection contest with
 respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf ofa person other than the Board.
(b)
 “Corporate Transaction Price” means the highest price per share of Common Stock paid in any transaction related to a Corporate Transaction.To
 the extent that the consideration paid in any Corporate Transaction consists all or in part of securities or other non-cash consideration, the valueof
 such securities or other non-cash consideration shall be determined in the good-faith discretion of the Board consistent with provisions of Section409A and/or other
 applicable law.Section 15. Amendment and Termination
15.1 
Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan. The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advis
able; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law,regulation or stock exchange rule, sharehol
der approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, an amendment that constitutes a “material revision,” as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange shallbe submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval. In
9

addition,  any  revision  that  deletes  or  limits  the  scope  of  the  provisions  in  Sections  7.2  and  8.4  prohibiting  repricing  of  Options  or  SARs  withoutshareholder
 approval and any revision that increases the number of shares stated in Section 4.1 as available for issuance under the Plan shall beconsidered material revisions that require shareh
older approval.15.2 
Term  of the Plan. Unless  sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Shareholder Approval EffectiveDate.
 After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance withtheir
 applicable  terms  and  conditions  and  the  Plan’s  terms  and  conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  Incentive  Stock  Options  may  begranted more than ten years after the adoption in February 2014 of this amende
d and restated Plan by the Board.15.3
 Consent of Participant. The  amendment,  suspension or termination  of the Plan or a portion thereof  or the amendment  of an outstandingAward
 shall  not,  without  the  Participant’s  consent,  materially  adversely  affect  any  rights  under  any  Award  theretofore  granted  to  the  Participantunder
 the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in amanner
 so as to constitute a “modification” that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ad
justments made pursuant to Section 14 shall not be subject to these restrictions.Section 16. General
16.1 
Clawbacks. Awards  under the Plan shall be subject to the Clawback Policy as adopted by the Board and as amended from time to time. Inaddition,
 subject to applicable local law, or except as otherwise expressly provided pursuant to an applicable Award agreement, Awards grantedunder the
 Plan shall be subject to clawback and forfeiture (meaning that the Award must be promptly returned to the Company if already distributed,or
 that a Participant will lose his or her entitlement to an Award if it has not yet been distributed) in the event a Participant or former Participantengages
 in any of the following conduct, as determined by the Company or its delegate in its sole discretion, prior to the second anniversary of thelater of the vesting or
 receipt of payment of the Award: the Participant (i) pleads or admits to, is convicted of, or is otherwise found guilty of a criminalor indictable offense involving theft, f
raud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company’s interests; (ii)directly
 or  indirectly  engages  in  competition  with  any  aspect  of  Company  business  with  which  the  Participant  was  involved  or  about  which  theParticipant
 gained Company proprietary or confidential information;  (iii) induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company’semployees,
 representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with theCompany,
 in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Participant or any third party; (iv) disparages or defames the Company,itsproducts,

 unlawful  conduct  in  the  workplace;  or  (v)  takes,  misappropriates,  uses,  or  discloses  Company  proprietary  or  confidential  information.Clawback
 can, if applicable and where permitted by applicable local law, be made by deducting payments that will be due in the future (includingsalary,
 bonuses,  and  other  forms  of  compensation).  A  Participant’s  acceptance  of  an  Award  under  the  Plan  shall  constitute  such  Participant’sacknowledgement
 and recognition that the Participant’s compliance with this Section is a condition for the Participant’s receipt of the Award. Forpurposes of this Section, the Company shall incl
ude the Company and all Related Companies.Nothing
 in this Section 16.1 will apply to legally protected  communications  to government  agencies or statements  made in the course  of sworntestimony in administrative, judicial or arbitral proceed
ings.16.2 
No  Individual Rights. No  individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has noobligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
Furthermore,
 nothing  in  the  Plan  or  any  Award  granted  under  the  Plan  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  an  employment  contract  or  confer  or  bedeemed
 to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any RelatedCompany or
 limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant’s employment or other relationship at anytime, with or without cause.
16.3 
Issuance  of Shares. Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares ofCommon
 Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, suchissuance,
 delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or thelaws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applic
able requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.10

The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, orto
 register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issuedunder,
 or created  by,  the Plan,  or  to continue  in effect  any such registrations  or  qualifications  if  made.  The Company  may  issue certificates  forshares with such legends and subject to
 such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary ordesirable
 for  compliance  by  the  Company  with  federal,  state  and  foreign  securities  laws.  The  Company  may  also  require  such  other  action  oragreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities l
aws.To
 the  extent  the  Plan  or  any  instrument  evidencing  an  Award  provides  for  issuance  of  stock  certificates  to  reflect  the  issuance  of  shares  ofCommon Stock, the issuance may
 be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of anystock exchange.
16.4 
Indemnification. Each  person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of theCompany to
 whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 3 shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and fromany
 loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim,action,
 suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to actunder
 the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company’s approval, or paid by him orher
 in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give theCompany an opportunity, at its
 own expense, to handle and defend such claim, action, suit or proceeding before he or she undertakes to handle anddefend
 the same on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except asexpressly provided by statute.
The
 foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under theCompany’
s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them orhold them harmless.
16.5 
No  Rights  as  a  Shareholder. Unless  otherwise  provided  by  the  Committee  or  in  the  instrument  evidencing  the  Award  or  in  a  writtenemployment
 or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other rightof a shareholder unless and until the date of issu
ance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award.16.6
 Compliance With Laws and Regulations. Notwithstanding  anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, maybifurcate
 the Plan so as to restrict,  limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject toSection 16
 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants. With respect to officers anddirectors
 subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Additionally,
 in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, tothe extent permitted by law, be construed as an “incentive stock option” within the mea
ning of Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision.Additionally,
 notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, it is the Company’s intention that any and all Awards and compensationpayable
 under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A and that all terms and provisions shall be interpreted tosatisfy
 such requirements. If the Committee determines that an Award, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or any other action orarrangement
 contemplated  by  the  provisions  of  the  Plan  would,  if  undertaken,  cause  a  Participant  to  become  subject  to  Section  409A,  theCommittee, to the
 extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right , but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend ormodify the
 Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A. Awards notdeferred
 under  Section  6.3  and not  otherwise  exempt  from  the  requirements  of  Section  409A are  intended  to  qualify  for  the  short-term  deferralexemption
 to Section 409A, and payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Award became vested, but in no event shallsuch
 payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Award became vested unless otherwise permittedunder
 the exemption provisions of Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Award made under the Plan that is determinedto be
 “deferred compensation” (within the meaning of Section 409A), (a) references to Termination of Service will mean the Participant’s “separationfrom
 service” (within the meaning of Section 409A) with the Company or any applicable Related Company, and (b) any payment to be made withrespect
 to such Award in connection with the Participant’s Termination of Service that would be subject to the limitations in Section 409A(a)(2)(b) ofthe Code shall be delayed u
ntil six months after11

the Participant’s separation from service (or earlier death) in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.16.7 
Participants  in Other Countries. The  Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may benecessary
 or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate toensure
 the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and tomeet the objectives of the Plan.
Notwithsta
nding the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 8.1, where applicable foreign law requires that compensatory stock right be priced based upon aspecific
 price averaging method and period, a stock right granted in accordance with such applicable foreign law will be treated as meeting therequirements of Sections 7.2 or 8.1, provided that the averaging perio
d does not exceed 30 days.16.8 
No  Trust or Fund. The  Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregateany
 monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferredamounts
 payable to any Participant,  and no Participant  shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor  of theCompany.
16.9 
Successors All obligations of the Company under the  Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whetherthe
 existence  of  such  successor  is  the  result  of  a  direct  or  indirect  purchase,  merger,  consolidation,  or  otherwise,  of  all  or  substantially  all  thebusiness and/or assets of the Company.
16.10
 Severability. If  any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to anyperson, or would disqualify the Plan or any A
ward under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemedamended
 to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee’s determination, materiallyaltering
 the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Planand any such Award shall remain in full force an
d effect.16.11 
Choice  of Law. The  Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent nototherwise
 governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,without reference to the principles of conflict of laws thereof, except as otherwise express
ly provided in an applicable Award agreement.Section 17. Restatement Effective Date
This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall be effective Decemb
