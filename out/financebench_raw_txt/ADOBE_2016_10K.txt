customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We offer many 
of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted 
or cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain products and 
services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software 
vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our 
technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our 
products run on personal and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the 
product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). See Note

BUSINESS OVER VIEW
 
For over 30 years, Adobe’ s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments interact. 
Across these markets, we help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow , and 
optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital 
experiences, across media and devices, anywhere, anytime.
While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services, and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic 
growth areas:
Digital Media—providing tools, services and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises 
to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers 
and digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our 
customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have 
delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model rapidly to provide these customers with a more complete 
and integrated workflow across the variety of new devices, formats and business models that continue to emer ge.
Digital Marketing—providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital 
advertising and marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, 
Table of Contents
4merchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and 
sales and support executives. We process over 90 trillion data transactions a year via our SaaS products, providing our customers 
with analytics, social, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, 
audience management and video solutions. This complements our digital media franchise, bringing together the art of creating 
and managing content with the science of measuring and optimizing it, enabling our customers to achieve their optimal business 
outcomes.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories, where 
our mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobe’ s 
business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. 
In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, 
management, delivery , measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue 
investing in engaging their constituents digitally .
SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. These 
segments provide Adobe’ s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are 
aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Print and Publishing business in a third segment 
that contains some of our mature products and solutions.
This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2017 and beyond 
for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”  and Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment 
information.
PRODUCTS AND SER VICES OVER VIEW
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
Recent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in 
digital media. Due to increases in mobile computing and bandwidth, rich media consumed in digital environments and the rise of 
online social communities, the demand for digital media solutions to create engaging online experiences is higher than ever. Adobe 
is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering rapid innovation to increase our customer reach, deepen 
engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed 
on a subscription basis.
The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud—a subscription service that allows members to use 
Adobe’ s creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktops, web and mobile devices.  Creative Cloud 
members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator , Adobe 
Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe InDesign and many more creative applications.  They can also use Creative 
Cloud mobile apps and integrated cloud-delivered services on their connected devices such as smartphones and mobile devices 
to augment their creative process wherever they go.  In addition, members can access a growing marketplace of digital content 
through Adobe Stock, a leading online marketplace for photos, graphics and videos, as well as fonts from the Adobe Typekit 
marketplace. Through Creative Cloud, members can access online services to sync, store, and share files; showcase and discover 
work on Behance, the largest online community of creative professionals; publish and deliver digital content via app stores; develop 
mobile apps; and design and manage websites. Adobe is redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers 
can obtain everything they need to create, collaborate and deliver engaging digital content. A core part of Creative Cloud is Adobe 
Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. 
Adobe Sensei leverages machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning capabilities to tackle today’ s complex 
creative experience challenges. 
Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals including graphic designers, production artists, web designers 
and developers, experience and user interface designers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game 
developers, mobile application developers, students and administrators. They rely on our solutions for publishing, web design and 
development, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and document creation and collaboration. 
End users of our creative tools work in businesses ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to 
smaller design agencies, small and medium-sized businesses and individual freelancers. Moreover , our creative solutions are used 
Table of Contents
5to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with every day, including video, animation, 
mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers also use our solutions to create and 
deliver creative content.
Our Digital Media business offers many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including cloud-
enabled subscriptions to the Creative Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and 
services, including our hobbyist products such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements, Adobe Typekit and 
mobile apps such as Adobe Photoshop Mix, Adobe Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Photoshop Fix, Adobe Capture CC, and Adobe Spark 
that run on tablets and mobile devices. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal 
Products and Services.”
Adobe’ s Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of solutions, 
the Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services. For over twenty years, Adobe Acrobat has 
provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users 
can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF 
documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Adobe Acrobat Reader . Acrobat provides essential electronic 
document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide range of tasks ranging from simple publications 
and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative 
cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solutions. Users can take advantage of electronic document signing with 
Adobe Sign and manage, track and control documents through Adobe Send & Track.
Digital Media Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of tools and services that allow individuals, small and medium businesses and 
enterprises to create, publish and monetize their content anywhere.
We expect to continue driving new user adoption of our creative business over the next several years outside of our core 
creative professional target market because of the attractive monthly subscription pricing for Creative Cloud combined with the 
strong brand of our creative solutions and the broad value proposition provided by Creative Cloud. The subscription model results 
in a ratably reported revenue stream that is recurring and highly predictable. 
We are focused on migrating existing users from older versions to current versions of our offerings, and new customer 
adoption. Aspects of this strategy include: focusing future innovation by our engineering teams on delivering cloud-based 
functionality , such as Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe CreativeSync, to enable our customers to use our creative tools and 
services across a variety of devices in ways that are not possible with previous desktop versions; integrating Creative Cloud with 
our Adobe Stock online marketplace offerings; increasing the value of Creative Cloud by delivering frequent updates and 
enhancements to subscribers to address their content creation challenges; using promotions to attract customers to the offering; 
expanding our go-to-market reach through channel partners to acquire new customers; and utilizing Creative Cloud for teams and 
Creative Cloud for enterprise offerings to drive broad adoption with customers who license our offerings in volume.
As part of our Creative Cloud strategy , we utilize our digital marketing solutions to drive customer awareness of our creative 
products and increase sales of our products through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming 
the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. 
We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force 
is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
In our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries 
such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are 
tens of millions of users who still need the capabilities provided by Acrobat. We plan to continue to market the benefits of our 
Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as well as small and 
medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world and increase our seat penetration in these 
markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing 
and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as 
well as on expanding into emer ging markets, while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document 
services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader users. We intend to continue promoting the capabilities of our cloud-based 
document solutions to millions of Acrobat users and hundreds of millions of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe Sign services 
provide a green alternative to costly paper -based solutions, and are an easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. 
We believe that by growing the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing 
to add new capabilities to our Adobe Sign offering, we can help our customers migrate away from paper -based express mailing 
and adopt our solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.

6Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing Opportunity
Consumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their online interactions, across multiple 
channels and devices. As a result, any business or entity with an online presence must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire 
and retain customers in a world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impacts success. Delivering the best experience 
to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Marketing executives are increasingly 
demanding solutions that optimize their consumers’  experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing spend so they 
can demonstrate the success of their programs using objective metrics.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. 
Chief Marketing Officers, digital marketers, advertisers and publishers are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and 
development budgets toward digital media. Many industry analysts predict more advertising dollars will be spent in digital than 
in traditional media in the future. As marketers make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for 
vendors to help them navigate this transition. However , marketing in a digital world is not simply about executing campaigns in 
each digital channel. Marketers, and entire enterprises, also need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers 
across both digital and traditional channels and in areas such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect 
experiences to be consistent and personalized.
Our Digital Marketing business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions for data 
and analytics, advertising, personalization, and content delivery .  Our solutions focused on these categories include features for 
web and mobile analytics, social marketing, targeting, advertising and media optimization, digital experience management, cross-
channel campaign management, audience management, advertising and real-time bidding technology , premium video delivery 
and monetization. We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers 
to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal business 
performance. With its broad set of solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer , 
Adobe Experience Manager , Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime, as well as real-time dashboards 
and a collaborative interface, customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver 
a personalized brand experience to their consumers. The artificial intelligence and machine learning framework enabled by our 
strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances Adobe Marketing Cloud.  By building on existing features such as anomaly detection in 
Adobe Analytics and predictive outcome capabilities with solutions such as Adobe Campaign, we believe Sensei will increase the 
value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.
In addition to Chief Marketing Officers and digital experience professionals, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions 
include marketing professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers, marketing research analysts and 
customer analytics teams. Customers also include web content editors, web analysts, web marketing managers, email developers 
and mobile apps developers. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital 
Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business 
with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, 
measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
Our Digital Marketing segment also contains two legacy enterprise software offerings: our Adobe Connect web conferencing 
platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing and licensing 
these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales force. We have 
also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities based on our 
Adobe Experience Manager solution.
Digital Marketing Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of marketing solutions and a standard for the way digital advertising and marketing 
is created, measured, managed, executed and optimized.
We believe that our success will be driven by focusing our efforts on making Adobe Marketing Cloud the most comprehensive 
and integrated marketing solution available. We focus on four key market opportunities: Personalization, Content, Advertising, 
and Data & Analytics.  Our focus on these opportunities utilizes nine key solutions—Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, 
Adobe Media Optimizer , Adobe Experience Manager , Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager , Adobe Primetime and the 
TubeMogul advertising platform. 
Table of Contents
7These solutions provide marketers with key capabilities, such as the ability to:
• Combine data across the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions and third-party data sources, such as customer relationship 
management, point of sale, e-commerce, advertising, outlets, support systems, and surveys, to create a single view of 
the consumer;
• Deliver consistent personalized customer experiences across channels and on any device;
• Use predictive analytics to enable marketers to utilize past marketing program data and success to predict and drive 
their future success with digital marketing programs;
• Access all Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions from one centralized platform and visualize, socialize, and collaborate 
across teams with the interface;
• Interact with creatives through integration with Creative Cloud, enabling content creators and marketers to collaborate 
and communicate in real time within a cloud-based platform;
• Accurately forecast and continually optimize their mix of campaigns across digital media;
• Provide robust cross-channel campaign orchestration capabilities utilizing real-time insights, rich customer data and a 
sophisticated automation and execution platform;
• Manage, publish, track, and monetize social programs;
• Store, assemble, and distribute digital assets to deliver high-quality brand, campaign, and content experiences;
• Build unique audience profiles, allowing marketers to identify their most valuable segments and use them across digital 
channels;
• Easily add, alter, and deploy marketing tags on websites, resulting in consistent page performance and accurate data 
collection; and
• Integrate with a robust network of partners, covering the expansive digital marketing ecosystem.
To drive growth of Adobe Marketing Cloud, we also intend to streamline how customers learn about, acquire and deploy 
Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. We believe we can accelerate the growth of our business by continuing to build out more direct 
sales capacity , as well as continuing to enable a rich ecosystem of agencies and SIs who sell, implement and service our solutions. 
We believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Marketing segment in fiscal 2017 and 
beyond.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including 
eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals 
and professional publishers continue to require quality , reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript 
and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. 
As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be 
a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry .
We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output 
devices. In fiscal 2016, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and 
license in our Print and Publishing business.

Digital Media Offerings
Creative Cloud
Adobe Creative Cloud is a subscription offering that enables the creation of rich and engaging digital content by a wide 
array of creative professionals, hobbyists and knowledge workers. Through Creative Cloud, users can easily explore, create, publish 
and share their work across devices, the desktop and the web. Members have access to a vibrant creative community , publishing 
services to deliver apps and websites, cloud storage to easily access their work, the ability to sync their files to virtually any device, 
collaboration capabilities with team members, and new products and exclusive updates as they are developed.
Creative Cloud members can build a Creative Profile which persists wherever they are. A user’s Creative Profile moves 
with them via Creative Cloud services from app-to-app and device-to-device, giving them immediate access to their personal files, 
photos, graphics, colors, fonts, text styles, desktop setting customizations and other important assets. Furthermore, Adobe  
CreativeSync, powered by Adobe Sensei, synchronizes all files, photos, fonts and other assets used in a particular workflow so 
that users can begin creative work on any device and seamlessly continue it on another .
New Creative Cloud services have been developed and delivered to subscribers to increase the utilization of Creative Cloud 
capabilities beyond the use of our desktop tools. One of these new services, Adobe Stock, is an online marketplace with over 60 
million curated photos, graphics, videos, templates and 3D assets that is deeply integrated with Creative Cloud apps. We believe 
services such as Adobe Stock will drive higher user interaction with Creative Cloud and create upsell opportunities as users 
increasingly utilize higher -tiered versions of these services.
New mobile apps that run on tablets and smartphones enable connections between Creative Cloud desktop tools and a new 
family of mobile apps that extend the capabilities of Photoshop, Illustrator , Premiere Pro and Lightroom onto mobile devices.  Our 
mobile apps enable users to create designs with tablets as an integrated part of their creative workflows.
We license Creative Cloud to individuals and teams of users through Adobe.com either on a monthly subscription basis or 
as an annual subscription. Channel partners also license Creative Cloud with annual team subscriptions to small or medium-sized 
businesses, or to workgroups in enterprises. With larger enterprise customers, our direct sales force utilizes enterprise term license

of Photoshop through an easy-to-use interface. For tablet and smartphone users, we offer several mobile apps including Photoshop 
Sketch, Photoshop Mix, Lightroom for mobile and Photoshop Fix—all of which enable sophisticated photo editing and content

product used for professional writing and editing to enable an efficient collaborative workflow between design and editorial staff. 
InDesign and InCopy are available to Creative Cloud subscribers, and customers can also subscribe to use InDesign as an individual 
cloud-enabled subscription product.
Adobe Premier e Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro is our powerful, customizable, nonlinear video editing tool used by video professionals. Customers 
can import and combine virtually any type of media, from video shot on a smartphone to raw 4K and higher resolution footage, 
and then edit in its native format without transcoding. The user interface includes a customizable timeline and numerous editing 
shortcuts which enable faster , keyboard-driven editing.
With the demands of shorter production schedules and high-resolution digital media formats, real-time performance is

We also of fer a broad range of other enterprise and digital media products and solutions. Information about other 
products not referenced here can be found on our corporate website, www .adobe.com, under the “Products” tab available in the 
“Menu.”
COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent new product introductions, 
short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new 
products on a timely and cost-ef fective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build 
customer confidence and combat cyber -attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate and respond to 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.
Digital Media
No single company has offerings identical to our Creative Cloud products and services, but we face collective competition 
from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competitors include offerings from companies such 
as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Quark, Getty Images, Shutterstock and others, as well as from many lower -end 
offerings available on touch-enabled devices via app stores, and from various open source initiatives. We believe our greatest 
advantage in this space is the scope of our integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative 
Cloud we also compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality , ease of use, product reliability , value and performance 
characteristics.
Table of Contents
13Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand 
awareness and price sensitivity . Competition in this space is also emer ging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet 
and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly 
evolving and highly volatile. In this area we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various 
proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.
The needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware 
advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other new devices. 
Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition from 
established and emer ging companies offering similar products.
New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are 
also emer ging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense 
competition, including customer price sensitivity , competitor brand awareness and competitor strength in OEM bundling and retail 
distribution. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies that 
market software that competes with ours.
The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily 
operates today with the Adobe Stock offering and Fotolia.com. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images 
and a number of smaller companies.  Adobe Stock’ s deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and 
relationships with creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.
In addition, we face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings 
by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software, or those of our competitors. Similarly , we face potential competition 
from operating system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features 
with their operating systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video 
software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social 
networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as 
Google, Bing and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing 
and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers in particular will be 
encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
Competition is also emer ging with imaging and video applications on smartphone and tablet platforms. Competitors are 
extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apple’ s iPhone and iPad, and other smartphone and tablet devices. 
Similarly , new cloud-based offerings continue to emer ge which offer image editing and video-editing capabilities, as well as social 
and sharing features.
The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge 
workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and 
Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other 
PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web. To address these competitive threats, we are working to 
ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emer ging opportunities such as PDF document 
generation, document collaboration and document security .
As e-signatures are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors to Adobe Sign such as DocuSign 
and Citrix have been jumping in to take advantage of the growing space. We face strong competition from these and other companies 
in this space.

14Digital Marketing
The markets in which our Digital Marketing business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense 
competition. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Marketo, Oracle, 
salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Yahoo!, Verizon, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. 
Additionally , new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to 
customers, generally through a web browser , while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. 
In addition, we compete at times with our customers’  or potential customers’  internally developed applications. Of the competitors 
listed above, no single company has products identical to our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud competes 
in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; 
audience management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; video delivery and monetization; web experience 
management and others.
Many of the companies with which we compete offer a variety of products or services and as a result could also bundle 
their products or services, which may result in these companies effectively selling their products or services at or below market 
prices for individual products. In addition, large software, internet and database management companies have expanded their 
offerings in the digital marketing area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic 
partners of ours. We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security , scalability , flexibility 
and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual 
appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-ef fective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing 
business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time 
data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in 
educating customers in how to utilize services effectively . We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-
cost alternatives based on many of these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our 
focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, 
standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital marketing technology 
to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market 
with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital marketing capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete 
technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked 
closely with marketing and creative customers for over thirty years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current 
customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in 
serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, 
digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization 
and social capabilities in our Adobe Marketing Cloud. Most importantly , we provide a vision for our digital marketing customers 
as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud and Document 
Cloud to how they manage, deliver , measure and monetize their content with our Adobe Marketing Cloud.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale electronic and web publishing systems, XML-
based publishing companies as well as lower -end desktop publishing products. Depending on the product line, competition is 
based on a number of factors, including: the quality and features of products, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of 
customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service 
and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among 
users, the widespread adoption of our products among printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming 
interfaces.
In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language 
or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability , price, support and engineering development 
assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency , OEM customer relationships and our 
intellectual property portfolio.

2015 , no single customer was responsible for over 10% of our trade receivables. 
Order  Fulfillment Distribution
Our evolution to a services and subscription-based business model has decreased the need to produce and distribute physical 
products. We still produce packaged products for a small subset of our business, but that percentage is declining as the digital 
delivery of our services and subscriptions continues to grow .
 In regard to physical products that we distribute, the procurement of the various components of packaged products, including 
DVDs and printed materials, and the assembly of packages for retail and other applications are controlled by our product delivery 
operations organization. We outsource our procurement, production, inventory and fulfillment activities to third parties in the 
United States, Germany and Singapore.

in the replication of DVDs, printing and assembly of components.

services teams to share their expertise in leading customers’  digital strategies and multi-solution integrations. Using our 
methodology , our professional services teams are able to accelerate customers’  time to value, and maximize the return customers 
earn on their investment in Adobe solutions.
A key component of Adobe’ s strategy is developing a large partner ecosystem to expand the reach and breadth of Adobe 
solutions in the global marketplace. In order to assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services 
provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe’ s Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the 
program provides system integrators (SIs), digital / media agencies, and regional partners the tools required to develop core 
capabilities for positioning and building with Adobe technology , as well as implementing and running customer platforms. We 
believe that through these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly by the combination of Adobe

17PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT
 
As the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required 
for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new solutions. We develop our software internally as well as 
acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owned the 
technology . In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed 
by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based 
on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.
During fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , our research and development expenses were $976.0 million , $862.7 million  and $844.4 
million , respectively .
PRODUCT  PROTECTION
We regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. 
We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and 
technology . While we believe our patents have significant value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting 
segments. We protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties 
only under limited circumstances and subject to security and confidentiality constraints. From time to time, we secure rights to 
third-party intellectual property if beneficial to our business.
Our products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:
(1) We offer products on a “right to use” basis pursuant to a license agreement that restricts the use of the products to a 
designated number of devices, users or both, and other restrictions. We also rely on copyright laws and on “shrink 
wrap” and electronic licenses that are not physically signed by the end user. Copyright protection may be unavailable 
under the laws of certain countries and the enforceability of “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses has not been 
conclusively determined in all jurisdictions. 
(2) We offer products under a SaaS or on-demand model, where hosted software is provided on demand to customers, 
generally through a web browser . The use of these products is governed by either the online terms of use or an enterprise 
licensing agreement associated with the product.
Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software 
industry . This problem is particularly acute in international markets. We conduct piracy conversion and prevention programs 
directly and through certain external software associations. In addition, we have activation technology in certain products to guard 
against illegal use and will continue to do so in certain future products.

20ITEM 1A.  RISK FACT ORS
As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might 
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below . These and many other factors described 
in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.
If we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services 
that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
The process of developing new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and 
uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’  changing needs and emer ging technological trends, our market share and results of 
operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit 
significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. 
If we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological 
trends, the market’ s acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would suffer. Additionally , any delay 
in the development, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition 
or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our 
competitive position. Furthermore, third parties market certain of our offerings and support certain product functionality . If we 
are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the 
marketplace, to reach new customers and geographies or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could 
suffer.
We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Consumers continue to shift away from personal computers to 
tablet and mobile devices. If we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile devices, our business could be harmed. 
To the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products 
or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those platforms, our business could be harmed. Releases 
of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in 
order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.
Introduction of new products, services and business models by competitors or others could harm our competitive position and 
results of operations.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emer ging 
business and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent 
new product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). Any of 
these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade 
rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and better 
integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-ef fective manner , meet 
changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emer ging standards, business models, 
software delivery methods and other technological developments. If any competing products, services or operating systems that 
are not compatible with our solutions achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. In addition, consolidation 
has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. Further consolidations in these markets may 
subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations. 
The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products 
rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. 
We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, to gauge the performance of their advertisements, and to 
detect and prevent fraudulent activity . Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software 
or applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from 
being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications 
that block cookies could harm our business. 
For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which 
we operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
We may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating 
results. 
The hosted business model we use in our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings typically involves selling services on a 
subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length. Our individual Creative Cloud 
and Document Cloud subscription agreements are generally month-to-month or one year in length, ETLAs for our Digital Media 
Table of Contents
21products and services are generally three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide 
for shorter or longer terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of 
their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew . We cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will 
be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or licenses or for the same duration of time, if at 
all. Moreover , under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the 
expiration of the terms of their agreements. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer 
renewal rates. Our customers’  renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of 
satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add features and functionality , the reliability (including uptime) 
of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, 
the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers’  
spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our 
customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which 
depends on a number of factors, including customers’  satisfaction with our products and services, the level of innovation reflected 
in those additional features, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to 
our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows may decline.
Subscription offerings and ETLAs could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.
Our subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash 
flows. A portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating 
to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may 
not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future 
quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results 
might not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase 
our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers 
will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. 
Additionally , in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could 
affect our revenue, including longer -than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-
element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new 
businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those 
anticipated, estimated or projected.
If we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.
We often release new offerings and employ new product and service delivery methods in connection with our diversification 
into new business models and markets. It is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to 
develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Market acceptance of new product 
and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to (1) include functionality and usability that satisfy customer 
requirements, and (2) optimally price our products and services in light of marketplace conditions, our costs and customer demand. 
New product and service offerings may increase our risk of liability related to the provision of services and cause us to incur 
significant technical, legal or other costs. Market acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including information 
security , reliability , performance, customer preference, social and community engagement, local government regulations regarding 
online services and user-generated content, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in 
certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage customer data and customer content, 
consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services 
to customers in the United States or internationally . If we are unable to respond to these factors, our business could be harmed.
From time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology , 
license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis or release selected technology for industry standardization. Additionally , 
customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. 
To the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance 
of such products or services, our business could be harmed. 
We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where our operating 
history is less extensive. These new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance 
and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, 
larger developer network, deeper market experience and larger sales, consulting and marketing resources. In addition, the metrics 
Table of Contents
22we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve as significant trends emer ge. If we are unable to successfully 
establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer. 
Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of 
the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. 
As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic 
and political conditions, both domestically and globally . Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political 
conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions 
about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology 
purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more 
extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Our customers include government 
entities, including the U.S. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the government’ s ability to purchase our products 
and services, our revenue could decline. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business 
could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial 
condition.
A financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our 
distribution partners and channels. A disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties 
and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely 
harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would 
also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Certain of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions and ETLAs in our Digital 
Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:
• the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of our large-scale deployments of 
our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on 
investment;
• the desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their 
technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures; 
• the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and 
evaluation of our products and services;
• the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers’  business and 
legal representatives;
• the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; 
and
• customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately 
purchase our solutions.  As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could 
have a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally , our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where 
a higher percentage of a quarter ’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter , which is common in our industry .  Our 
extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close. 
Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
Maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security 
researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security 
measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach certain of our data security 
systems and misused certain of our systems and software in order to access our end users’  authentication and payment information. 
In addition, cyber -attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, some of which may 
be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and operating system 
Table of Contents
23applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other 
problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer ’s ability to operate or use our 
products. The costs to prevent, eliminate or alleviate cyber - or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software 
programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful or may be 
delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible 
to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.
Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products 
or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may 
also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. These actual and potential 
breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary 
information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the 
potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could 
expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result 
in litigation and liability or fines, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm 
our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new 
customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand and reputation. 
These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber -attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular 
offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of 
our applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the 
affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and 
services to customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, 
enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, 
deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities 
cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these 
measures quickly enough to prevent cyber -attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our 
preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to 
claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, 
to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the 
appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able 
to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt 
security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. 
Further , if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, it may be necessary 
for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative 
steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. Moreover , delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers 
resulting from disruptions caused by cyber -attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock 
price and reputation.
Some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any 
interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to 
liability and harm our business and reputation.
Some of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, 
other hosted Digital Media offerings and our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, rely on hardware and services hosted and controlled 
directly by us or by our third-party service providers. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical 
applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our 
business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our 
content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted 
offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, thereby 
reducing our revenue.
We hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. A security incident at those 
facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality , integrity or availability of customer data. Unauthorized access to customer 
data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized 
party , employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained 
through inadequate use of security controls by customers. Accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber -attackers to 
gain access to customer data. Additionally , failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of 
accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner , may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. 
If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information 
Table of Contents
24we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject 
to claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach 
of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
Because of the large amount of data that our customers collect and manage using our hosted solutions, it is possible that 
hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or 
corruption, cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant 
or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted 
by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or 
significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems, 
causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. We may also find, 
on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including 
significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. If we supply inaccurate information 
or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could 
be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.
Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and 
results of operations.
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and 
create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may 
even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally , the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may 
require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has issued new accounting standards for revenue 
recognition and leasing and while we know they will have an impact, we are still evaluating the extent that these new accounting 
standards will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Changes resulting from these new standards 
may result in materially different financial results  and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial 
information and that we change financial reporting controls.  For additional information regarding these updated standards, see the 
section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” within Part II. Item 8, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and 
Significant Accounting Policies.”
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our 
business and management.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of a company , division, product or technology , each of which 
involves numerous risks. These risks include:
• difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business;
• difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, 
products or services;
• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
• entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger 
market positions;
• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities 
and challenges;
• inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
• inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
• inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating 
results;
Table of Contents
25• elevated delinquency or bad debt write-of fs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
• increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business 
models;
• additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
• additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us as a 
multinational corporation;
• impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our 
technologies, products or services;
• failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired 
company or technology , including, but not limited to, issues with the acquired company’ s intellectual property , product 
quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber -attacks), privacy practices, 
revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial 
contingencies;
• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an 
acquisition, including, but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other 
third parties;
• incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
• inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
• inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner , approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent 
such acquisitions; 
• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
• delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service 
offerings; and
• incompatibility of business cultures.
Mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky . If we do not complete an announced acquisition 
transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner , we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition 
to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position. 
The success of certain of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers 
of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
The success of certain of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to 
attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain 
existing customers and contributors. To maintain and grow these businesses, we must regularly add new customers and retain 
existing customers. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases 
the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. To attract new customers and contributors and retain existing 
ones, we rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness 
of our marketing efforts. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail 
to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations. 
We may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as 
a result of litigation or other proceedings.
In connection with the enforcement of our intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property 
rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, 
we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual 
property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and 
energies of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every future lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property 
disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into 
royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of 
Table of Contents
26our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the 
markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual 
provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring 
the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with 
our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including 
our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of assets in this portfolio could 
result in lost revenues and thereby ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual 
property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we 
nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, 
they may further harm our business.
If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber -attack or otherwise, we could lose future 
trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete 
with our products by copying functionality , which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and 
operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure 
agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However , there is a risk that our confidential information and 
trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult 
or costly .
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our business models and 
expose us to increased liability .
Our industry is highly regulated, including for privacy and data security . We are also expanding our business in countries 
that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States, and such laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions 
and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly 
scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws and industry self-regulatory 
codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to 
understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement 
our business models effectively . Any perception of our practices, products or services as an invasion of privacy , whether or not 
consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational 
harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to 
increased liability . Additionally , both laws regulating privacy and third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns 
could negatively affect the functionality of, and demand for, our products and services, thereby reducing our revenue.
On behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of 
end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail, 
point of sale, text messaging and call centers. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering 
adopting laws regarding the collection, storage, use and disclosure of this information. Our compliance with privacy laws and 
regulations and our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers’  adherence to privacy laws and regulations and 
their use of our services in ways consistent with such consumers’  expectations. We also rely on contractual representations made 
to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any 
applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. As a component of our standardized customer contract, 
we obligate customers to provide their consumers the opportunity to “opt out” of the information collection associated with our 
services, as applicable. We do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these 
representations are false or if our customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity 
and possible legal or other regulatory action. In addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the 
scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as Adobe, that would require additional compliance expense 
and increase our liability risk.
In the past we have relied on the U.S.-European Union and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks, as agreed to by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland, as a means to legally transfer EU citizens’  
personal information from the EU to the United States. However , on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated 
the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
framework. As a result, we have worked to establish alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the European 
Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States; however , we continue to face uncertainty as to the legitimacy of these alternate 
means. At least one regulator has determined that, with respect to a small number of vendors that process certain of our EU employee 
Table of Contents
27data, we did not implement these alternate means quickly enough, resulting in a fine levied against us. We are closely monitoring 
developments regarding requirements for transferring personal data outside the EU, such as Privacy Shield. These requirements 
may result in an increase in the obligations required of us to provide our services in the EU and in sanctions and fines for non-
compliance. These developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers 
effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
We contract with a number of software distributors, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our 
total net revenue for any recent period. Nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any 
prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and 
services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors 
and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel 
partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, 
export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior . We cannot be certain that our distribution 
channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively . If our distribution channel is not successful, we may 
lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. 
Our distributors also sell our competitors’  products and services, and if they favor our competitors’  products or services for 
any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, 
which would cause our results to suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs 
decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. 
In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. 
Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency 
and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. In addition, weakness 
in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations 
to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these 
distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to secure replacement distributors in a timely manner .
We also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel 
include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and 
motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover 
new and upgraded systems, products and services. Moreover , recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in 
most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity . Our business could be seriously harmed if 
our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies 
we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to 
certain accounts covered by such employees.
We also provide products and services, directly and indirectly , to a variety of government entities, both domestically and 
internationally . Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended 
sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and 
other government-specific contractual requirements. Ineffectively managing these risks could result in various civil and criminal 
penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from 
future government business, as well as harm to our reputation. 
We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. 
We rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect 
to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may 
not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. 
Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially 
if these third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical 
support providers, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose customers and associated revenue.
If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. 
These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could 
harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business 
Table of Contents
28is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. 
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in 
many areas where our employees are located. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our 
business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the 
effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic 
planning and execution.
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster 
innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow , including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired 
in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, 
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion 
of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income 
taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the 
subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our 
intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are 
repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates 
could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates 
in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes 
in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, the European Commission, countries in the EU and 
other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and 
interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could 
adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
(“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer 
pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to 
determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from the current 
examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse 
effect on our operating results and financial position.
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Because our products are distributed and used globally , our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the 
appropriate trade-of fs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies and we regularly review this hedging program and make 
adjustments as necessary based on the factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the 
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect 
our financial condition or results of operations.
If we fail to process transactions effectively , our revenue and earnings may be harmed.
We process a significant volume of transactions on a daily basis in our Digital Marketing and Digital Media businesses. 
Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential, but even the 
most sophisticated systems and controls may not be effective in preventing all errors. The systems supporting our business are 
comprised of multiple technology platforms that may be difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage these systems 
and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner , which may harm our customer 
relationships or results of operations.
Table of Contents
29Net revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to 
decline.
The market price for our common stock has in the past experienced significant fluctuations and may do so in the future. A 
number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:
• shortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), bookings within our Adobe 
Marketing Cloud business or other key performance metrics;
• changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
• whether our results meet analysts’  expectations;
• compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;
• the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;
• the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new 
customers;
• variations in our or our competitors’  results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and 
developments in our industry; and
• unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory , political or 
market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 
In addition, the technology industry as a whole may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market 
price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.
We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.
We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally . 
These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, 
data and transaction processing security , payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated 
content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency , corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, 
employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, 
securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations 
to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant 
costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability . Non-compliance could also result 
in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and 
damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become 
subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in U.S. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which 
laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those 
with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, 
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We cannot provide assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as 
well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries 
where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary , will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. 
laws and regulations. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business.
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, 
we are subject to a number of risks, including:
• foreign currency fluctuations;
• changes in government preferences for software procurement;
• international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;
• tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
Table of Contents
30• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
• changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
• failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
• inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;
• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology , tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
• the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand 
our business;
• costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;
• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
• other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, 
our revenue may decline.
In addition, approximately 53% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly , we are exposed to 
changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations 
regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy , unemployment tax rates, workers’  compensation 
rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. We 
may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. Expansion in international 
markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale 
our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these 
expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer. 
We have issued $1.9 billion  of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our 
financial condition and future financial results. 
We have $1.9 billion  in senior unsecured notes outstanding. We also have a $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit 
agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, 
among other things: 
• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby 
reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; 
and
• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry .
Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to 
maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our 
control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable 
cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. 
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our 
debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if 
our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility 
could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain 
additional financing in the future. 
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to 
earnings. 
Under GAAP , we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP  requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least 
annually . Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable 
intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth 
rates in our industry . We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period 
Table of Contents
31in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of 
operations. 
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology 
systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, 
some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities 
serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability . A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems 
or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, 
telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber -attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that 
our disaster recovery plans could not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual 
property , delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical 
data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’  orders or could negatively impact a country or region in 
which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’ s or region’ s demand for our products. Our corporate 
headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical 
business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations 
are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the 
destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect 
our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. 
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or 
for our vendors, is a priority .  Our major sites in California and India are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate 
change.  While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize 
that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted.  In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited 
access to these resources, Adobe has the potential to experience losses to our business, time required to recover , and added costs 
to resume operations.
Additionally , climate change may pose regulatory and environmental challenges that affect where we locate our offices, 
who we partner with, and how we deliver products and services to our customers. 
Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2016  consisted of corporate bonds and 
commercial paper , U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time 
deposits and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate 
our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer , 
as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising 
from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and 
expense to vary from expectations. As of December 2, 2016 , we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-
term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we 
cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability , and can provide no assurance that our investment 
portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, 
including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted 
litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by 
diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or 
resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual 
property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable 
terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our 
sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy 
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service 
agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

37ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF 
OPERA TIONS  
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
ACQUISITIONS 
During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million . During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable 
segment. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform 
company , for approximately $549 million  in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. The 
initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition 
date and the issuance of these financial statements. TubeMogul will be integrated into our Digital Marketing  reportable segment 
for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. 
CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules and regulations of 
the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, 
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially 
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and 
estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business 
combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and 
estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically , our assumptions, judgments and estimates 
relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of 
software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most 
of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-
contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer . 
Throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes 
allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently 
expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry 
needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer ’s life cycle.
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence  (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
Table of Contents
38revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the 
elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a 
particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future 
returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in 
accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by 
our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory 
in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated 
provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The 
amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product 
in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry 
environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of 
operations.
In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels 
are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, 
product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates 
are inherently subjective. Accordingly , if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which 
would impact the total net revenue we report.
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning 
on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through 
the end of the contractual service term. Over -usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which 
we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced 
in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such 
as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as 
contract milestones, when applicable.
Table of Contents
39Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition 
date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the 
acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. 
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical 
experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not 
limited to:
• future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and 
acquired developed technologies and patents;
• expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated 
cash flows from the projects when completed;
• the acquired company’ s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade 
name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’ s product portfolio; and
• discount rates.
In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue 
obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost 
build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. 
The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards 
assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees 
exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company 
has significant historical data on their employee’ s exercise behavior , then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired 
company’ s history . Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields 
implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to 
the binomial model.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates 
or actual results.
Goodwill Impairment
We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently , 
if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may 
exist. As part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the 
occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. This 
qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may include macroeconomic conditions, industry 
and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in 
strategy and changes in customers.
If the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we exercise judgment 
at various steps, including the identification of reporting segments, assignment of goodwill to reporting segments, and determination 
of the fair value of each reporting segment. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, 
consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine 
whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair 
value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a 
variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our 
business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgme nts and estimates we have made in the 
past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported 
financial results.
Table of Contents
40We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  and determined there was no impairment. 
The results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their 
carrying values.
Accounting for  Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates 
to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax 
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 
tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could 
be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and 
other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices 
as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the 
adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. 
We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly 
impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the 
amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results 
and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates 
of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our 
actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested 
are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. 
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates 
could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax 
rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions 
in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other 
countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and 
interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could 
adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.

RESUL TS OF  OPERA TIONS
Overview of 2016
For fiscal 2016, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our 
two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of 
products and solutions. 
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for 
creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and 
access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-
Table of Contents
41based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable point pricing for cost-sensitive 
customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises.  These Creative Cloud offerings address the 
multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed 
our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer 
base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing 
customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery 
and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to 
increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized 
ratably .
We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our 
Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile 
applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately 
subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements 
(“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products is now immaterial to our business.
We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the 
Adobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Adobe Acrobat provides reliable 
creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Adobe Document Cloud, which 
we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat 
DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enables users to create, review , approve, sign and track documents whether 
on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and 
perpetual licenses.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health 
and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and 
unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust 
our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2016 are 
based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2016 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:
  Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services

Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value 
+ 
Annual Creative ETLA  Contract Value 
Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services 
+
Annual Document Cloud ETLA  Contract Value
Digital Media ARRCreative ARR
+ 
Document Cloud ARR
Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2016 was $3.54 billion , up from $2.50 billion  at the end of fiscal 2015. Document Cloud ARR 
exiting fiscal 2016 was $475 million , up from $385 million  at the end of fiscal 2015. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $4.01 
billion  at the end of fiscal 2016, up from $2.88 billion  at the end of fiscal 2015. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2016 using 
currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2017, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2016 would be $3.99 billion  or 
approximately $27 million  lower than the ARR reported above.
Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2016 was 
$3.18 billion , up from $2.30 billion  in fiscal 2015 and representing 38% year-over -year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 
2016 was $764.9 million , slightly down from $792.3 million  in fiscal 2015 as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a 
subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $3.94 billion  in fiscal 2016, up from $3.10 billion  in fiscal 
2015 and representing 27% year-over -year growth.

customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized, relevant 
experience to their constituents.
In addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions include marketing 
professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. Customers also 
include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in workflows that 
utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. By combining 
the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more 
efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow 
and feedback loop.
We utilize a direct salesforce to market and license our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem 
of partners including marketing agencies, systems integrators and developers that help license and deploy our solutions to their 
customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent 
financial results reflect the success of these investments. In fiscal 2016, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 
billion , which represents 20% year-over -year revenue growth. In December 2016, we acquired TubeMogul and we will integrate 
TubeMogul in our Digital Marketing business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect that the addition of TubeMogul and 
sustained demand across our portfolio of Marketing Cloud solutions will drive revenue growth in future years.

Fiscal 2016  Revenue Compar ed to Fiscal 2015  Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased  $845.8 million  during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015 , primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings. 
Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetual creative and stock photography 
offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated 
with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, 
and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography 
Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative 
offerings. Increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our 
perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family , decreased slightly during fiscal 2016  as compared 
to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offering. Decreases 
were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate 
more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.
Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased  $227.7 million  during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to 
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe 
Marketing Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, increases 
in revenue associated with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign. 
Fiscal 2015 Revenue Compar ed to Fiscal 2014 Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to the strong adoption of Creative Cloud.  Document Cloud revenue 
remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as 
compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven 
by the increase in the number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. Increases associated with our 
creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family , remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to 
the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with Adobe Sign and our Document Cloud subscription offerings were 
offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud 
subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs.

45Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to 
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared to fiscal 2014. 
Contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our AEM term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in 
revenue associated with Adobe Campaign, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target.

Fiscal 2016  Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2015  Revenue by Geography
Overall revenue during fiscal 2016 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases 
in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue, slightly offset by the decrease in Print and Publishing revenue. Within each 
geographic region, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information 
above. Further , the overall increase in EMEA  revenue was partially offset by declines due to the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar 
against EMEA  currencies as discussed below .
Fiscal 2015 Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography
Revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 while revenue in APAC 
remained stable during fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA  increased primarily due to 
growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. The overall increase in EMEA  revenue was slightly offset by declines 
due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA  currencies in fiscal 2015. Within the 
Americas and EMEA, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information 
above.
 Revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing 
revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue.The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the

 During fiscal 2016 , the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro and British Pound which negatively impacted revenue 
in EMEA  measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA  currencies 
hedging programs during fiscal 2016 . During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Japanese Yen, the impact of which 
was offset by the impact of the U.S. Dollar strengthening against other Asian currencies.
During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies 
which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA  and APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by 
hedging gains from our EMEA  currencies and Japanese Yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015. 
See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.
Backlog
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue 
recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year , non-
cancelable commercial subscription, SAAS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. 
Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, 
SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial 
statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry . As of 
December 2, 2016 , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.4 billion  of which approximately 40% to 50% 
is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. Comparatively , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of 
approximately $2.9 billion  as of November 27, 2015, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be 
billed during fiscal 2016. 
We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, 
including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles 
of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes 
in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally , the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for 
multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior 
to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly , fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog 
may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, 
including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and 
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of 
intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for the use of their data center facilities and 
our data center costs largely consist of amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.

Data center costs increased during fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the continued increase in transaction 
volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Increases in data center costs were partially offset by decreases 
in amortization of purchased intangibles driven by the decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased 
through our acquisitions of Omniture and Efficient Frontier that became fully amortized in the latter part of fiscal 2015. 
Data center costs increased during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our 
Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures  
as we invested in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. 
Royalty costs increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings and increased royalties 
due to the introduction of our stock photography offering. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to 
amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.

decreases were partially offset by an increase in royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering. 
Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and 
obsolete inventory , cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. The 
increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition 
of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.

Resear ch and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses 
The increase in research and development, sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016 
as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the increase in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by 
increased headcount.
Research and development and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 
2014 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. General and administrative 
expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated 
loss associated with certain legal proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with 
headcount. 
Resear ch and Development 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted

Amortization of Pur chased Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of 
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 
fourteen  years.
Amortization expense increased  during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to write-of f of certain acquired 
intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased 
in fiscal 2016.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense 
associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in 
amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day 
Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.

foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
Interest and other income (expense), net decreased  in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the gain on the sale of 
certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and the increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset by the increase in 
interest income due to increased average investment balance and interest rates. 
Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on

Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
Inter est Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior 
notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are 
paid monthly . The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest 
payments.  See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate 
swaps.  
Interest expense increased  during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in floating rate on 
interest rate swap and higher average debt balances.
Interest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially 
offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps.  
Investment Gains (Losses), Net
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, 
other -than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and 
losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with 
our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.

Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. 
The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and 
the permanent extension of the U.S. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was 
retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 effective 
tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’ s trading companies, offset by 
tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development credit in December 2014.
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The 
increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’ s trading companies. The 
increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in 
December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014. 
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested 
are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently , there 
is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.  
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016  was $178.4 million , exclusive of interest and penalties. 
If the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016  were recognized in the future, $144.5 million  of unrecognized tax 
benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $33.9 million  federal benefit related to deducting certain 
payments on future federal and state tax returns.
As of December 2, 2016 , the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax 
returns was approximately $22.4 million . This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current 
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million .
During fiscal 2016, a number of income tax examinations covering our fiscal years 2010 to 2016 were completed. Of the 
significant examinations, accrued tax and interest related to these years were $95.6 million and were previously reported in non-
current income taxes payable.  We settled the tax obligation resulting from these examinations with cash and income tax assets 
totaling $35.3 million, and the resulting $60.3 million income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal 2016.

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 134.8 $ (240.8 )$ 282.8 
Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating 
expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation 
in the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee options. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, 
which is described below , business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. 
Cash Flows fr om Operating Activities
For fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative 
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the 
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount.  The primary working 
capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes 
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 
primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of  fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due 
to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. 
For fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions 
for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase 
in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily 
due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The 
primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels. 
For fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA  activity 
for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted 
services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we 
discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee 
transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 
Table of Contents
54Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments.  Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other 
assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. 
For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion  was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments 
and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-
term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and 
proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for 
more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively .
For fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales 
and maturities of short-term investments.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For  fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion  was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock 
repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock 
and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million .  In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million .  Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method.  The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
We used $600 million  of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and 
unpaid interest of the $600 million  3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used 
for general corporate purposes.  See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. 
In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 also include 
payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds 
from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
For  fiscal 2014, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million  was primarily due to payments for our treasury 
stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury 
stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
See the section titled “Stock Repur chase Program” discussed below .
We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities 
expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and 
administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to 
strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. 
Other  Liquidity and Capital Resour ces Considerations
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2017 due to changes in our planned 
cash outlay , including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and 
investments totaled $4.76 billion  as of December 2, 2016 . Of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from 
foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our 
domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax 
has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating 
these funds.
Table of Contents
55Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed 
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However , based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our 
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility 
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. 
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit 
Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into 
an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the 
syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 2, 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under 
this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. 
As of December 2, 2016 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion , consisting of $900 million  of 
4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion  of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together 
with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). 
Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform 
company , for approximately $549 million  in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. See 
Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper , U.S. agency securities 
and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.W e use professional 
investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 
61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016 . 
Stock Repur chase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the 
first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up 
to $2 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. 
During fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion , $625 million  and $600 million , respectively . 
The prepayments of $1.08 billion  made during fiscal 2016  were under the current $2 billion  authority . Of the prepayments of $625 
million  made during fiscal 2015 , $425 million  were under the current $2 billion  authority and $200 million  were under the previous 
$2 billion  authority . The prepayments of $600 million  made during fiscal 2014  were under the previous $2 billion  authority . We 
enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted 
Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the 
discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There 
were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement 
for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 10.4 million  shares at an average price of $97.16  through structured 
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 
million  shares at an average price of $77.38  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 
2014 . During fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 10.9 million  shares at an average price per share of $63.48  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013. 
For fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2016 , November 27, 2015  and November 28, 
2014  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2016 , $100.1 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , as part of our current $2 billion  stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured 
stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million . 
This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200 million  stock  
repurchase agreement, $300 million  remains under our current authority .
Table of Contents
56Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority 
to repurchase up to $2.5 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by 
our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggr egate Contractual Obligations
 Our principal commitments as of December 2, 2016  consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and 
various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding 
our contractual commitments.

Senior Notes
As of December 2, 2016 , our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying 
value of $1.90 billion .  Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 2, 
2016 , our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $425.9 million  for the remaining duration of our 
Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a 
floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 
1, 2020.
Covenants
Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower 
lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly .  As of December 2, 
2016 , we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming 
fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. 
Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless 
payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable 
future.

57Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016  was $178.4 million , exclusive of interest and penalties. 
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process.  These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current 
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million .  
Royalties
We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based 
on a dollar amount per unit, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for 
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director ’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT  MARKET  RISK
All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Curr ency Risk
Foreign Curr ency Exposur es and Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us 
to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge 
our foreign currency revenue. Additionally , we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign 
exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected 
by changes in exchange rates. 
Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  were as follows (in millions, except 
Yen):
Fiscal
2016Fiscal
2015Fiscal
2014
Euro € 825.6 € 589.6 € 455.5
Yen (in billions) ¥ 38.7 ¥ 29.7 ¥ 28.0
British Pounds £ 263.5 £ 192.0 £ 159.1
Table of Contents
58As of December 2, 2016 , the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and 
forwards, was $891.2 million  which included the notional equivalent of $476.6 million  in Euros, $152.4 million  in British Pounds, 
$181.2 million  in Yen and $81.0 million  in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2016 , all contracts were set to expire at 
various dates through June 2017. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would 
be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value 
of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements 
which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2016 . This sensitivity 
analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. 
Dollar . For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our 
financial hedging instruments by $56.6 million . Conversely , a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a 
decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $37.9 million .
As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in 
countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the 
local currency denominated operating expenses. 
We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar 
functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015 , this long-term investment exposure 
totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $70.2 million  and $61.9 million , respectively . At this time, we do not hedge these long-
term investment exposures.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure 
in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and 
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Curr ency Revenue 
We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in 
Euros, British Pounds and Yen.  We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be 
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities 
between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course 
of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow 
hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it will not occur , 
we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and 
other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2016 , there were 
no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur .
Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, 
net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 
gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 2, 
2016 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.

At December 2, 2016 , we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.75 billion . Changes in interest rates 
could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated 
maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):
Due within one year $ 1,230.4
Due between one and two years 1,322.9
Due between two and three years 782.9
Due after three years 413.8
Total $ 3,750.0
A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2016 . The analysis is based on an 
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield 
curve of various magnitudes.
The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming 
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.  The analysis is shown as of 
December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015  (dollars in millions):
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
12/2/16 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,828.5 $ 3,805.9 $ 3,778.4 $ 3,750.0 $ 3,721.6 $ 3,693.2 $ 3,664.8
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/27/15 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,172.3 $ 3,156.6 $ 3,135.2 $ 3,111.5 $ 3,087.7 $ 3,063.9 $ 3,040.1
Senior Notes
As of December 2, 2016 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.90 billion . In June 2014, we entered into 
interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR 
plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly , our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million . An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest 
rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of December 2, 2016 , the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.90 billion  and the related fair value based on  
observable market prices in less active markets was $1.97 billion .
Other  Market Risk
Privately Held Long-T erm Investments
The privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are 
inherently risky . The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may 
never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of 
privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure 
regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy 
of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies 
as these investments were insignificant as of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015 .

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF  PRESENT ATION AND SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operations
Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. 
We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, 
enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and 
experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise 
customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We offer many 
of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted 
or cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain products and services 
through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors 
(“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology 
to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run 
on personal and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have 
operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). 
Basis of Pr esentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all 
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations 
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use of Estimates
In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules 
and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-
based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase 
commitments, restructuring charges, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes 
and investments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal Y ear
Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 
2016   benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 
is a 53-week fiscal year compared with fiscal 2015  and 2014  which were 52-week fiscal years.
Reclassifications
Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing of 
software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most 
of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-
contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer . 
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
67Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
Multiple Element Arrangements
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements 
in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses. 
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Subscription and Services and Support Revenue
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning 
on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through 
the end of the contractual service term. Over -usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which 
we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced 
in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

68Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to 
the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and 
developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.
Our consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, 
such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable. 
Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when 
and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the 
arrangement.
Our software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available 
basis, hosted services, and online storage are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize 
revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.
Product Revenue
We recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop 
application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. 
Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly , we reduce revenue recognized for estimated 
future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted 
periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.
We recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided 
collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing 
of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting 
by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately 
received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.
Our product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license 
agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item 
as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade 
to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the 
right to the specified free upgrade expires.
Rights of Return, Rebates and Price Pr otection
As discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies 
and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as 
an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:
• Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter . In addition, distributors 
are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being 
replaced by new versions.
• We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for 
distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting 
period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced 
is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using 
historical trends.
• From time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently 
reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the 
difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior to 
the effective date of the decrease.

69Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel 
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a 
customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends 
and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to 
determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future 
returns. When necessary , we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated 
requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product 
plans and other factors.

Deferr ed Revenue
 Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions 
described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. 
The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering 
such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions 
that may affect a customer ’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.

Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment 
as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements 
and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the 
remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.

70Goodwill, Pur chased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment 
annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year. In performing our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to 
determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a 
reporting segment below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may 
include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in 
management or key personnel, changes in strategy , changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a 
reporting segments’  net assets, and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine 
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting segments are greater than the carrying amounts, then the two-step 
goodwill impairment test is not performed.
If the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we evaluate goodwill 
for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated 
goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded 
companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow 
assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We determined, after performing 
a qualitative review of each reporting segment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segments 
substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly , there was no indication of impairment, and the two-step 
goodwill impairment test was not performed. 
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever 
an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts 
of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances 
occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted 
expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize 
an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible 
asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 , 2015  or 2014 .
During fiscal 2016 , our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. 
Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line 
basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:
 Weighted 
Average

Customer contracts and relationships 8
Trademarks 8
Acquired rights to use technology 9

Softwar e Development Costs
Capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins upon the 
establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as 
having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use, generally 
based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. To date, software development costs incurred between 
completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material.
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
71Internal Use Softwar e
We capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development 
stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and 
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development of the applications. Capitalization of 
such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially 
complete and is ready for its intended purpose.
Income T axes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, 
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount 
for which realization is more likely than not.
Taxes Collected from Customers
We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. 
Accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the 
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is 
re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that 
there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses 
upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  were $135.8 million , 
$113.6 million  and $87.9 million , respectively .
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency , at exchange 
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include 
accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss).
Foreign Curr ency and Other Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign 
exchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge our net recognized 
foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows 
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them 
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and 
whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.
Gains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each 
period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option 
contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of

72tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’  equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted 
transactions occur .
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, 
structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.
Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. 
Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy . 
Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of 
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
We enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the 
event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received 
or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, 
we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty 
by permitting net settlement transactions. 
The aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 
2015  was $38.1 million  and $19.1 million  respectively . These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting 
date as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial 
liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. 
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, 
customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, 
dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and require letters of credit 
or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary . The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their 
ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments 
from their customers. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the 
customer ’s ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to 
recognizing the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.
We derive a significant portion of our OEM PostScript and Other licensing revenue from a small number of OEMs. Our 
OEMs on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an 
agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
There have been no new accounting pronouncements made effective during fiscal 2016 that have significance, or potential 
significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The 
updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP  when it becomes effective and permits 
the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue 
standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than 
the original effective date. Accordingly , the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and we do not 
plan to early adopt. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard 
will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe the most significant impact 
relates to our accounting for arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance and support. Under 
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
73current GAAP , the revenue attributable to these software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because 
VSOE does not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately . The requirement to have 
VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated under the 
new standard. Accordingly , under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the arrangement fee 
upon delivery of the software license. While we currently expect revenue related to our professional services and cloud offerings 
for business enterprises, individuals and teams to remain substantially unchanged, we are still in the process of evaluating the 
impact of the new standard on these arrangements.Due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition 
treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some 
instances.
On February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and 
a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases. For lessees, leases will continue to be 
classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but 
updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. Lessors will continue to classify leases as operating, direct financing 
or sales-type leases. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified 
retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. 
The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect that the 
updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, 
which simplifies various aspects related to the accounting and presentation of share-based payments. The amendments require 
entities to record all tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement or expiration through the income statement and the 
windfall tax benefit to be recorded when it arises, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations. All tax-related cash flows 
resulting from share-based payments are required to be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The updates 
relating to the income tax effects of the share-based payments including the cash flow presentation must be adopted either 
prospectively or retrospectively . Further , the amendments allow the entities to make an accounting policy election to either estimate 
forfeitures or recognize forfeitures as they occur . If an election is made, the change to recognize forfeitures as they occur must be 
adopted using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings. The 
effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods 
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
We will early adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We believe the new standard will cause volatility 
in our effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share due to the tax effects related to share-based payments being recorded to 
the income statement. The volatility in future periods will depend on our stock price at the awards’  vest dates and the number of 
awards that vest in each period. Further , we will not elect an accounting policy change to record forfeitures as they occur and will 
continue to estimate forfeitures at each period. 
With the exception of the updated standards discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet 
effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 2.   ACQUISITIONS
Fotolia
On January 27, 2015 , we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we began integrating Fotolia into our Digital Media 
reportable segment. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and 
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015 . During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase 
accounting adjustments based on changes to management’ s estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, 
calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million  of 
which $745.1 million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million  to identifiable intangible 
assets and $142.0 million  to net liabilities assumed.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
74We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
TubeMogul
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform 
company , for approximately $549 million  in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. The 
initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition 
date and the issuance of these financial statements. TubeMogul will be integrated into our Digital Marketing reportable segment 
for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
NOTE 3.  CASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND SHOR T-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify 
all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as “available-for -sale.” In general, these investments are free of trading 
restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. 
Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as 
a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized 
in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other -than-temporary decline in fair value has 
occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using 
the specific identification method.

of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the 
issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the 
investment’ s amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other -than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write 
down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded 
to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded 
to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our 
Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2016 , we recorded immaterial other -than-temporary impairment losses 
associated with certain of our fixed income securities and wrote down the securities to fair value. During fiscal 2015  and 2014 , 
we did not consider any of our investments to be other -than-temporarily impaired.

See Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
Our fixed income available-for -sale debt securities consist of high quality , investment grade securities from diverse issuers 
with a minimum credit rating of BBB- and a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing 
from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that 
model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow 
methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are 
observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value,  including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, 
interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for -sale securities as Level 
2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate 
fair values are recorded.

79The fair values of our money market mutual funds and time deposits are based on the closing price of these assets as of the 
reporting date. We classify our money market mutual funds and time deposits as Level 1. 
Our Level 2 over-the-counter foreign currency and interest rate swap derivatives are valued using pricing models and 
discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.
Our deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market mutual funds and other mutual funds.
Assets and Liabilities Measur ed at Fair Value on a Nonr ecurring Basis
We also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost method, which are periodically 
assessed for other -than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other -than-temporary impairment has occurred, we write 
down the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost method investments considering available information 
such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance 
and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2016 , we determined there were immaterial other -than-temporary 
impairments on certain of our cost method investments and wrote down the investments to fair value. During fiscal 2015 , we 
determined there were no other -than-temporary impairments on our cost method investments.
As of December 2, 2016 , the carrying value of our lease receivables approximated fair value, based on Level 2 valuation 
inputs which include Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) interest rates and applicable credit spreads. See 
Note 14 for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables. 
The fair value of our senior notes was $1.97 billion  as of December 2, 2016 , based on observable market prices in less 
active markets and categorized as Level 2. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.
NOTE 5.  DERIV ATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Hedge Accounting and Hedging Pr ograms
We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of 
the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively , and record any 
ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of 
Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness 
was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income 
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which 
are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value 
of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
of transactions. Our hedging policy also establishes maximum limits for each counterparty to mitigate any concentration of risk.
Balance Sheet Hedging —Hedges of For eign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes 
in the fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts 
do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are 
intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged.

80Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of For ecasted For eign Curr ency Revenue and Inter est Rate Risks
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use 
foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these 
foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months . 
We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the 
normal course of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, 
and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in 
the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on 
the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it 
will not occur , we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge 
accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are 
recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
In December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a 
notional amount of $600 million  to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark 
interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. Upon issuance of our $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due 
February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in January 2015, we terminated the instrument and incurred a loss of $16.2 million . This loss 
was recorded in the stockholders’  equity section in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss) and will be reclassified to interest expense over a ten-year term consistent with the impact of the hedged item. See Note 15 
for further details regarding our debt.
For fiscal 2016 , there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions 
that did not occur . In fiscal 2015  and 2014  these net gains or losses were immaterial.
Fair V alue Hedging—Hedges of Inter est Rate Risks
During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our 
$900 million  of 4.75%  fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps 
convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we 
will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount 
through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 15 for 
further details regarding our debt.
The interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged 
portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements 
of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 2, 2016 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $313.8 million  which included the notional 
equivalent of $152.8 million  in Euros, $33.6 million  in British Pounds, $46.5 million  in Japanese Yen, $26.4 million  in Indian 
Rupees, and $54.5 million  in other foreign currencies. As of November 27, 2015 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts 
were $228.3 million  which included the notional equivalent of $75.8 million  in Euros, $44.3 million  in British Pounds, $37.8 
million  in Australian Dollars, $28.8 million  in Japanese Yen, and $41.6 million  in other foreign currencies. At December 2, 2016
and November 27, 2015 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management approved a plan to sell land and an unoccupied building located in San 
Jose, California. The total carrying value of the property assets was $36.3 million  which mostly pertained to the land. The decision 
to sell these property assets was largely based upon a general lack of operational needs for the building and land, and improvements 
in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area. We began to actively market the assets during the second quarter of 
fiscal 2015 and finalized the sale of these assets on September 23, 2015 for total proceeds of $57.8 million . The gain on the sale 
of the property assets was included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

86Deferr ed Tax Assets and Liabilities
The tax effects of the temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015  are presented below (in thousands):

Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 292,844 249,159
Acquired intangible assets 120,698 159,415
Total deferred tax liabilities 492,161 470,717
Net deferred tax liabilities $217,660 $208,209
The deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2016  and 2015  include amounts related to various acquisitions.  The total 
change in deferred tax assets and liabilities includes changes that are recorded to other comprehensive income, additional paid-
in capital, goodwill, unrecognized tax benefits and retained earnings.
We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered 
permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently 
reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of 
December 2, 2016 , the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately 
$4.2 billion . The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $1.1 billion .
As of December 2, 2016 , we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $83.5 million  for federal and $36.4 
million  for state. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $70.6 million  and $17.4 million , 
respectively . The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2017  through 2035 . 
The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely . The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits 
are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be fully realized.
In addition, we have been tracking certain deferred tax attributes of approximately $55.3 million  which have not been 
recorded in the financial statements pursuant to accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. Pursuant to these 
standards, the benefit of these deferred tax assets is not recorded to equity unless it reduces taxes payable.
As of December 2, 2016 , a valuation allowance of $24.3 million  has been established for certain deferred tax assets related 
to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2016 , the total change in the valuation allowance 
was immaterial.

87Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
During fiscal 2016  and 2015 , our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized 
as follows (in thousands):
  2016 2015
Beginning balance $258,718 $148,848
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions 6,047 3,784
Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions (67,870 ) —
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions 23,068 129,358
Settlements with taxing authorities (33,265 ) (11,548 )
Lapse of statute of limitations (8,456 ) (2,687 )
Foreign exchange gains and losses 171 (9,037 )
Ending balance $178,413 $258,718
As of December 2, 2016 , the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax 
returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was approximately $22.4 million .
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are 
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our 
major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest 
fiscal years open for examination are 2008 , 2010  and 2013 , respectively . We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting 
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments 
that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , there can be no assurance 
that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial 
position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process.  These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current 
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $10 million . 
NOTE 10.  BENEFIT  PLANS
Retir ement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings 
Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary , subject to the Internal Revenue 
Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2016 , we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’ s eligible compensation. We 
contributed $33.4 million , $25.7 million  and $24.8 million  in fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , respectively . We are under no obligation 
to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.
Deferr ed Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, 
effective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, 
deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a 
portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100%  of other specified 
compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’  
fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan 
year in which election is made. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in the form of a lump sum or annual installments 
Table of Contents

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
88over five years. For stock benefit elections, distributions are made in the form of a lump sum payment only. Prior to fiscal 2015, 
cash distributions were  received in the form of a lump sum payment if the retirement definition was not met upon the participant’ s 
termination. Beginning in fiscal 2015, participants have the option to have their cash benefit elections distributed as a lump sum, 
or annual installments over either five, ten or fifteen years following the participant’ s termination. All distributions will be made 
in cash, except for deferred performance-based and time-based restricted stock units which will be settled in stock. 
As of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015 , the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $42.2 
million  and $32.1 million , respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 
2016  and November 27, 2015 , $49.0 million  and $39.6 million , respectively , was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize 
undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.
NOTE 1 1.  ST OCK-BASED COMPENSA TION
Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide 
incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-
based compensation plans and programs:
Restricted Stock Unit Plan
We grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 Plan”). 
Restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process vest annually over three years. Other restricted stock units 
generally vest over four years, the majority of which vest 25% annually . Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by 
our Board of Directors or an authorized committee.
We grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan which cliff-vest after three years. 
As of December 2, 2016 , we had reserved 183.2 million  shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and had 
89.0 million  shares available for grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common 
stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP  consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month 
purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our 
common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower . The ESPP  
will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under 
the plan have been issued.
As of December 2, 2016 , we had reserved 93.0 million  shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP  and 
approximately 8.9 million  shares remain available for future issuance.
Stock Option Plan
The 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-
employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the 
shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods 
used in the past were generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant. 
We eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors 
effective fiscal 2014, but may choose to issue stock options in the future.  
Performance Shar e Programs
Our 2016, 2015 and 2014 Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, 
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to 
attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors 
approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology , under the terms of 
our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
89measured over a three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the Executive 
Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement following the three-year anniversary of each grant date. 
Program participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares originally granted.
On January 24, 2016, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2016 Performance Share Program, the terms 
of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. As of December 2, 2016 , the shares awarded 
under our 2016 , 2015  and 2014  Performance Share Programs are yet to be achieved.
Issuance of Shares
Upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the 
ESPP , we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact 
of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a 
stock repurchase program. See Note 12 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. 
Our performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at 
grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP  shares. The determination of the fair 
value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as 
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility 
over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and 
any expected dividends.
The expected term of ESPP  shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period. The 
assumptions used to value employee stock purchase rights were as follows:
Fiscal Years
  2016 2015 2014
Expected life (in years) 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0

The weighted average subscription date fair value of shares under the ESPP  during fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  were $24.84 , 
$20.81  and $17.02 , respectively . Employees purchased 1.9 million  shares at an average price of $66.13 , 2.1 million  shares at an 
average price of $52.37 , and 2.9 million  shares at an average price of $34.76 , respectively , for fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 . The 
intrinsic value of shares purchased during fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  was $54.3 million , $53.9 million  and $93.4 million , 
respectively . The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of purchase and the purchase 
price of the shares.
Summary of Stock Options  
As of  December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015, we had 0.6 million  and 1.3 million  stock options outstanding, respectively . 
Grants to Executive Officers
All equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors  
Although the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee 
directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors since fiscal 2014. The initial equity 
grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million  based on the 
average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%  on the day preceding the 
next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual 
meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled. 
Annual equity grants to non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units shall have an aggregate value of $0.3 
million  as based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%
on the day preceding the next annual meeting. 
Restricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  were as follows (in thousands):
  2016 2015 2014
Restricted stock units granted to existing directors 25 41 48
Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is 
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award. The fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  awards are earned upon achievement of an 
objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance period, as described above.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from 
those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards 
that are expected to vest.
As of December 2, 2016 , there was $476.8 million  of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, 
related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Total unrecognized 
compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Repur chase Program  
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the 
first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up 
to $2 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. 
During fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion , $625 million , and $600 million , respectively . 
The $1.08 billion  prepayments during fiscal 2016  were under the current $2 billion  authority . Of the prepayments of $625.0 million
made during fiscal 2015 , $425.0 million  were under the current $2 billion  authority and $200.0 million  were under the previous 
$2 billion  authority . The $600 million  prepayments made during fiscal 2014  were under the previous $2 billion  authority . We enter 
into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average 
Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount 
that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. 
There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no 
requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 10.4 million  shares at an average price of $97.16  through structured 
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 
million  shares at an average price of $77.38  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 
2014 . During fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 10.9 million  shares at an average price per share of $63.48  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013. 
For fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2016 , November 27, 2015  and November 28, 
2014  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2016 , $100.1 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement.

94Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , as part of our current $2 billion  stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured 
stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million . 
This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200 million  stock 
repurchase agreement, $300 million  remains under our current authority . 
Subsequent to December 2, 2016 , the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority 
to repurchase up to $2.5 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by 
our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
NOTE 13.  NET  INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, 
excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average 
common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, 
performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2016 , 2015  and 2014  (in 
thousands, except per share data):
  2016 2015 2014
Net income $1,168,782 $629,551 $268,395
Shares used to compute basic net income per share 498,345 498,764 497,867
Dilutive potential common shares:
Unvested restricted stock units and performance share awards 5,455 7,389 8,586
Stock options 499 1,011 2,027
Shares used to compute diluted net income per share 504,299 507,164 508,480
Basic net income per share $ 2.35 $ 1.26 $ 0.54
Diluted net income per share $ 2.32 $ 1.24 $ 0.53
For fiscal 2016  and 2015 , there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the 
average fair market value of our stock of $96.39  and $79.22 , respectively , that would have been anti-dilutive.
For fiscal 2014 , options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value 
of our stock of $65.93  were not included in the calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The number of shares 
of common stock under these options was immaterial.
NOTE 14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 Lease Commitments
We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire 
at various dates through 2031 . We also have one land lease that expires in 2091 . Rent expense includes base contractual rent and 
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was 
approximately $92.9 million  in both fiscal 2016  and 2015 , and $111.1 million  in fiscal 2014 . Our sublease income was immaterial 
for all periods presented.
We occupy three  office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these 
office buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. We own the land and the East and West Tower buildings, 
and lease the Almaden Tower building. 
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
95The lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable 
related to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of $80.4 million , which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of December 2, 2016 , the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower 
approximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower , we have the option to purchase the building at any time 
during the lease term for $103.6 million . If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against 
the purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is $89.4 million . 
The Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor 
quarterly . As of December 2, 2016 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may demand 
we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. If we 
choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an 
unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, 
up to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable.  The Almaden Tower lease qualifies for operating 
lease accounting treatment and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.  
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of 
the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2016  (in thousands):

Thereafter — 177,509 —
Total $ 300,969 $ 377,414 $ 6,819
Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a 
dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of revenue 
on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $79.8 million , $62.3 million  and $45.2 million  in fiscal 2016 , 2015
and 2014 , respectively .
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for 
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director ’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
96future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We 
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including 
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past 
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes 
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent 
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products 
or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification 
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
 In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our 
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

97NOTE 15.  DEBT
Our long-term debt as of December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015  consisted of the following (in thousands):
  2016 2015
Notes $ 1,888,951 $ 1,887,410
Fair value of interest rate swap 13,117 19,821
Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,902,068 1,907,231
Senior Notes
 In February 2010, we issued $600 million  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2015  (the “2015 Notes”) and $900 million
of 4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). Our proceeds were $1.5 billion  and were net of an issuance 
discount of $6.6 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $10.7 million . Both the discount and issuance costs were or 
are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2015 and 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. 
The 2015 and 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate 
including the discount and issuance costs was 3.45%  for the 2015 Notes and is 4.92%  for the 2020 Notes. Interest is payable semi-
annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010 . The 2015 Notes were settled on February 1, 
2015 , as discussed below .
In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million  designated as a fair value 
hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating 
interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at 
the one-month LIBOR floating interest rate plus a spread of a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount. 
In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our 
interest rate swap derivatives.
In December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a 
notional amount of $600 million  to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark 
interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate lock 
agreement.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million . Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective 
interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67%  for the 2025 Notes. Interest is payable 
semi-annually , in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2015 . A portion of the proceeds from this offering 
was used to repay $600 million  in aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due February 1, 
2015 . The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
As of December 2, 2016 , our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) with a 
total carrying value of $1.90 billion . Based on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.97 billion  as 
of December 2, 2016 . The total fair value of $1.97 billion  excludes the effect of fair value hedge of the 2020 Notes for which we 
entered into interest rate swaps as described above. 
We may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change 
of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on 
assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of December 2, 2016 , we were in 
compliance with all of the covenants.
In February 2016 and August 2016, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes each totaling 
$37.6 million .

98Credit Agreement
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, 
subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, request up to an additional $500 million  in commitments, for a maximum 
aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion . Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, 
based on our public debt ratings, ranging from 0.795%  and 1.3%  or (ii) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the 
agent’ s prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%  or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%  plus a margin, based on our debt 
ratings, ranging from 0.00%  to 0.30% . Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.08%  and 0.20%  per year, also 
based on our debt ratings. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated 
as additional borrowers may borrow , prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term 
of the Credit Agreement. 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a 
financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include 
restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other 
matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a 
maximum leverage ratio. 
 On March 1, 2013, we exercised an option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement 
by one year to March 2, 2018. 
On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 
2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. 
The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the 
commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date 
is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.
As of December 2, 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and we were in compliance 
with all covenants.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Adobe Systems Incorporated:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of 
December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’  
equity , and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 2, 2016. We also have audited Adobe Systems 
Incorporated’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Adobe Systems Incorporated’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 
9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial 
position of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 2, 2016, in conformity with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Adobe Systems Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosur e Contr ols and Procedur es
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 2, 2016 . Based on their evaluation 
as of December 2, 2016 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective 
at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-
K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’ s rules and regulations and 
(ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no 
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control 
system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of 
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.
Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness 
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2016 . In making this assessment, our management used the 
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Our management has concluded that, 
as of December 2, 2016 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 2, 2016  that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMA TION
 Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) 
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are required to disclose in our annual or quarterly reports whether we or 
any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities 
subject to sanctions under U.S. law. 
 During our first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we determined that a representative of the Paris branch of Bank Melli purchased 
a year-long subscription to Adobe Export PDF, a software service we provide.  On January 16, 2016, Bank Melli was removed 
from the U.S. Treasury Department’ s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OF AC”) Specially Designated National List; however , 
it remains an entity whose property and interests in property must be blocked by U.S. persons pursuant to Executive Order 13599. 
Upon further investigation and verification of the identity of the entity , we promptly deactivated the account. 
 Adobe’ s total revenue from this transaction was 24.34€, which is approximately U.S. $27.00 at the exchange rate for 
U.S. dollars on the transaction date of February 2, 2016. We are unable to determine the net profits attributable to this transaction, 
but such net profits would be less than the total revenue. Adobe does not intend to continue this activity in the future, and we are 
reviewing our internal compliance policies and processes to determine how to prevent a reoccurrence. Furthermore, we have 
voluntarily disclosed this matter to OFAC and intend to cooperate fully with regulatory inquiries, if any.
