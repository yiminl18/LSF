Business ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix
”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet television network with over 93 million streaming members in over190 
countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members canwatch as much as they want, anyti
me, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercialsor commitments. Additiona
lly, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.We are a pioneer in th
e internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed anecosystem for interne
t-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on theirinternet-connected s
creens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows andmovies directly over th
e internet.Our core strategy is to grow our st
reaming membership business globally within the parameters of our profit margin targets. We are continuously improvingour members' experienc
e by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we areperpetually enhancing our us
er interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can now download a selection oftitles for offline viewing.
We continue to grow our strea
ming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have sincelaunched our service globa
lly, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have alsoexpanded our streaming cont
ent offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Awardnominated original ser
ies and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three reportab
le segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derivesrevenues from monthly me
mbership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streamingsegment derives revenues 
from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. TheDomestic DVD segment derives revenu
es from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding oursegments, including inform
ation about our financial results by geography, see Note 11 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 1

Table of ContentsCOMPETITION
The market for entertainment vi
deo is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such asmultichannel video progr
amming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), videogaming providers and DVD rental outl
ets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.We also compete agains
t entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original contentprojects.
While consumers may ma
intain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments offree time. We have o
ften referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, weare continually improv
ing our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own originalprogramming.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a s
easonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increasetheir viewing. Historical
ly, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and Internationalstreaming segments. O
ur membership growth may be impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Internationally, we expect each market todemonstrate more pred
ictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess suchpatterns.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectualproperty as important to ou
r success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect ourproprietary intellectual property
. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounterdisputes over rights and obliga
tions concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.EMPLOYEES
As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had approximately 4,700 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 4,500 were full-time, inc luding approximately1,300 
categorized as temporary. OTHER INFORMATION

laware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, Ca
lifornia 95032, and our telephone number is (408) 540-3700.We maintain a Web site at

Risk Factors If any of the following risks ac
tually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline, and you could 
lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business
If our efforts to attract and re
tain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We have experienced sign
ificant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our abilityto consistently provide our m
embers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.Furthermore, the relative ser
vice levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract andretain memberships. Compe
titors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including thosethat provide pirated con
tent) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjustexisting features, adjus
t pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attractand retain members. In 
addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts tosatisfy our existing memb
ers are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will beadversely affected. M
embers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut householdexpenses, availability of
 content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorilyresolved. We must continua
lly add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If wedo not grow as expected, given, in par
ticular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust ourexpenditures or increas
e our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation maybe adversely impacted. 
If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting newmemberships, our business will be 
adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantlyhigher marketing expendit
ures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.Changes in competitive offerings for ent
ertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impactour business.
The market for enter
tainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers haveincreasing options to acc
ess entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported andpiracy-based models. 
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damageour business, as its fundamenta
l proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light ofthe compelling consumer p
roposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters andcable network operators
, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long oper
ating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may securebetter terms from supp
liers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions andmarketing. New entrants may 
enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approa ches to providing entertainmentvideo. Companies also may ente
r into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitablycompete with current and n
ew competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues orprofitability.
 
The long-term and fixed cost nature of our content com
mitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results ofoperations.
In connection with obtaining st
reaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment termsof which are not tied to me
mber usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatricalexhibition receipts. Such co
mmitments are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 . Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature ofcontent commitments, 
if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be3

Table of Contentsadversely impacted. Payme
nt terms for certain content commitments, such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service(“original programming”), 
will typically require more up-front cash payments than other licensing agreements. To the extent membership and/or revenue growthdo not meet our expectati
ons, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated paymentrequirements of certain agreements
. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, orreacting to changes in our bus
iness and the market segments in which we operate. If we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, oris unable to be shown in a terri
tory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our contentcommitments, we may not be 
able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.We are devoting more r
esources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies.We believe that original pro
gramming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To theextent our original progr
amming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand andresults of operations may b
e adversely impacted.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our opera
tions internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members andfeatures related 
to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As ourinternational offe
ring evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular thosedealing with e-commer
ce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developingtechnology and utilizing th
ird-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number ofdisciplines, including cr
eative, marketing, legal, finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able tomanage the growing complexi
ty of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streamingoperations and original con
tent, our business may be adversely affected.We could be subject to economic, politica
l, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.Operating in international
 markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risksthat may be differen
t from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that couldadversely affect our bus
iness, including:•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assetsbefore we have developed a fu
ll appreciation for its performance within a given territory;•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;•
management distraction;•
political or social unrest and economic instability;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corruptpayments to government off
icials;•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;•
regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatoryrequirements or otherwis
e, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;•
less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;•
adverse domestic or international tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such a
s value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application ofjudgment in determining ou
r global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate taxdetermination is uncertain;
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impactrevenues and expenses of our int
ernational operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;4

Table of Contents•
profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;•
differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;•
new and different sources of competition;•
censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service;•
low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;•
different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws;•
availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;•
integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and•
differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy.Our failure to manage any o
f these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets 
establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we maynot be able to attract or retain m
embers, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a posi
tive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choicesfrom which to obtain enter
tainment video. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwisenot compelling to consumers, ou
r ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing,customer service and pu
blic relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputationmay likewise be adversely 
impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful increating positive imp
ressions, our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted.Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our 
marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.We utilize a broad m
ix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to promote our service topotential new members. We
 may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we becomeconcerned that members or 
potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels arecurtailed, our ability to attract
 new members may be adversely affected.If companies that promo
te our service decide that we negatively impact their business, that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter asimilar business or decid
e to exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to such marketing channels. We also acquire a number ofmembers who rejoin our servi
ce having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarlyeffective sources, or 
if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affectedWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liabil
ity in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through ourservice.
As a distributor of content, we f
ace potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and contentof materials that we 
acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketingmaterials and fea
tures on our Web site such as member reviews. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs andother expenses, such as ongoing guild pay
ments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewalsrelated to entert
ainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. To the extent we donot accurately anti
cipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service, or if we become liable forcontent we acquire, produce, 
license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and5

Table of Contentsdamages arising from any 
liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of thesetypes and we may not have insuranc
e coverage for these types of claims.If studios, content providers or other rights holders r
efuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could beadversely affected.
Our ability to provide our me
mbers with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distributesuch content and certain 
related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and theterms and conditions of such l
icenses vary. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us contentupon terms acceptable 
to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Many of the licenses forcontent provide for the stud
ios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as otheractions we may take, conten
t available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programmingincrease. As we seek to diffe
rentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including originalcontent. We are also fo
cused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selectiveabout the titles we add and r
enew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adverselyaffected.
Music contained within conten
t we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collectionmanagement organiza
tions (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable toreach mutually acc
eptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, whichcould adversely impact ou
r business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in variousterritories could adv
ersely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, andthereby adversely impa
ct our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us topotential liability for copyri
ght infringement or otherwise increase our costs.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service avai
lable on their devices.We currently offer 
members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players,television set-top boxe
s and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service availablethrough the television set
-top boxes of these service providers. We intend to continue to bro aden our capability to instantly stream TV shows and movies to otherplatforms and partners ov
er time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, contentlicensing, regulatory or o
ther impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business could beadversely impacted. Our ag
reements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if,upon expiration, a number of our p
artners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms mayinclude the degree of a
ccessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while theseentities should be responsibl
e for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfactiontoward Netflix and such dissatis
faction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to ourstreaming functional
ity may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members'use and enjoyment could be nega
tively impacted.Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer syste
ms or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including thoserelating to cybersecurity or a
rising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including memberand corporate information, or theft of int
ellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.Our reputation and ability 
to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems andthose of third parties th
at we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, othernatural disasters, te
rrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general,could make our service unav
ailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errorsin our software or the unavai
lability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing andpotential members.

Table of ContentsOur computer systems and those of 
third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as computerviruses, denial of servic
e attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to leadto interruptions and delays 
in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member andcorporate informat
ion) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties weuse, if successful, could har
m our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwarthackers and protect our da
ta and systems. To date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers maynot be successful in the futu
re. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disruptingour service or otherwise a
ccessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offeringand systems. Any significant disrup
tion to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and resultsof operation.
We utilize our own communi
cations and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. Inaddition, we utilize thi
rd-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content deliverynetworks to help us stream TV shows and movies 
in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting,"cloud" computing, or other network p
roviders, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact theexperience of our members.
We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate cer
tain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon WebServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services ("AWS") provides 
a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a"cloud" computing service. W
e have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other servicesprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast m
ajority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operationsto another cloud provider, any d
isruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.While the retail s
ide of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantageagainst our service.
If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not opera
te to expectations, our business and results of operation could beadversely impacted.
We utilize a combin
ation of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed torecommend and merchand
ise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumerelectronic devices. For 
example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers ("ISPs") do notinterconnect with our CDN, or if we expe
rience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our memberscould be adversely impac
ted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandisingtechnology does n
ot enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected.We also utilize thi
rd party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technologyor that of third parti
es we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add newmembers may be impai
red. Also, any harm to our members' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverseeffect on our business, resul
ts of operations and financial condition.If government regulations relating to 
the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modificat
ion of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the mannerin which we currently conduct our bus
iness. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringentconsumer protection laws, which 
may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations ofexisting regulations or l
egislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.Changes in laws or regulations tha
t adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease thedemand for our service and 
increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws7

Table of Contentsintended to prevent net
work operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, includingthe United States and the Europe
an Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changinginterpretations, am
endments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experiencediscriminatory or ant
i-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across the
ir networks could adversely impact our business.We rely upon the ability o
f consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our serviceover their networks, our servi
ce and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, includingmeaningful bandwidth caps, or oth
erwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and ourmembership acquisition an
d retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and eithercharge us for or prohibit us f
rom being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.Most network operators that prov
ide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,many network operators have an 
incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe thatconsumer demand, regulato
ry oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferentialtreatment to thei
r data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. Insome international m
arkets, these same incentives apply however, the consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in ourdomestic market.
Privacy concerns could limit our abili
ty to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by ourmembers. We currently face certain le
gal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacygroups and governmental bodies fo
r attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users' browsing and otherhabits. Increased regul
ation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and usedata, could have an adverse 
effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, ourbusiness reputation could be adv
ersely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may becomesubject to additional and
/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding datalocalization and/or 
restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter ourbusiness model or practic
es to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membe
rship data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorizedpersons.
We maintain personal d
ata regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of thirdparties we use in our operat
ions. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to securesuch information. We tak
e measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing servicesor other third party serv
ices we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. In the event of such a breach, current andpotential members m
ay become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. Additionally, we could face legal claims orregulatory fines or pena
lties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of adata breach. For these re
asons, should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur, our business could be adversely affected.8

Table of ContentsWe are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our servi
ce using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets. We rely on internal syst
ems as well as those of third parties to process payment.  Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rulesand regulations and requir
e payment of interchange and other fees.  To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in paymentprocessing fees, mater
ial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processorsand/or changes to rules or r
egulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted.   Inaddition, from time to 
time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled andmanaged could create n
egative consumer perceptions of our service.If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate
ly protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brandand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affect
ed.We rely and expect to con
tinue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties withwhom we have relationships, as well 
as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforceour proprietary rights th
rough court proceedings. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, theseapplications may not be app
roved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly orunknowingly infringe our intell
ectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If theprotection of our intel
lectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assetsmay be diminished, compet
itors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service tomembers and potential members
 may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.We currently hold various do
main names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect ourreputation and brand and mak
e it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent thirdparties from acquir
ing domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.Intellectual property claims aga
inst us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, streamingtechnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, tit
le selection processes and marketing activities.Trademark, copyright, pat
ent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to ourtechnology, business processes and th
e content on our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing ourservice through contractual
 and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable toobtain sufficient righ
ts, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response toclaims against us for in
fringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position maybe adversely affect
ed. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. Thereare numerous patents tha
t broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology.Defending ourselves against in
tellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation anddiversion of technical 
and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation andmerchandising technology or 
inability to market our service or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringingtechnology, enter into roya
lty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, ifrequired, may be costly or un
available on terms acceptable to us.We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unfores
een expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention.
From time to time, we ar
e subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, wehave seen a rise in the numb
er of litigation matters against us. These matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions,each of which are typica
lly expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of ourmanagement's time and 
attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.9

Table of ContentsWe may seek additional capital that may result 
in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.From time to time, we may s
eek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capitalwill depend on, among other things, our bus
iness plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through theissuance of equity, equity-
linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and ourstockholders may experien
ce dilution.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obliga
tions, which could adversely affect our financialposition.
We have a substantial a
mount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.4 billionaggregate principal 
amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $6.5 billion of total content liabilities asreflected on our consolid
ated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, theamounts of which are signifi
cant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5,Commitments and Contingencies. Our subs
tantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our otherobligations;
•
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general businesspurposes;
•
require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;•
limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.We may not be able to generate suffici
ent cash to service our debt and other obligations.Our ability to make paymen
ts on our indebtedness, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance,which is subject to prevail
ing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable tomaintain a level of 
cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including theNotes, and other obligations, inc
luding amounts due under our streaming content obligations.If our cash flows and capita
l resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments andcapital expenditures, o
r to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes and obligations such as our streamingcontent obligations. These a
lternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. We cannotassure you that we would be able to i
mplement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. In the absence of such operating results and resources, wecould face substantial 
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We maynot be able to consummate 
those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debtservice obligations or oth
er obligations then due.If we are unable to servi
ce our debt obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. Ourability to refinanc
e or restructure our debt will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of ourdebt could be at higher int
erest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may notbe able to refinance 
any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire quali
fied employees.10

Table of ContentsWe rely on the continued se
rvice of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executiveteam and other key employ
ees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilledbusiness, product development, t
echnical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existingpersonnel, which may be disruptiv
e to our operations.If our Domestic DVD segment declines faster 
than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.The number of memberships to ou
r DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We believe, however, that thedomestic DVD business will continue to gen
erate significant contribution profit for our business. The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD businesswill help provide capita
l resources to fund our growth internationally. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than weanticipate, our business cou
ld be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operationswill not be meaningfully i
mproved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfactioncould be negatively impa
cted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.If the U.S. Postal Service were to in
crease postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processingfacilities or serv
ice reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit could beadversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that s
tockholders may consider favorable.Our charter documents may d
iscourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;•
provide for a classified board of directors;•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and•
prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.As a Delaware corporation, we ar
e also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in abusiness combination with any holde
r of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board ofdirectors has approved the 
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.In addition, a merger or 
acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated ExecutiveSeverance and Retention Inc
entive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common s
tock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including thefollowing, some of which are beyond our 
control:•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow;•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;•
market volatility in general;11

Table of Contents•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and•
the operating results of our competitors.As a result of these and other 
factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.Following certain peri
ods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more suchlitigation following futu
re periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Financial forecasting may differ 
materially from actual results.Given the dynamic nature of ou
r business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, contribution margins, net incomeand number of total and paid 
membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could causea decline in the trad
ing price of our common stock.

ear ended December 31, 2016 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in the average number of paid streaming 
memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on Netflixas a global internet TV network. Th
e impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per payingmembership resulting from 
price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streamingsegment. The increase in op
erating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue toacquire, license and produ
ce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion.Net income was further imp
acted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate, slightlyoffset by gains on foreign cur
rency denominated transactions. We intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017.We offer three types o
f streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our "basic" plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definitionquality streaming on a sing
le screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to highdefinition quality str
eaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-highdefinition quality cont
ent on four screens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S.dollar equivalent of app
roximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.We expect that from 
time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in May 2014, in the U.S., we increased theprice of our standard plan 
from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S.,we increased the price o
f this same standard plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In2016, we phased out grandfathered pr
icing, giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 per month, continuing on the standardstreaming plan at the h
igher price of $9.99 per month, or electing the premium plan at $11.99 per month.The following represents the k
ey elements to our segment results of operations:•
We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an importantmeasure of our operating s
egment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and otherexpenses associated with the 
licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights weregenerally obtained for ou
r current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With ourglobal expansion, we now aspire to obta
in global rights for our content. We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments basedon estimated fair m
arket value. Other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, includingthose we pay to our integrated p
ayment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues . We have built our own global contentdelivery network ("Open Connect") to h
elp us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming18

Table of Contentsdelivery expenses, there
fore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated withdelivering streaming 
content over the internet. Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses,including amortizat
ion of DVD content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customerservice centers. Deliv
ery expenses for the Domestic DVD segment consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our members and the packagingand label costs for the m
ailers.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our partnersincluding device partne
rs, MVPD's, mobile platforms and ISP's. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and televisionadvertising. Payments to our pa
rtners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic andInternational stre
aming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.Marketing expenses incurr
ed by our International streaming segment have been significant and fluctuate dependent upon the number of internationalterritories in which our
 streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories.•
We have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012to 36% in 
2016 . As a result of our focus on growing the st reaming segments, contribution margins for the Domestic and International streaming segmentsare lower than for our Domest
ic DVD segment.19

increase in our domestic stream ing revenues was due to a 12% growth in the average number o f paid memberships and an 8% increase inaverage monthly revenue p
er paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 15% comparedto the same quarter in p

icing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material. Our standard plan continues to be the mostpopular plan choice for new m
emberships.The 
increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $335.4 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and newstreaming content, inc

Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended De
cember 31, 2015The 
increase in our international r evenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number o f paid international memberships and a  4%  increase inaverage monthly revenue p
er paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 10% comparedto the same quarter in p
rior year. These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership were due to price changes and plan mix, offset partially byunfavorable fluctuat
ions in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174 million higher in the year endedDecember 31, 2016 if foreign ex
change rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015. If foreign currency exchange ratesfluctuate more than expected,
 revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations. Average paid international streamingmemberships accounted fo
r 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2016 , as compared to 35%  of total average paid streamingmemberships as of 
December 31, 2015 . The 
increase in international cost o f revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streamingcontent, including more ex
clusive and original programming. Other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses,costs associated with our custo
mer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resultingfrom exchange rate

International mark
eting expenses increased mainly due to expenses for t erritories launched in the last eighteen months.International contr

Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended De
cember 31, 2014The increase in our inte
rnational revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number o f paid international memberships offset partially by a  10%  decrease in average 
monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact ofexchange rate fluctu
ations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT rates across our European markets beginning January 1, 2015. Thesedecreases were parti
ally offset by our pricing changes and plan mix. We believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in2015 if foreign exchange ra
tes had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.The 
increase in international cost o f revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territorieslaunched in the last eigh

content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect tosignificantly incre
ase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negativefree cash flows even after
 we achieve material global profitability.We currently antic
ipate that cash flows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufficient to meetour cash needs for at leas
t the next twelve months. Our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, amongother things, our development 
efforts, business plans, operating performance, financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seekfinancing. We may not be ab
le to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linkedor debt securities, those s
ecurities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experiencedilution.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , cash and cash equivalents he ld by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $278.5 million. If these funds are needed for ouroperations in the U.S., we would be required 
to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributedearnings for certain 
foreign subsidiaries.Free Cash Flow
We define free cash 
flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturitiesand sales of short-term 
investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cashgenerated that is ava
ilable to repay debt obligations, make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, includinginvestments in global str
eaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation25

Table of Contentsof, or as a substitute for, ne
t income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance orliquidity presented in a
ccordance with GAAP.In assessing liquidity in re
lation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences areexcess content payments ove
r expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments overexpense is variable based on 
the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cashpayments, such as licensing and p
roduction of original content. In the last 12 months, the ratio of content payments over content expense was 1.4. Working capitaldifferences include d
eferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly anddeferred revenue is a sou
rce of cash flow.

For the purpose of this table, con
tractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding andthat specify all significant term
s, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timingof the transaction. The exp
ected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2016 
. Timing of payments and actu al amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts forsome obligations. The following t

As of December 31, 2016 , streaming content oblig ations were comprised of $3.6 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.9 billion of "Non- current content liab
ilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $8.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets asthey did not then meet
 the criteria for recognition.Streaming content obliga
tions increased $3.6 billion from $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to multi-year commi
tments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.Streaming content obliga
tions include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production ofcontent includes non-canc
elable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of contentis incurred at the time we
 enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. Certain agr
eements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yetdeterminable as of th
e reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where thenumber of seasons to be aired 
is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include anyestimated obligation 
for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknownobligations are expect
ed to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the paymentsfor the vast majority o
f such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgmentsand the actual amounts m
ay differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligationstable above.

Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $18.5 million related to our curren t Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemedowner for accounting purposes, com
mitments of $530.2 million for our expanded headquarte rs in Los Gatos, California, and our new office space in LosAngeles, California and other 
commitments of $92.1 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varyingthrough approximately 2027.

Other purchase obligati ons include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, DVDcontent acquisition, and m
iscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had gross unrecognized tax bene fits of $19.7 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction todeferred tax assets which was 
classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonablypossible adjustments to the b
alance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions wi
th unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we havefinancial guarantees, sub
ordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks,contingent liabilit
ies, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risksupport to us.

The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof the financial sta
tements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") hasdefined a company’s cri
tical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,and which require a company to 
make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We bas
e our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual result
s may differ from these estimates.Streaming Content
We acquire, license 
and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The contentlicenses are for a f
ixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cashpayments relative to the amortizati
on expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classifiedwithin "Net cash used in (provided by) op
erating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses we capitali
ze the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost ofthe title is known and the ti
tle is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,net” and the remaining po
rtion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, we capitaliz
e costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in "Non-currentcontent assets, net" on the Consolid
ated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on theConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month offirst availabili
ty. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For content where we expect more upfront viewing, for instance due toadditional merchandis
ing and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors that impact the28

Table of Contentsamortization of the 
content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment. In the third quarter of 2016,we changed the amortiza
tion method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a$19.8 million decrease in op
erating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effect on both basic and dilutedearnings per share was a dec
rease of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results ofoperations.
Our business model is subscription bas
ed as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed andproduced, are reviewed in agg
regate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness or thatthe fair value may be 
less than amortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in thefuture, these aggregat
ed content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assetsthat have been, or are exp
ected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented.Income Taxes
We record a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Deferred income taxes are reco
gnized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carryingamounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assetsand liabilities of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, ifnecessary, by a valuation a
llowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no significant valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 
or 2015 . Although we believe our assumptions, judg
ments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of anytax audits could signific
antly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our abili
ty to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our pastoperating results, and our fo
recast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized indetermining future t
axable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.Actual operating results 
in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not thatsubstantially all def
erred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would notbe able to realize 
all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in whichwe make such determinat
ion.We did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it ismore likely than not the 
tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefitsrecognized in the finan
cial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realizedupon settlement. At 
December 31, 2016 , our estimated gross unrecogn ized tax benefits were $19.7 million of which $17.0 million, if recognized, would favorablyimpact our future ea
rnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may changeand the actual tax benefits
 may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding incometaxes.
Stock-Based Compensation
We grant fully vested non-qu
alified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expenseis fully recognized on the g
rant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based onthe total number of options g
ranted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.•
Expected Volatility: The Company calculates  expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. We believe that implied volatility of publicly tradedoptions in our common stock is mor
e reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably beexpected to be a bette
r indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An increase/decrease of 10% in our computation ofexpected volatility would 
increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $14.4 million for the year endedDecember 31, 2016 
. 29

Table of Contents•
Suboptimal Exercise Factor:  Our computation of the suboptim al exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. Anincrease/decreas
e in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $6.0million for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Ma rket RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreigncurrency fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective of 
our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments withoutsignificantly incre
ased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposureto interest rate and 
credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to variousasset classes. We maintain a
 portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-saleand are recorded at f
air value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
For the year ended 
December 31, 2016 , we had no impairment charg es associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our currentinvestment portfolio has
 very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance thatour investment portfolio wi
ll remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interestrates which may cause the p
rincipal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the pre
vailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2016 , our cash equivalents were gen erallyinvested in money market 
funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments were 
comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset backed securities.Changes in interest rate
s could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as short-term investments. The table belowseparates these invest
ments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of December 31, 2016 .

Table of Contents Based on investment positions as of 
December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.9million incremental decline in the
 fair market value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 , a similar 100 basis point in crease in the yield curve would haveresulted in a $6.6 million 
incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investmentsprior to maturity.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had $3.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed r ate unsecured debt in five tranches. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financialstatements for deta
ils about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates ofinterest and declining 
in periods of increasing rates of interest.Foreign Currency Risk
International revenu
es and cost of revenues account for 36% and 48% , respectively, of consolid ated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The majority of interna
tional revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreigncurrency risk relat
ed to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real.Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue andcontribution profit (loss
) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , we believe our internat ionalrevenues would have been approxim
ately $174.4 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year endedDecember 31, 2015 
. We have also experienc
ed and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurementof monetary assets and li
abilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recognized a $22.8 million foreign exchange 
gain which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functionalcurrencies.
We do not use foreign exchange 
contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factorsthat we cannot forecast wi
th reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result suchfluctuations could have a s
ignificant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.

Controls and Procedures (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the par
ticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evalua
tion, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls andprocedures as of the end of th
e period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required tobe disclosed by us in reports tha
t we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reportedwithin the time periods spe
cified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated toour management, including ou
r Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chi
ef Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or ourinternal controls will p
revent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the obje
ctives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must b
e considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.31

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2016 
. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessm ent under the framework in Internal Control— Integrated Framework 
(2013 framework), our manage ment concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 . The effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independ ent registeredpublic accounting firm,

lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, 
Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a

income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 . These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”
) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internettelevision network with over 
93 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,including original seri
es, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen.Members can play, pause and r
esume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), members can receive DVDs.The Company has 
three reportable segments, Domes tic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues aregenerated in the United Sta
tes, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derivedfrom monthly membership 
fees.Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe financial stat
ements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates andassumptions include t
he amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and thevaluation of stock-based co
mpensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes tobe reasonable under the
 circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
which amended the existing a ccounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenueupon the transfer of promis
ed goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods orservices. In July 2015, the FASB deferred th
e effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periodswithin those periods). Early adop
tion is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interimreporting periods within those p
eriods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period (full retrospective) or retrospectively with thecumulative effec
t recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective). The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 andapply the full retrospe
ctive approach. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase t ransparency and comparability among organizations byrecognizing lease asse
ts and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that alessee should recognize a 
liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the leaseterm on the balance she
et. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using amodified retrospect
ive approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and is currently in the processof evaluating the impa
ct of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment A ccounting , which amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718,  
Compensation – Stock Compensation .  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspe cts of the accounting for share-based paymenttransactions, including th
e income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU2016-09 is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 inthe first quarter of 2017. Th
e Company is unable to estimate the impact of adoption as it is dependent45

Table of Contentsupon future stock option exerc
ises which can not be predicted. However, the Company is expecting the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on netincome, basic and diluted 
earnings per share, deferred tax assets and net cash from operations and the effective tax rate may be reduced.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash , which requires amounts gener ally described as restricted cash and restricted cashequivalents be included with 
cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cashflows. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fis
cal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a retrospective transitionmethod to each period pres
ented. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers investments 
in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company alsoclassifies amounts in tran
sit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.The Company classifies short-
term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.Short-term investments 
are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equityin the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to beother-than-temporary on availa
ble-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. TheCompany uses the specific iden
tification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.Short-term investments 
are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Companyreviews factors such as the 
length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent tosell, or whether it would be mor
e likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.Streaming Content
The Company acquires, licenses 
and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.The content licenses ar
e for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require moreupfront cash payments rel
ative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, areclassified within "Net cash 
(used in) provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, the Company capit
alizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,the cost of the title 
is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Currentcontent assets, net” and th
e remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, the Company capita
lizes costs associated with the production, including development costs and direct costs. These amounts are included in"Non-current content assets, n
et" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”on the Consolidated Statements o
f Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with themonth of first availability.
 The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For content where the Company expects more upfront viewing,for instance due to addit
ional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on an accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting theamortization of the 
content assets on a regular basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.  In the thirdquarter of 2016, the Company changed 
the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of thischange in estimate was a 
$19.8 million decrease in operating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net incom e for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effecton both basic earnings per shar
e and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.03 for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2016. Changes in estimates could have asignificant impact on 
the Company's future results of operations.The Company's business model is subscript
ion based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, bothlicensed and produced are 
reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expectedusefulness of the content or 
that the fair value may be less than amortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If suchchanges are identified in t
he future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In46

ts for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost wasrecorded in any of the per
iods presented.The Company has entered into ce
rtain licenses with collective management organizations, and are currently involved in negotiations with others who holdcertain rights to musi
c and other entertainment works "publicly performed" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for estimatedlicense fees are r
ecorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The results ofthese negotiations are u
ncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.DVD Content
The Company acquires DVD content for the pu
rpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, assuch, the Company considers its dir
ect purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current contentassets, net” on the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within "Net cash providedby (used in) investing activ
ities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Othercompanies in the in-home 
entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on anaccelerated basis ov
er their estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharingagreements with studios and oth
er content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of theestimated useful liv
es of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term fo r leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings arecapitalized and inc
luded in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized r
atably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members andremitted to governmental auth
orities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid membershipsthat have not been redee
med.Marketing
Marketing expenses consist pr
imarily of advertising expenses and payments made to the Company’s partners, including device partners, MVPD's, mobileplatforms and ISP's. Advertising expens
es include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising expenses were 
$842.4 million , $714.3 million and $533.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Research and Development
Research and development exp
enses are included within "Technology and Development" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations andprimarily consist of pay
roll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $768.3 million , $570.0 million 
and $398.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Income Taxes
The Company records a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liabilitymethod. Deferred income ta
xes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of exist
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferredtax assets and liabili
ties of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets isreduced, if necessary, by a v
aluation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no significant valuation allowance as ofDecember 31, 2016 or 2015.
The Company did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a taxbenefit only if it is mo
re likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recogni
zed in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon

cognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated finan cialstatements for further informatio
n regarding income taxes.Foreign Currency
The functional currency 
for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. TheCompany translates the asse
ts and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end ofeach period. Revenues and expenses 
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from thesetranslations are re
cognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.
Prior to January 1, 2015, the function
al currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functionalcurrency of these enti
ties to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service inseveral significant Eu
ropean countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities havebeen remeasured to the eur
o at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective forthe period in which the balan
ce arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative transla tion adjustmentincluded in other compreh
ensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.The Company remeasure
s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of eachperiod. Gains and losses from thes
e remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of$22.8 million 
for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2016 and losses of $37.3 million and $8.2 million for the years ended Decemb er 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Earnings Per Share
In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors d
eclared a seven -for-one stock split in th e form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to allshareholders of record as o
f July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split").Outstanding share and per-shar
e amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Basic earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings pershare is computed using the weigh
ted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during theperiod. Potential common sha
res consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is asfollows:

Short-term Investments The Company’s investment policy 
is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principallyfor the purpose of selling th
em in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to time, theCompany may sell certain s
ecurities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize, bymajor security type, th
e Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy and where they areclassified on the Consolidat

ue of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readilyand regularly availab
le in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such asquoted prices for similar a

re obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporateavailable trade, bid

Streaming content obliga
tions include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. Obligations that are in non-U.S.dollar currencies a
re translated to U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creativetalent and employment 
agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement toobtain future titles. Onc
e a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include theobligation to license r
ights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional filmoutput deals, like the U.S. output dea
l with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples ofsuch license agreemen
ts. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, theunknown obligations are expected 
to be significant.Lease obligations
The Company leases facili
ties under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027. Several lease agreements contain rentescalation clauses or 
rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company usesthe date of initial poss
ession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation forintended use. For scheduled rent 
escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, theCompany records minimum ren
tal expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company hasthe option to extend or renew mos
t of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.Because the terms of the Comp
any’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvementin the construction funding of 
the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Companyrecorded an asset of 
$40.7 million , representing the tota l costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of thebuildings), with corresponding li
abilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building 
assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December 31, 2016 , the lease financing obligation balance was 
$29.2 million , the majority of which is r ecorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remainingfuture minimum paymen
ts under the lease financing obligation are $18.5 million . The lease financing oblig ation balance at the end of the lease term will beapproximately 
$21.8 million which approximates the net book v alue of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.In addition to the lease 
financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $530.2 million as of December 31, 2016 related to non-cancelable operating leases for th
e expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the new office space in Los Angeles, California.52

From time to time, in th
e normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employeerelations, business pract
ices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complexlegal proceedings are d
ifficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. TheCompany expenses legal fees as 
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be re
asonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operationsor its financial posit
ion, liquidity or results of operations.The Company is involved in litiga
tion matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at thistime. The Company's view of the ma
tters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.6.
Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varyingscope and terms to business par
tners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach ofsuch agreements and o
ut of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other partymaking a claim pursuant t
o the procedures specified in the particular contract.The Company’s obligations under thes
e agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourseagainst third parties 
for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers thatwill require it, among oth
er things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The termsof such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to theconditional nature of th
e Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in theaccompanying financial statement
s with respect to these indemnification guarantees.7.

ct on provision (in thousands) 65,173  47,125  43,999 The Company considers several f
actors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior and theemployee groupings. Prior to Janua
ry 1, 2015, the Company bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determinethe suboptimal exercis
e factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimalexercise factor as 
the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted.Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company's comput
ation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and impliedvolatility of tradab
le forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade volume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precludedsole reliance on impl
ied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that impliedvolatility of publicly 
traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, canreasonably be expected to b
e a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.In valuing shares issued under th
e Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-couponissues with terms simila
r to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and thereforeuses an expected dividend yie
ld of  zero  in the option valuation mode l. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upongrant date.

are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 . In evaluating its abili
ty to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating resultsand the forecast of futu
re market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2016 and 
2015 , it was considered more lik ely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets would be realized, and no significant valuation allowance was recorded.As of 
December 31, 2016 , the Company's Federal R&D tax credi t and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $72.5 million , and $77.7 million 
, respectively. The Federa l R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2036. State tax credit carryforwards of $77.3 million can be carried forward indefinitely and

December 31, 2016 , the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards for Federal and state tax return purposes were $108.9 million and $100.0 million, respectively, which expir
e in 2035. These net operating losses were generated as a result of excess stock option deductions. Pursuant to Accounting StandardsCodification 718, 
Compensation - Stock Compensation , the Company has not recognized th e related $45.1 million tax benefit from the Fed eral and state netoperating losses attribu
table to excess stock option deductions in gross deferred tax assets. The $45.1 million tax benefit will be credited  directly to additional paid-in capital when net opera
ting losses attributable to excess stock option deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable.Income tax benefits attributable
 to the exercise of employee stock options of $64.3 million , $79.9 million and $88.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 
, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were recor ded directly to additional paid-in-capital.The unrecognized tax

Table of ContentsThe Company includes interest 
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities”in the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.The Company files U.S. Federal, state 
and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2014 and 2015. Theyears 2010 through 2015 remain subje
ct to examination by the state of California. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years2012 through 2015 remain subject to 
examination by foreign jurisdictions.Given the potential outcom
e of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute oflimitations, it is r
easonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimateof the range of reasonably poss
ible adjustments cannot be made.10.
Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) sav
ings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual salary through payroll deduc
tions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at thediscretion of the Board. During 
2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company’s matching contr ibutions totaled $15.7 million , $11.2 million and $8.3 million , respectively. 11.
Segment Information The Company has 
three reportable segments: Dom estic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in thesame manner that the Comp
any’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. TheCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribut
ion profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost ofrevenues and marketing exp
enses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportablesegment because these o
perating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.The Domestic streaming seg
ment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in theUnited States. The Internat
ional streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content tomembers outside of the Unit
ed States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the rel
ated payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)and the geographic region f
rom which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.The vast majority of the 
cost of revenues relate to content expenses, which include the amortization of streaming content assets and other costs associatedwith the licensing and acquis
ition of streaming content. In connection with the Company's global expansion, content acquired, licensed, and produced increasinglyincludes global rights. The Company 
allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming segments based on estimated fair market value.Content expenses for each str
eaming segment thus includes both expenses directly incurred by the segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for globalrights. Other costs of revenues su
ch as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment.Marketing expenses consist pr
imarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our device partners, MVPD's, mobile platforms and ISP's which are generallyincluded in the segment in whi
ch the expenditures are directly incurred.The Company's long-lived tangible 
assets were located as follows:

A membership (also refe rred to as a subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method ofpayment being provided. Membe
rships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internalsystems, which utilize indust
ry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total membersinclude those who are on a fre
e-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the abovemetrics as of the effective cancellatio
n date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntarycancellation of the service, a
s a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short graceperiod is offered to ensur
e the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integratedpayment partners. The numbe
