Item 2.05    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On January 4, 2023, Salesforce, Inc. (the “Company”) announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating
margins, and continue advancing the Company’s ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of the Company’s current workforce
by approximately 10 percent and select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets. Decisions regarding the elimination of positions are
subject to local law and consultation requirements in certain countries, as well as the Company’s business needs.
The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges in connection with the Plan, of which approximately $800
million to $1.0 billion is expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. These charges consist primarily of $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion in charges
related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and share-based compensation; and $450 million to $650 million in exit charges
associated with the office space reductions. Of the aggregate amount of charges that the Company estimates it will incur in connection with the Plan, the
Company expects that approximately $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion will be in future cash expenditures.
The actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the Company’s fiscal 2024,
subject to local law and consultation requirements. The actions associated with the real estate restructuring under the Plan are expected to be fully complete in
fiscal 2026.
The estimates of the charges and expenditures that the Company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of
assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates.
In addition, the Company may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in
connection with the implementation of the Plan.
A letter to the Company’s employees from Marc Benioff, the Company’s Chair and Co-Chief Executive Officer, regarding the employee restructuring under the
Plan is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
Letter  to Employees
Date:  January 4, 2023
Subject: Important Company Update
As one ‘Ohana, over the last 23 years, Salesforce has built the #1 CRM that drives incredible customer success across every line of
business for every industry around the world. We have never been more mission-critical to our customers. We have an unparalleled
ecosystem, with thousands of partners and millions of Trailblazers building their companies on our platform.
However , the environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing
decisions. With this in mind, we’ve made the very dif ficult decision to reduce our workforce by about 10 percent, mostly over the
coming weeks.
I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment. As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many
people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.
Within the next hour , employees who are initially af fected by this decision will receive an email letting them know . Our leadership
will reach out directly to these employees, and provide clarity for their teams about changes within their or ganizations.
For those who will be leaving Salesforce, our priority is to fully support them, including by of fering a generous package. In the U.S.,
affected employees will receive a minimum of nearly five months of pay , health insurance, career resources, and other benefits to
help with their transition. Those outside the U.S. will receive a similar level of support, and our local processes will align with
employment laws in each country .
The employees being af fected aren’ t just colleagues. They’re friends. They’re family . Please reach out to them. Of fer the compassion
and love they and their families deserve and need now more than ever . And most of all, please lean on your leadership, including me,
as we work through this dif ficult time together .
I’m grateful for every single one of you who has contributed to our continued success as a company , and the hard work and
sacrifices you have made to generate success for our hundreds of thousands of customers. You’ve built our company — for all of our
stakeholders — and you’ve shown incredible resilience every step of the way .
With gratitude,      
Marc
