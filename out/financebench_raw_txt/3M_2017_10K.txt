Distribution
 
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers,
jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with
skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.
 
Research and Patents
 
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit
growth. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.850 billion in 2017, $1.735 billion in 2016 and $1.763 billion in 2015.
Research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $1.335 billion in 2017, $1.225 billion in 2016 and $1.223 billion in 2015. Related expenses
primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and
maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses
associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.
 
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous
U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by
new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent
grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,
which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in
the country.
 
The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or
group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
 
Raw Materials
 
In 2017, the Company continued to manage year-on-year raw material input costs, benefiting from input management, reformulations, and
multi-sourcing activities. These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material categories in oil-derivative chemical
feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals,
metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably
foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have.
3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic
7
 
Table of Contents
 
relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks
through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
 
Environmental Law Compliance
 
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to
continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to
environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 15, Commitments and
Contingencies).
 
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and
reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or
approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
 
In 2017, 3M expended about $33 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for
remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are
expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant
improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed
or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital
expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $66 million over the next two years
for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
 
While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for
environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may
also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to
shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.
Words such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,”
“forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include,
among others, statements relating to:
·
the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial
performance, and market position,
·
worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial
conditions of our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the
Company or our suppliers and customers,
·
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,
·
the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
·
the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
·
future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
·
future availability of and access to credit markets,
·
pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,
·
asset impairments,
·
tax liabilities,
·
information technology security, and
·
the effects of changes in tax (including the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), environmental and other laws and regulations
in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking
statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among
others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,”
“Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by
reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors
that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.
 
Item 1A. 
Risk Factor
 
s.
 
Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion
of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
 
* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.
 The Company
operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s
business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of
either contained or widespread recessionary
10
 
Table of Contents
 
conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity
measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in
specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and
suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate
earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
 
* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
 The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of
capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based
on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and
timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit
rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and
facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings
in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely
affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
 
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
 Demand for the Company’s products, which
impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the
Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of
inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in
the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our
products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the
demand for some of the Company’s products.
 
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its
sales and earnings. 
Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the
Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected
growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
 
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its
ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
 This ability may be adversely affected by
difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property
protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
 
* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials
and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency
exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.
 The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy
(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its
supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained
interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the
Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able
to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
 
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving
business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. 
The Company monitors its business portfolio and
organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its
organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions,
11
 
Table of Contents
 
future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.
 The Company
utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined
as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational
efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-
year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the
projected productivity improvements will be realized.
 
* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP
system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the
Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the
Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s
business and reputation. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of
which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business
processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may
have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and
customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and
systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may
still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages,
computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other
catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years.
While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to the Company’s information technology networks
and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the
Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings,
liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the
Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that
all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
 
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our
results.
 The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.
Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant
legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely
impact its results of operations and cash flows.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those
involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,
anti-corruption, or other matters.
 The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the
outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the
Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant
regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future
charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. For a more
detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 15
“Commitments and Contingencies” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year 2017 and fourth quarter EPS:
 
For the fourth quarter of 2017, net income attributable to 3M was $523 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $1.155 billion, or
$1.88 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 54.8 percent on a per diluted share.

Table of Contents
 
Excluding the $762 million impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), net income was $1.285 billion, or $2.10
per diluted share, an increase of 11.7 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net
income attributable to 3M was $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share, compared to $5.050 billion, or $8.16 per diluted share, for the full
year 2016, a decrease of 2.8 percent on a per diluted share basis. Excluding the 2017 impact related to TCJA, net income was $5.620 billion,
or $9.17 per diluted share, an increase of 12.4 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to 2016. The Company refers to various
measures excluding the 2017 net impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These non-GAAP measures are further described and
reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.
 
Organic growth/productivity in 2017 includes benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing
cost reduction projects, and business transformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. These benefits were
partially offset by higher defined benefit pension expenses. During both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, organic growth and
productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year benefit.
 
Acquisitions and divestitures decreased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017, while increasing
earnings per diluted share by 54 cents year-on-year for the full year 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve
months post-transaction, relate primarily to the acquisition of Scott Safety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety
includes income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to
financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents
per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining
portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business and cathode battery technology out-license
business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), identity management business and tolling and
automated license/number plate recognition business (both in the second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter
2017). The incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during the fourth quarter of 2017
was $26 million, or approximately 5 cents per diluted share. For the full year 2017, the year-on-year net pre-tax increase from divestitures
was approximately $474 million, which is equivalent to a year-on-year increase of 61 cents per diluted share (primarily related to the
identity management business). Additional discussion on divestitures is provided later within the “Divestitures and Strategic Investments”
section.
 
Operating income results include year-on-year incremental strategic investments that decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $51
million and $413 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. These incremental strategic investments are comprised of
3M’s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint. Additional discussion on strategic
investments is provided later within the “Divestitures and Strategic Investments” section.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company’s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased
its accruals. This incremental increase resulted in a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Refer to Note 15 for more details.
 
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $3 million and $111 million year-on-year in the
fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This had a minimal impact
per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year
2017.
 
Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 declined 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent year-on-year,
respectively, which benefited earnings per share. The Company purchased $504 million and $2.1 billion of its own stock in the fourth
quarter and full year 2017, respectively.
 
Other net interest decreased earnings per share for both fourth quarter and full year 2017, largely due to the loss on extinguishment of debt,
higher U.S. average balances, and higher interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a charge of $96 million, which
contributed to a year-on-year decrease of 11 cents per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Additionally, the portion
of interest expense related to the financing costs of

acquiring Scott Safety, which was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 2 cents per diluted share, is included in the acquisitions and
divestitures impact described above.
 
As discussed in the section below, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA, which
was equivalent to a decrease of $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2017 was
68.6 percent, an increase of 40.4 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 23.0
percent in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.2 percentage points versus 2016. For the full year 2017, the effective tax rate was 35.5
percent, an increase of 7.2 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in
the full year 2017, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the fourth quarter and full year 2017
change in tax rate was driven largely by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, favorable geographic mix and other
items, as referenced in Note 9.
 
Income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -  (non-GAAP measures):
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net
of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This
provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the
TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. See additional information in Note 9. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item
represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all
measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with,
nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the
Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a
useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies.

Year 2016 EPS:
 
For total year 2016, productivity and other increased earnings, helped by lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expenses, higher
selling prices, lower raw material costs, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These benefits were
partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset utilization.
 
Acquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of
Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016),
the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter
2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-
licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to
earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for
further discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts.
 
Restructuring actions (included within incremental strategic investments in the preceding table) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents
per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016.
 
Foreign exchange impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the
impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016.
 
Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding  in 2016 declined 3 percent versus 2015, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from
share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number of
diluted shares in 2016.
 
Higher average debt balances led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016.
 
The income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by
a number of factors as referenced in Note 9, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09
(discussed in Note 1).

From a business segment perspective, 3M achieved both total sales growth and organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic
volume and selling price impacts) in all five business segments. Operating income margins were 22.8 percent, with four of five business
segments above 22 percent.
 
·
In Industrial, total sales increased 6.9 percent, or 3.9 percent on an organic local currency basis, with organic sales growth in
abrasives, automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, and separation and
purification. Organic sales declined in advanced materials. Operating income margins were 19.4 percent, down 2.5 percentage
points, with the decline driven by incremental strategic investments and a fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of the temporary
protective films business.
·
In Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 15.0 percent, or 10.7 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales grew
in all businesses, led by personal safety, roofing granules, and transportation safety. Operating income margins were 26.3
percent, up 6.1 percentage points, with 2.4 percentage points of this increase driven by divestitures, partially offset by
acquisitions and incremental strategic investments.
·
In Health Care, total sales increased 6.0 percent, or 3.1 percent on an organic local currency sales basis. Organic sales grew in
food safety, health information systems, medical consumables, and oral care. Organic sales declined in drug delivery systems.
Operating income margins were 31.5 percent, up 1.8 percentage points.
·
In Electronics and Energy, total sales increased 12.5 percent, or 11.0 percent on an organic local currency basis. Electronics-
related organic sales increased 14 percent, with growth in both electronics materials solutions and display materials and systems.
Energy-related organic sales increased 4 percent as growth in electrical markets was partially offset by declines in
telecommunications markets. Operating income margins were 25.2 percent, down 2.5 percentage points. The fourth quarter 2016
gain on sale of intellectual property and fourth quarter 2017 incremental strategic investments negatively impacted operating
income margins by 3.3 percentage points.

Sales totaled $30.1 billion, a decrease of 0.5 percent from 2015. Organic local-currency sales declined 0.1 percent, with organic volume
declines of 0.8 percent largely offset by selling price increases of 0.7 percent. Acquisitions added 1.2 percent to sales, while divestitures
reduced sales by 0.4 percent. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.2 percent year-on-year.
 
Total sales increased 1.2 percent in the United States, and declined 1.1 percent in EMEA, 2.1 percent in Asia Pacific, and 2.7 percent in
Latin America/Canada. Organic local-currency sales grew 3.7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.5 percent in the United States, 0.4 percent
in EMEA, and declined 2.8 percent in Asia Pacific.
 
Financial condition:
 
3M generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, a decrease of $422 million when compared to 2016. This followed an increase
of  $242 million when comparing 2016 to 2015. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a
discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s
outstanding common stock. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock,
compared to purchases of $3.8 billion in 2016 and $5.2 billion in 2015. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion of its
own stock in 2018. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16
percent. This marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating,
25
 
Table of Contents
 
with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. The
Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.
 
Raw materials:
 
In 2017, the Company continued to manage year-on-year raw material input costs, benefiting from input management, reformulations, and
multi-sourcing activities. These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material categories in oil-derivative chemical
feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals,
metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably
foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have.
3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic
relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks
through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
 
Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
 
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension
plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 94 percent funded and the international pension plans
were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2017
for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 12.4%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets
to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for
2018 is 7.25%, consistent with 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2017 discount rate was 3.68%, down 0.53
percentage points from the year-end 2016 discount rate of 4.21%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of
the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status increased 4 percentage points in 2017 as
strong plan assets returns and $800 million in contributions increased asset values in excess of the higher PBO due to the significant discount
rate decline. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 12 (Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Plans).
 
3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
in 2018. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018. 3M expects
global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2018 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other)
to increase by approximately $76 million pre-tax when compared to 2017. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and
Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.
 
Divestitures and strategic investments:
 
In both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, the Company continued to accelerate investments in growth initiatives and footprint
optimization. In addition, the Company divested certain businesses as it continued to focus its portfolio on opportunities that create greater
value for its shareholders. As shown below, these divestitures and strategic investments led to a net year-on-year decrease of approximately
$0.01 per diluted share and a benefit of $0.10 per diluted share, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:

2017 announced and 2018 closed divestitures:
 
In December 2017, 3M announced it had reached an agreement to sell substantially all of its Communications Markets Division, which
consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions, structured cabling solutions, and telecommunications system integration
services. The business has annual global sales of approximately $400 million. The Company expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $500
million in 2018 as a result of this divestiture. 3M expects to realize a gain of approximately $0.40 per diluted share from this transaction, net
of actions related to this divestiture. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion.
 
In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat
stress monitoring. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of less
than $20 million that will be reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion.

Operating income margins increased in 2017 versus 2016, driven by gains from sale of businesses, partially offset by cost of sales increases.
A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, strategic investments,
divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income
statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general
and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M’s defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense increased $82 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of $305 million in 2016. Refer to Note 12 (Pension and
Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost.
 
The Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external
service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing
3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.
 
In 2017, as referenced above in the “Divestitures and strategic investments” section, 3M incurred $413 million in incremental strategic
actions, primarily reported within the cost of sales and SG&A income statement line items.
 
Of these strategic investments, 3M incurred $96 million (net of adjustments) in restructuring actions and $47 million in exit activities during
2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M incurred $114 million in restructuring charges. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the impact to operating expenses.
 
Cost of Sales:
 
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
 
Cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and
footprint optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset
by a year-on-year reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year
for the full year 2017.
 
Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased in 2016 due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as
selling prices increased net sales by 0.7 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In
addition, cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement costs. Fourth quarter 2015
restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.
28
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
 
SG&A increased $350 million year-on year, or 5.6 percent, during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments and higher defined benefit
pension expense. SG&A decreased $7 million, or 0.1 percent, in 2016 when compared to 2015, with 2016 results benefiting from foreign
currency translation, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. In addition, SG&A in 2016 benefited from
lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year
comparison.
 
Research, Development and Related Expenses:
 
R&D increased $115 million year-on-year and decreased $28 million year-on-year in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M continued to invest in
its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt
existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2017, 2016, and 2015.
 
Gain on Sale of Businesses:
 
In 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable, of its
identity management business, sold its tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and electronic monitoring businesses, and
sold the assets of its electrical marking/labeling business. On a combined basis, these divestitures resulted in a gain on the sale of businesses
of $586 million. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2016 and 2015, resulting in gains of $111 million and $47 million, respectively.
Refer to Note 2 for additional detail on these divestitures.
 
Operating Income Margin:
 
3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a
reconciliation of operating income margins for 2017 and 2016.

Year 2017 and fourth quarter operating income:
 
Operating income margins increased 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 0.7 percentage points for the full year
2017 when compared to the same periods last year. 3M benefited from higher organic local-currency sales growth and productivity, partially
offset by actuarial adjustments to the Company’s respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. Acquisitions and divestitures consist of the
transactions and integration costs, net of income, that relate to the acquisition of Scott Safety, in addition to the year-on-year divestiture
gains (refer to Note 2) and non-repeating operating losses from divested businesses, which combined, reduced operating margins in the
fourth quarter of 2017 and benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017. Items that reduced operating margins were
incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges related to 3M’s optimization of its
portfolio and supply chain footprint. For full year 2017, the benefit from year-on-year divestiture gains and non-repeating net operating
losses from divested businesses (primarily related to the sale of Identity
29
 
Table of Contents
 
Management) was partially offset by the impact of the Scott Safety acquisition noted earlier. 3M also benefited from raw material sourcing
cost reduction projects. Lastly, operating margins were reduced by foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher year-on-year
defined benefit pension expense. 
 
Year 2016 operating income:
 
Operating income margins were 24.0 percent in 2016 compared to 22.9 percent in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. 3M benefited
from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, plus lower year-on-year defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense. Acquisitions and divestitures had a favorable impact on operating margins. This included solid performances from
both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Divestiture impacts relate to the Polyfoam business, the library systems business, and
the license plate converting business in France. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business
and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic
investments, as 3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses.
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume, productivity, and other decreased
operating margins as a result of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and Energy businesses. Also, 3M had an
unfavorable arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and
accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. These declines within organic volume, productivity, and other were partially offset by 2015
restructuring charges, which provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, and productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015
restructuring actions.
 
Other Expense (Income), Net:
 
See Note 5 for a detailed breakout of this line item.
 
Interest expense increased during 2017 and 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. In addition, in
October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. The Company
recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included within interest expense.
Capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.
Capitalized interest was $12 million, $10 million, and $13 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Interest income increased year-on-year in both 2017 and 2016 due to higher average interest rates.

The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. The effective tax
rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between
years were impacted by many factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described
in the Overview, “
Income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP
measures)” 
section and in Note 9. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the
enactment of the TCJA. The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and
certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the
December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.
 
The TCJA establishes new tax laws that will also affect 2018 and future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S.
federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), 3) the creation of a new
provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 4) a
30
 
Table of Contents
 
general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to
reduce the U.S. income tax liability, 6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 7) the repeal of the domestic
production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA and other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate
for 2018 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of
income tax audits, changes in tax laws, measurement period adjustment effects on the provisional items and remaining analyses to complete
noted in Note 9 related to the 2017 impact of the TCJA, employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the
geographic mix of income before taxes.
 
Refer to Note 9 for further discussion of income taxes.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests
in 3M consolidated entities. The amount primarily relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.
 
Currency Effects:
 
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $111 million and $127 million in
2017 and 2016, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of
currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses,
including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and
other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities. 
 
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG
 
MENT
 
For a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M’s business segments, see Item 1, Business Segments.
Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter
of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the
following changes:
 
Integration of former Renewable Energy Division
·
3M’s former Renewable Energy Division (RED) has been integrated into existing divisions within the Electronics and Energy
business segment and Safety and Graphics business segment. 3M is committed to leadership in sustainability and to enabling the
advancement of energy solutions into the future. Integrating RED’s offerings into larger divisions already serving these segments
will provide increased scale and build on strength by leveraging 3M’s existing brands, go-to-market capabilities, and relationships
to support growth objectives.
 
Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division
·
3M created the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division, which combined the former Automotive Division and Aerospace
and Commercial Transportation Division, which were both within the Industrial business segment. Combining the strengths along
with the deep industry knowledge of each business will enable this new division to utilize shared technology platforms and
processes to deliver a broader set of innovative solutions, along with world-class quality and service to 3M’s customers. This
combination will help accelerate the Company’s profitable growth and market relevance across the automotive, aerospace and
commercial transportation industries.
 
31

Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting
·
The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts. This improved alignment
reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple businesses within 3M, creating a better customer
experience. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related
operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a
particular product sold in the U.S. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts changed the
attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments.
 
Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in
five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.
 
Corporate and Unallocated:
 
In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the
preceding business segments table and in Note 17. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate
investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and
environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation)
that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous
items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $80 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second
quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58
million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company’s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos
liability accrual. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by
approximately $30 million in 2017.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $77 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M’s defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. In addition, the
portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. These decreases
were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim,
commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities.

Year 2017 results:
 
Sales in Industrial totaled $10.9 billion, up 4.9 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.9 percent, divestitures
reduced sales by 0.5 percent, and foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5 percent.
 
On an organic local-currency sales basis:
·
Sales grew in all businesses, led by advanced materials, automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes, and
abrasives.
 
Acquisitions and divestitures:
·
There were no acquisitions or divestitures that closed during 2017. The year-on-year divestiture sales change was due to the
impact of 2016 activity.
 
Operating income:
·
Operating income margins decreased 2.0 percentage points, as divestiture impacts related to the first quarter 2016 sale of the
Polyfoam business resulted in a net year-on-year operating income margin reduction of 0.7 percentage points. In addition,
incremental strategic investments decreased margins by 1.0 percentage points.

Year 2016 results:
 
Sales totaled $10.4 billion, up 0.1 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales were flat, acquisitions added 1.6 percent, divestitures
reduced sales by 0.3 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.1 percent. The flat organic local-currency sales impact
reflected economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Industrial rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2016, when it reflected 4.5 percent
organic local-currency sales growth.
 
On an organic local-currency sales basis:
·
Sales grew in automotive and aerospace solutions, automotive aftermarket, and separation and purification.
·
Sales declined in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes.
·
Sales also declined in advanced materials, primarily due to persistent weakness in the oil and gas end markets.
 
Acquisitions and divestitures:
·
In October 2016, 3M sold the assets of its temporary protective films business.
·
In January 2016, 3M completed its sale of 3M’s pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as
Polyfoam).
·
Acquisition sales growth in 2016 related to the acquisition of Membrana (closed in August 2015), a leading provider of
microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial, and specialty segments.
 
Operating income:
·
Operating income margins increased 1.1 percentage points, helped by the gain on sale of Polyfoam and its temporary protective
films business, productivity benefits from fourth quarter 2015 restructuring actions, and lower raw materials costs.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AR
 
EA
 
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the
Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic
area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are
exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s
results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.
Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18.
 
Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:
 
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing
manufacturing efficiency. In 2017, 62% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and
Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more
closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with
proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section
entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA
 
TES
 
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.
 
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement
obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical
accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
 
Legal Proceedings:
 
The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates
of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled “Process
for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in
Note 15) for additional information about such estimates.
 
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
 
3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United
States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for
its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard
Codification (ASC) 715, 
Compensation — Retirement Benefits
, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the
amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit
pension or postretirement plan
39
 
Table of Contents
 
as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While the company believes the valuation
methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at
the reporting date. See Note 12 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and
postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
 
Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at
retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for
services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting
benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the
yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle
projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the
calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the
method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new
method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation.
Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is
determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not
affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses
recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and
interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company
accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.
 
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan
assets, which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from
active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for
2018 is 7.25%, equal to 2017. Refer to Note 12 for information on how the 2017 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for
international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected
long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.02% for 2018, compared
to 5.16% for 2017.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement
expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $333 million, up from $251 million in 2016. Defined
benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to
increase to approximately $409 million in 2018, an increase of $76 million compared to 2017.
 
The table below summarizes the impact on 2018 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point

Asset Impairments:
 
As of December 31, 2017, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.9 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion.
Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over
long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses.
These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance,
expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the
related asset group.
 
Of the $2.9 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose
tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary
valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach.
Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate
market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to
market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset,
impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017, no impairment was
indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 15 percent.
 
3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the
fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.
Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same
segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting
units for impairment testing.
 
An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically
uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive
operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition
to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted
cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.
 
As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that
resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated
reporting units. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting
units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth
quarter 2017 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
 
As of October 1, 2017, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill.
These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and
Systems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and
41
 
Table of Contents
 
Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated
fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 40 percent or more. 3M’s market value at both December
31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately $12 billion.
 
As discussed in Note 2, 3M announced the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets division, which is expected to close in
2018, which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately $270 million upon sale.
 
In 2017, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where
applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted
based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates
of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.
 
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus
many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion
of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in
the fourth quarter of 2017, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
 
Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in
competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in
Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing
results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment
for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a
definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset
group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived
assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2018 for any triggering events or
other indicators of impairment.
 
Income Taxes:
 
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude
of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions
and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records
tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, regarding uncertainty in
income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 9 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing
facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that
is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be
less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less
than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company
determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The
expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of
remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. As
discussed in Note 9, this expense is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year
following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI
 
TY
 
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access,
positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth
remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization
capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from
operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding
U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash
positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still
considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See
Note 9 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
 
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have
continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion
outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2017, there was approximately $745 million in
commercial paper issued and outstanding.
 
Total Debt:
 
The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the
Company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total
portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable
outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.
 
The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to
October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of
repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These are partially offset by June 2017
repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. For
discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.
 
Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers
an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated
May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to
the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal
amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in
2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and the 2017 debt referenced above, is approximately $13.1 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates
applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for
the periods presented is included in Note 11.
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75
billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request
an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is
undrawn at December 31, 2017. Under the $3.75 billion credit
43

agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1.
This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to
total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2017, this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do
not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and
bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business
activities.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
 
At December 31, 2017, 3M had $4.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.975 billion was
held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $180 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in
bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $2.35 billion and $350 million, respectively.
Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 10.
 
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
 
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The
Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes
net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial
position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Balance Sheet:
 
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward.
The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
 
The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets. These measures include
working capital, accounts receivable turns, and inventory turns.

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term
liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as
similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M
believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
44
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Working capital increased $1.1 billion during 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Current asset balance changes increased working
capital by $2.6 billion, driven by increases in cash/cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to higher accounts receivable and
inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.5 billion, largely due to increases in
short-term borrowings, with commercial paper outstanding of $745 million at December 31, 2017 compared to none outstanding at
December 31, 2016.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory Turns (non-GAAP measures):
 
Accounts receivable and inventory turns are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the
same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines accounts receivable turns as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4
divided by ending accounts receivable – net, and defines inventory turns as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending
inventory. 3M believes accounts receivable turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how efficiently the Company manages credit
and collects from its customers. For inventory turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and
engineering costs. 3M believes inventory turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how quickly inventory is sold. Details of these
calculations follow.

Accounts receivable increased $519 million year-on-year in 2017, primarily due to increased sales. In addition, foreign currency impacts
increased 2017 accounts receivable by $215 million and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased accounts receivable by $57 million. As a
result, accounts receivable turns decreased 2 percent versus 2016.
 
Inventory increased $649 million year-on-year in 2017. Foreign currency impacts increased 2017 inventory by $210 million and
acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased inventory by $51 million. Higher fourth quarter sales contributed to a 10 percent increase in cost
of sales, while inventory increased 19 percent, which combined contributed to an 8 percent decrease in inventory turns.
 
On a seasonal basis, both accounts receivable and inventory turns are historically higher at year-end, driven by lower year-end accounts
receivable and inventory balances.

Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be
considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax
interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it
focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.
 
In 2017, ROIC of 21.3 percent was lower than both 2016 and 2015. This decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the TCJA
and increases in commercial paper borrowings in conjunction with the December 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension plan contribution,
which combined reduced ROIC by 3 percentage points in 2017.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences
and other items can significantly impact cash flows.
 
In 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased
operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M
contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement
contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608
million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments
(net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the
“Financial Condition and Liquidity” section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement contributions and expense
is provided in Note 12, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations section. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding
table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2017 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale
of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities.
 
In 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $242 million compared to the same period in 2015, with this increase
primarily due to lower year-on-year cash taxes and higher net income. These items were partially offset by higher Company pension
contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $108 million in 2016,
compared to working capital increase of $46 million in 2015. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for
divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing
activities, not operating activities.

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing
manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2018 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to
invest in its businesses.
 
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity,
eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests
in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus research
facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities.
 
Investments included continued expansion and sustainment of current and new facilities across many geographies, focusing on growth,
productivity and capacity. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased
implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. Additional specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story,
400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.
 
Refer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments
and strategic alliances to strengthen its portfolio, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.
 
Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2017 primarily includes the purchase of Scott Safety. In 2015, this amount consisted mostly of the
Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2017 primarily relate to the divestiture of the assets of the
prescription safety eyewear, identity management, tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and electronic monitoring
businesses within the Safety and Graphics business segment. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2016 related to the divestiture of the assets
of the pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam) within the Industrial business segment and the
completion of the divestiture of the Library business within the Safety and Graphics business segment. In addition, in the fourth quarter of
2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business within the Industrial business segment and its cathode battery technology out-
licensing business within the Electronics and Energy business segment.
 
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are
primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are
classified as available-for-sale. Net proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities in 2015 were used to help fund the August
2015 acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana. Refer to Note 10 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio.
Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus cost method and equity investments.

2017 Debt Activity:
 
The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to
October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of
repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate
principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments
and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. Foreign
exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.
 
Proceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed
rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term
notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due
2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to Note 11 for more detail of these debt issuances.
 
In October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included
$110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70%
notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest
expense associated with the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.
 
2016 Debt Activity:
 
Total debt at December 31, 2016 increased $853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016
debt issuances (approximately $1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt issuances of approximately $1.75 billion.
This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016
along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8
million decrease), which is reflected in “Change in short-term debt—net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also
impacted debt balances.
 
Proceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed
rate medium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed
rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of
five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed
rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate
medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series
F).
 
2015 Debt Activity:
 
In 2015, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea.
Repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition. Proceeds from debt primarily
related to the May 2015 issuance of 650 million Euros aggregate principal amount of five-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2020,
600 million Euros aggregate principal amount of eight-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023, and 500 million Euros aggregate
principal amount of fifteen-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2030, which in the aggregate total approximately $1.9 billion at issue
date exchange rates. In addition, August 2015 issuances included $450 million aggregate principal amount of three-year fixed rate medium-
term notes due 2018, $500 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2020, and $550 million
aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2025, which in aggregate total $1.5 billion.

Repurchases of Common Stock:
 
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate
purposes. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock.
This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of
$3.8 billion and $5.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2018 gross share repurchases to be between
$2.0 billion to $5.0 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The
Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
 
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
 
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.803 billion ($4.70 per share) in 2017, $2.678 billion ($4.44 per share) in 2016, and $2.561
billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018
dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.44 per share and marked the 60th
consecutive year of dividend increases.
 
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal
payments for capital leases. In addition, in 2017, this included a payment related to the $96 million in interest expense associated with
premiums and fees for the early retirement of debt. See Note 11 for additional details.
 
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
 
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they
should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less
purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary
expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company
believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the
Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year
is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow
conversion for 2017, 2016 and 2015.
 
In 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600
million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3
percentage points. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted
operating cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital spending for property,
plant and equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Refer to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 15 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
 
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify
either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or
the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s
maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Long-term debt payments due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $54 million, $71 million, and $95 million,
respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The
expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As
discussed in Note 9, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year
following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the
Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital
commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one
year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts,
in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive
consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the
preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation
amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is
contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this
reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
 
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the
current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months.
The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, other than the transition tax prescribed under the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which is separately included in the table
51
 
Table of Contents
 
above, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of
$523 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 9 for further details.
 
As discussed in Note 12, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018
and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore,
amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMEN
 
TS
 
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks
using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these
arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply
contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
 
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk,
interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
 
Item 7A. 
Quantitative
 
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management
provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives,
and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to
control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company
actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks
and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
 
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:
 
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may
cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency
earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange
rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may
dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time
over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters
into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain
intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As
circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging
instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the
Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.6 billion
at December 31, 2017. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not
designated as hedging instruments was $5.0 billion at December 31, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had 4.4
billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-
52
 
Table of Contents
 
derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 13 in the “Net Investment Hedges” section.
 
Interest Rates Risk:
 
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate
risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated
and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on
inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2017 was $2.0
billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note 11, including references to information regarding derivatives
and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 13, associated with the Company’s long-term debt.
 
Commodity Prices Risk:
 
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price
swaps. 3M used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility, but
discontinued this practice in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other
comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected
earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of
certain commodities and precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were
outstanding at December 31, 2017 was not material.
 
Value At Risk:
 
The value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and
commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments
(primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2017. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95
percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates
related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be
experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would
not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to
these exposures.

In addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates, recent historical
information is as follows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $111
million and $127 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into
U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and
transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that
year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 million in
2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price
change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $75 million per year. The global energy
53
 
Table of Contents
 
exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Global
energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.

Management’s Responsibility
 
 for Financial Reporting
 
Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the
financial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment.
 
Management has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This
system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified
personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control
over financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to
require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the
accounting and control system.
 
3M Company
 
Management’s Report
 
 on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management
conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
. Management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 excluded Scott Safety, which was
acquired by the Company in October 2017 in a purchase business combination. Scott Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets
and total net sales both represented less than 1 percent of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2017. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting
during the first year of acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective.
 
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 3M Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We
also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
 
Basis for Opinions
 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Scott Safety from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase
business combination during 2017.  We have also excluded Scott Safety from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Scott
Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal
control over financial reporting both represent less than 1 percent of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2017.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
 
NOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies
 
 
Consolidation:
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries
are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
Basis of presentation: 
Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
 
Foreign currency translation:
 Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and
liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and
expense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
 
3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which are remeasured under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 830,
Foreign Currency Matters
, as if its functional currency were that of its parent because Venezuela’s economic environment is considered
highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary is immaterial as a percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2017. The
Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local
currency. The government also operates various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and
replaced from time to time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the
financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary auction mechanism,
Tipo de Cambio Complementario, which was redesigned by the Venezuelan government in June 2017 (DICOM2), or its predecessor.
During the same periods, the Venezuelan government’s official exchange was Tipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. 3M’s
uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company’s
Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining
currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The
Company continues to monitor these circumstances. Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange mechanisms may continue in the
future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net monetary assets (liabilities)
denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a balance of net monetary assets denominated in
VEF of less than 10 billion VEF and the DIPRO and DICOM2 exchange rates were approximately 10 VEF and 3,300 VEF per U.S. dollar,
respectively.
 
A need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated
cash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M
monitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability
to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and
economic situation within Venezuela. Based upon a review of factors as of December 31, 2017, the Company continues to consolidate its
Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this subsidiary was
approximately $145 million and the amount of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its total equity balance were not
significant.
 
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less
when acquired.
62
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Marketable securities:
 Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold
use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for
use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance
provided by ASC 320
, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities
, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or
“other-than-temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income as a component of shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period
because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary
include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as
other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or “other-than-
temporary” impairment.
 
Investments:
 Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale
investments are recorded at fair value at each reporting date and subject to ASC 320, as described above.
 
Other assets: 
Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the
balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums
paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments”
and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively.
 
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
 
Property, plant and equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are
recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the
majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen
years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are
retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to
operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount
of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is
generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Conditional asset retirement obligations: 
A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional
asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using
expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs
are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $106 million and $111
million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Goodwill: 
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested
for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level,
63
 
Table of Contents
 
with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be
combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting
units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets
exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by
a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which
is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.
 
Intangible assets: 
Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets
acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a
systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,
with customer related largely between eight to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based
largely between two to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely
between two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in
“Research, development and related expenses.”
 
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the
excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for
impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that
the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value
of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
 
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract
termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related
severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in
the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated
actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination
dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the
employees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end
of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred
under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.
 
Revenue (sales) recognition:
 The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no
material concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to
customers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. The Company records
estimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at
the time of the initial sale. These sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, 
Revenue Recognition
. The estimated
reductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the
various markets served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most
common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. Free goods are
accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
 
64
 
Table of Contents
 
The vast majority of 3M’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the
product or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements (such as
equipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and conditions.
 
For non-software multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone
value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights.
Arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. The selling price used for each
deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to
establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded
until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the
functionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.
 
For arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant
production, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is recognized when the Company has
VSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. When the
arrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional
performance is employed.
 
For prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence
indicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized
until the inception of the license term.
 
On occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For these agreements,
and depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to
date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
 
Accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company
maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and
product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales
returns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and
historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant
off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
 
Advertising and merchandising:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $411 million in 2017, $385 million
in 2016 and $368 million in 2015.
 
Research, development and related expenses:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line
of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.850 billion in 2017, $1.735 billion in 2016
and $1.763 billion in 2015. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific
advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.335 billion in 2017, $1.225 billion in 2016 and $1.223
billion in 2015. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees
incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research
and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method
effects and impairments.
 
Internal-use software:
 The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use
as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless
another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery
and equipment or capital leases within
65
 
Table of Contents
 
property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and
accumulated depreciation accounts.
 
Environmental:
 Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when
they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a
plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
 
Income taxes:
 The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income
taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and
liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had valuation allowances of $81 million and $47 million on its deferred tax assets,
respectively. The increase in valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 relates to certain U.S. and international jurisdictions with taxable
loss or tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire prior to utilization. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax
positions based on the rules under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
.
 
Earnings per share:
 The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share
attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain
options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (0.8
million average options for 2017, 3.6 million average options for 2016, and 5.0 million average options for 2015). The computations for
basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include
stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan
(GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the
recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to
income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on
the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax
deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. Beginning in 2016, as a
result of 3M’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting
, these excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the
statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of
excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option
exercises. Prior to 2016, excess tax benefits were
66
 
Table of Contents
 
recognized in additional paid-in capital within equity, and, with respect to statement of cash flows, were reflected as a financing cash inflow.
Based on the adoption methodology of ASU No. 2016-09 applied, periods prior to 2016 were not changed.
 
Comprehensive income:
 Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international
companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity
securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
 
Derivatives and hedging activities:
 All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and
option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled
are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in
current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows
from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
 
Credit risk:
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The
Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major
international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when
possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts
owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and
may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
 
Fair value measurements:
 3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the
measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs
are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent
of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in
valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into
three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Acquisitions: 
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
.  This standard requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among
67
 
Table of Contents
 
other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent
consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and in
August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard as to effective date. The ASU provides a single comprehensive model
to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance,
including industry-specific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the
contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction
price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard also
specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016, the FASB also issued ASU
No. 2016-08, 
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)
; ASU No. 2016-10, 
Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing
; ASU No. 2016-12, 
Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients
, and ASU No. 2016-20, 
Technical
Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 which amend ASU No. 2014-09. These amendments
include clarification of principal versus agent guidance in situations in which a revenue transaction involves a third party in providing goods
or services to a customer. In such circumstances, an entity must determine whether the nature of its promise to the customer is to provide the
underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the principal in the transaction) or to arrange for the third party to provide the underlying
goods or services (i.e., the entity is the agent in the transaction). The amendments clarify, in terms of identifying performance obligations,
how entities would determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable from other promises in a contract and,
therefore, would be accounted for separately. The guidance allows entities to disregard goods or services that are immaterial in the context
of a contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs rather than as
additional promised services. With regard to licensing, the amendments clarify how an entity would evaluate the nature of its promise in
granting a license of intellectual property, which determines whether the entity recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. The
amendments also address implementation issues relative to transition (adding a practical expedient for contract modifications and clarifying
what constitutes a completed contract when employing full or modified retrospective transition methods), collectability, noncash
consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar-type taxes (allowing entities to exclude sales-type taxes collected from
transaction price). Finally, the amendments provide additional guidance in the areas of disclosure of performance obligations, provisions for
losses on certain types of contracts, scoping, and other areas. Overall, ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, provides for either full retrospective
adoption or a modified retrospective adoption by which it is applied only to the most current period presented. For 3M, the ASU is effective
January 1, 2018 and the Company has concluded that it will utilize the modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company has
completed analyses, executed project management relative to the process of adopting this ASU, and conducted detailed contract reviews to
complete necessary adjustments to existing accounting policies and quantify the ASU’s effect. For most of 3M’s revenue arrangements,
there are no impacts as these transactions are not accounted for under industry-specific guidance that will be superseded by the ASU and
generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or services. 3M also engages in some arrangements for
which software industry-specific guidance (which the ASU supersedes) is presently utilized. The Company also considered these
arrangements in the detailed contract reviews that have been conducted. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No.
2014-09, it does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, 
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
, which changes guidance related to both
the variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard
changes, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the
VIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the
ASU eliminates the presumption that a
68
 
Table of Contents
 
general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise be overcome. Under the new guidance,
a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model. The Company adopted this ASU
effective January 1, 2016. Because 3M did not have significant involvement with entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted
by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships potentially impacted by the VOE model changes, the adoption did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, 
Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement
, which requires a
customer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license,
the customer would account for fees related to the software license element in a manner consistent with accounting for the acquisition of
other acquired software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as
a service contract. An arrangement would contain a software license element if both (1) the customer has the contractual right to take
possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either
run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. 3M adopted this ASU
prospectively to arrangements entered into, or materially modified beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact
on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, 
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
, which modifies existing requirements
regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of
replacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit margin. The new ASU replaces market with
NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and
transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV less an approximately normal profit margin
when measuring inventory. 3M adopted this standard prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact
on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
, which
revises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain
fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the
fair value of financial instruments. The new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other
ownership interests in an entity, including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies
(collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to
measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding
gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other comprehensive income (OCI). They
also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be
permitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in
orderly transactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair
value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be
required to separately present in OCI the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to
reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not apply to derivative instruments required to be measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018 via a cumulative-effect
adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values which is
applied prospectively. Because the Company has historically held limited amounts of equity securities (less than $75 million in aggregate at
December 31, 2017), and has not elected the FVO with respect to material financial liabilities, it does not expect this standard to have a
material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduces a
lessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income
statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make
69
 
Table of Contents
 
fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related
accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating
how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-
specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The standard requires modified retrospective transition by
which it is applied at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption. For 3M, the ASU is effective
January 1, 2019. Information under existing lease guidance with respect to rent expense for operating leases and the Company’s minimum
lease payments for capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess one year as of December 31, 2017 is included in Note
15. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, 
Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments
. This ASU clarifies guidance
used to determine if debt instruments that contain contingent put or call options would require separation of the embedded put or call
feature from the debt instrument and trigger accounting for the feature as a derivative with changes in fair value recorded through income.
Under the new guidance, fewer put or call options embedded in debt instruments would require derivative accounting. For 3M, this ASU
was effective January 1, 2017. The Company’s outstanding debt with embedded put provisions did not require separate derivative
accounting under existing guidance. As a result, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, 
Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting
, which eliminates the
existing requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively (revising prior periods as if the equity method had always
been applied) when an entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The new guidance would require the investor
to apply the equity method prospectively from the date the investment qualifies for the equity method. The investor would add the carrying
value of the existing investment to the cost of any additional investment to determine the initial cost basis of the equity method investment.
For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis. 3M will apply this guidance to investments that transition to the
equity method after the adoption date.
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, which revises guidance for the
accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope. The new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to
estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The
new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured
at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net
investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amends the
current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such securities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any
impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting that credit
loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt security, the ASU requires that credit losses be
reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions
thereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to
apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in
which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated result of operations and
financial condition.
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, 
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
 which is intended to
reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The
standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity
method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of
cash flows. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-15 as of January 1, 2017. Since the associated changes in classification were
immaterial to all
70
 
Table of Contents
 
prior periods presented, no impact was reflected in the Company’s pre-2017 consolidated results of operations and financial condition
presented.
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, 
Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
, which modifies existing
guidance and is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity
transfers of assets. The ASU indicates that the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax
effects of certain intercompany transactions would apply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no
longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g., intangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense
associated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is eliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and
recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated group. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from
recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. For 3M, this ASU is effective January
1, 2018. The standard requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the
period of adoption. Upon adoption, a company would write off any income tax effects that had been deferred from past intercompany
transactions involving non-inventory assets to opening retained earnings. In addition, an entity would record deferred tax assets with an
offset to opening retained earnings for amounts that entity had previously not recognized under existing guidance but would recognize under
the new guidance. Based on deferred tax amounts related to applicable past intercompany transactions as of December 31, 2017, the
Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, 
Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control
, which
modifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) through a
common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to
be consolidated. Under the ASU, a decision maker would need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a
common control party. Previous guidance had required the decision maker to treat the common control party’s interest in the VIE as if the
decision maker held the interest itself. As a result of the ASU, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change. For 3M, the
standard was effective January 1, 2017 with retrospective application to January 1, 2016. 3M does not have significant involvement with
entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by VIE model factors. As a result, the adoption of this ASU did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash
, which clarifies guidance on the classification and presentation of
restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents would be included
along with those of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities would no longer present transfers between
cash/equivalents and restricted cash/equivalents in the statement of cash flows. In addition, a reconciliation between the balance sheet and
the statement of cash flows would be disclosed when the balance sheet includes more than one line item for cash/equivalents and restricted
cash/equivalents. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-18 as of January 1, 2017. Due to the immaterial use of restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents, no impact was reflected in the Company’s pre-2017 consolidated results of operations and financial condition
presented.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, 
Clarifying the Definition of a Business
, which narrows the existing definition of a
business and provides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a
business. The ASU requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single
identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a
business. To be considered a business, the set would need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute
to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of outputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting
such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets are expected to be considered businesses. For
3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. 3M would apply this guidance to applicable
transactions after the adoption date.
 
71

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, 
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
. Under the new standard, goodwill
impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying
value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the
implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. For 3M, this ASU is effective prospectively to impairment tests beginning
January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. 3M adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2017 in conjunction with its annual goodwill
impairment testing. The adoption did not have an impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, 
Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial
Sales of Nonfinancial Assets
. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No.
2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The new standard clarifies the accounting for derecognition of nonfinancial assets and
defines what is considered an in substance nonfinancial asset. Nonfinancial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and
intellectual property that do not constitute a business. The new ASU impacts entities derecognizing (e.g. selling) nonfinancial assets (or in
substance nonfinancial assets), including partial interests therein, when the purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, the seller
would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, even though
the purchaser is not a customer. For 3M, this new standard is effective coincident with the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No.
2014-09. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, 
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost
. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit
plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic
benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and only the service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets
such as inventory. All other net periodic benefit costs components (such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost
amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) would be reported outside of operating income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1,
2018 on a retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component is applied on prospective
basis. The components of 3M’s net periodic defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit costs are presented in Note 12. These include
components totaling a benefit of $129 million, $195 million, and a detriment of $34 million, for the fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015,
respectively, that would no longer be included within operating expenses and instead would be reported outside of income from operations
under the new standard. Further, the capitalization of service cost change is not expected to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08
, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities
, which amends the
amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under existing standards, entities generally amortize
the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life of the instrument. The new guidance shortens the amortization period to the
earliest call date for certain callable debt securities that have explicit, noncontingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset
date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019
with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first
reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Early adoption is permitted. 3M’s marketable security portfolio includes very limited
instances of callable debt securities held at a premium. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on
3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09
, Scope of Modification Accounting
, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions
of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The general model for accounting for modifications of share-
based payment awards is to record the incremental value arising from the changes as additional compensation cost. Under the new standard,
fewer changes to the terms of an award would require accounting under this modification model. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1,
2018, with early adoption permitted. Because the Company does not typically make changes to the terms or conditions of its issued share-
based payment
72
 
Table of Contents
 
awards, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-10, 
Determining the Customer of the Operation Services
, that clarifies how an operating
entity determines the customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of a service concession arrangement. Service
concession arrangements are typically agreements between a grantor and an operating entity whereby the operating entity will operate the
grantor’s infrastructure (i.e. airports, roadways, bridges, and prisons) for a specified period of time. The operating entity also may be
required to maintain the infrastructure and provide capital-intensive maintenance to enhance or extend its life. In such arrangements,
typically the operation services (i.e. operation and maintenance of a roadway) would be used by third parties (i.e. drivers). The ASU clarifies
that the grantor, not the third party, is the customer of the operation services in such arrangements. For 3M, this new standard is effective
coincident with the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Because the Company is not typically a party to agreements
within the scope of accounting for service concession arrangements, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, 
(Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part
II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain
Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception
. The new standard applies to issuers of financial instruments with
down-round features. A down-round provision is a term in an equity-linked financial instrument (i.e. a freestanding warrant contract or an
equity conversion feature embedded within a host debt or equity contract) that triggers a downward adjustment to the instrument’s strike
price (or conversion price) if equity shares are issued at a lower price (or equity-linked financial instruments are issued at a lower strike
price) than the instrument’s then-current strike price. The purpose of the feature is typically to protect the instrument’s counterparty from
future issuances of equity shares at a more favorable price. The ASU amends (1) the classification of such instruments as liabilities or equity
by revising the certain guidance relative to evaluating if they must be accounted for as derivative instruments and (2) the guidance on
recognition and measurement of freestanding equity-classified instruments. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. Because the Company has not issued financial instruments with down-round features, 3M does not expect this ASU to
have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, 
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
. The ASU amends
existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow companies to better align their hedge
accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to qualify for hedge
accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge
relationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead
of a quantitative test and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting
by eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment
hedges, the entire change in fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive
income and reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the
hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges, generally, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be
presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of
interest rate risks and expands an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. In addition, the guidance also eases
certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and
requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with a
modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the
adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.

NOTE 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
 
Acquisitions:
 
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors,
growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the
existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses.
 
In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain
enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset
purchase and investment activity.
 
2017 acquisitions:
 
In September 2017, 3M purchased all of the ownership interests of Elution Technologies, LLC, a Vermont-based manufacturer of test kits
that help enable food and beverage companies ensure their products are free from certain potentially harmful allergens such as peanuts, soy
or milk. Elution is reported within the Company’s Health Care business.
 
In October 2017, 3M completed the acquisition of the underlying legal entities and associated assets of Scott Safety, which is headquartered
in Monroe, North Carolina, from Johnson Controls for $2.0 billion of cash, net of cash acquired. Scott Safety is a premier manufacturer of
innovative products, including self-contained breathing apparatus systems, gas and flame detection instruments, and other safety devices
that complement 3M’s personal safety portfolio. The business had revenues of approximately $570 million in 2016. Scott Safety is reported
within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. The allocation of purchase consideration related to Scott Safety is considered preliminary with
provisional amounts primarily related to intangible assets and certain tax-related, contingent liability and working capital items. 3M expects
to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one year measurement-period following the acquisition.
 
Pro forma information related to acquisitions has not been included because the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
was not considered material. The following table shows the impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations
related to 2017 acquisitions and assigned finite-lived intangible asset weighted-average lives.

Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2017 totaled $855 million. The associated finite-lived
intangible assets acquired in 2017 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life
of 15 years (lives ranging from four to 17 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which
significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.
 
2016 acquisitions:
 
In September 2016, 3M acquired all of the outstanding shares of Semfinder, headquartered in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. Semfinder is a
leading developer of precision software that enables efficient coding of medical procedures in multiple languages. The purchase price paid
for these business combinations (net of cash acquired) during 2016 aggregated to $16 million. Semfinder is reported within 3M’s Health
Care business.
 
Adjustments in 2016 to the preliminary purchase price allocations of other acquisitions within the allocation period primarily related to the
identification of contingent liabilities and certain tax-related items aggregating to approximately $35 million along with other balances
related to the 2015 acquisition of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. The change to provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial impact to the
results of operations in the third quarter of 2016, a portion of which related to earlier quarters in the measurement period.
 
Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2016 totaled $4 million. The associated finite-lived
intangible assets acquired in 2016 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life
of 8 years (lives ranging from two to 20 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which
significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.
 
2015 acquisitions:
 
In March 2015, 3M purchased all of the outstanding shares of Ivera Medical Corp., headquartered in San Diego, California. Ivera Medical
Corp. is a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices used for access into a patient’s bloodstream and is reported
within 3M’s Health Care business. In addition, in the first quarter of
75
 
Table of Contents
 
2015, 3M purchased the remaining interest in a former equity method investment reported within 3M’s Industrial business for an immaterial
amount.
 
In August 2015, 3M acquired all of the outstanding shares of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L., with operating headquarters in Bloomington,
Minnesota, from KKR & Co. L.P. for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The net assets acquired included the assumption of $0.8 billion of
debt. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and is reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
In August 2015, 3M acquired the assets and liabilities associated with Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media business (hereafter
referred to as Membrana), headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, for $1.0 billion. Membrana is a leading provider of microporous
membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments and is reported within 3M’s Industrial business.
 
The impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2015 acquisitions and assigned weighted-average
intangible asset lives, including adjustments relative to other acquisitions within the measurement period, follows. Adjustments in 2015 to
the preliminary allocations primarily related to the identification and valuation of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. The change to
provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial impact to results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015, a portion of which relates to
earlier quarters in the measurement period.

Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2015 totaled $1.0 billion. The associated finite-lived
intangible assets acquired in 2015 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life
of 14 years (lives ranging from two to 20 years). Indefinite-lived intangible assets of $520 million relate to certain tradenames associated
with the Capital Safety acquisition which have been in existence for over 55 years, have a history of leading market-share positions, have
been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an
indefinite period of time. Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant

assumed renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.
 
Divestitures:
 
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors
relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling
the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders.
 
In January 2015, 3M completed the sale of its global Static Control business to Desco Industries Inc., based in Chino, California. 2014 sales
of this business were $46 million. This transaction was not considered material and was reported within 3M’s Electronics and Energy
business.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M entered into agreements with One Equity Partners Capital Advisors L.P. (OEP) to sell the assets of 3M’s
library systems business. The sales of the North American business and the majority of the business outside of North America closed in
October and November 2015, respectively. The sale of the remainder of the library systems business closed in the first quarter of 2016
(discussed further below). In December 2015, 3M also completed the sale of Faab Fabricauto, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M, to Hills
Numberplates Limited. The library systems business, part of the former Traffic Safety and Security Division, delivers circulation
management solutions to library customers with on-premise hardware and software, maintenance and service, and an emerging cloud-based
digital lending platform. Faab Fabricauto, also part of the former Traffic Safety and Security Division, is a leading French manufacturer of
license plates and signage solutions. The aggregate cash proceeds relative to the 2015 global library systems and Faab Fabricauto divestiture
transactions was $104 million. The Company recorded within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business a net pre-tax gain of $40 million in 2015
as a result of the sale and any adjustment of carrying value.
 
In the first quarter of 2016, 3M completed the sale of the remainder of the assets of 3M’s library systems business to One Equity Partners
Capital Advisors L.P. (OEP). 3M had previously sold the North American business and the majority of the business outside of North
America to OEP in the fourth quarter of 2015 which was reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. Also in the first quarter of
2016, 3M sold to Innovative Chemical Products Group, a portfolio company of Audax Private Equity, the assets of 3M’s pressurized
polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam). This business is a provider of pressurized polyurethane foam
adhesive formulations and systems into the residential roofing, commercial roofing and insulation and industrial foam segments in the
United States with annual sales of approximately $20 million and was reported within 3M’s Industrial business. The Company recorded a
pre-tax gain of $40 million in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the sales of these businesses.
 
In October 2016, 3M sold the assets of its temporary protective films business to Pregis LLC. This business, with annual sales of
approximately $50 million, is a provider of adhesive-backed temporary protective films used in a broad range of industries and was reported
within 3M’s Industrial business. In December 2016, 3M sold the assets of its cathode battery technology out-licensing business, with annual
sales of approximately $10 million, to UMICORE. This business was reported within 3M’s Electronics and Energy business. The aggregate
selling price relative to these two businesses was $86 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million in the fourth quarter of
2016 as a result of the sales of these businesses.
 
In January 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, with annual sales of approximately $45 million, to HOYA
Vision Care. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $29 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this sale, which was reported
within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
In May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable, of its identity management business to Gemalto N.V. This
business, with 2016 sales of approximately $205 million, is a leading provider in identity management solutions, including biometric
hardware and software that enable identity verification and authentication, as well as secure materials and document readers. In June 2017,
3M also completed the sale of its tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business, with annual sales of approximately $40
million, to Neology, Inc. 3M’s tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business includes RFID readers and tags, automatic
vehicle
77

classification systems, lane controller and host software, and back office software and services. It also provides mobile and fixed cameras,
software, and services in automated license/number plate recognition. 3M received proceeds of $833 million, or $809 million net of cash
sold, and reflected a pre-tax gain of $458 million as a result of these two divestitures, which was reported within the Company’s Safety and
Graphics business.
 
In October 2017, 3M sold its electronic monitoring business to an affiliate of Apax Partners. This business, with annual sales of
approximately $95 million, is a provider of electronic monitoring technologies, serving hundreds of correctional and law enforcement
agencies around the world. 3M received proceeds of $201 million, net of cash sold, and reflected a pre-tax gain of $98 million in the fourth
quarter of 2017 as a result of this divestiture, which was reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M sold the assets of an electrical marking/labeling business within its Electronics and Energy business. The
former activity, proceeds and gain were not considered material.
 
In December 2017, 3M agreed to sell substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated, for $900 million,
subject to closing and other adjustments. This business, with annual sales of approximately $400 million consists of optical fiber and copper
passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M’s xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in
certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. This sale is expected to close in 2018, subject to consultation or
information requirements with relevant works councils and to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The 3M expects a pre-
tax gain of approximately $500 million as a result of this divestiture that will be reported within the Company’s Electronics and Energy
business.
 
In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat
stress monitoring to TSI, Inc. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax
gain of less than $20 million that will be reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
The aggregate operating income of these businesses was approximately $45 million, $50 million and not significant in 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The approximate amounts of major assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included the following:

Purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $1.3 billion in 2017, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. Purchased goodwill from
acquisitions totaled $14 million in 2016, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition activity in the following table also
includes the net impact of adjustments to the preliminary allocation of purchase price within the one year measurement-period following
prior acquisitions, which increased goodwill by $39 million during 2016. The amounts in the “Translation and other” column in the

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a
change in reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units
correspond to a division.
 
As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort
to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes,
the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first
quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new
structure and determined that no impairment existed. The Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter
of 2017 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. In addition, the Company had no impairments of goodwill in prior
years.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal
(approximately $7 million), state (approximately $12 million), and international (approximately $70 million), with all amounts net before
valuation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after 5 to 10 years, and the international
after one to three years or have an indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have
tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of taxable income. As of December 31, 2017, the Company
has provided $81 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management’s determination that it is
more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.

Effective worldwide tax rate

%
 
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points, impacted by
several factors. Primary factors that increased the Company’s effective tax rate included the impacts due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) being enacted in 2017 (see further information below) and remeasurements and establishment of 3M’s uncertain tax positions.
Combined, these factors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 12.1 percentage points. The increase was partially offset by a 4.9
percentage point decrease, which related to international taxes that were impacted by increasing benefits from the Company’s supply chain
centers of expertise, changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and prior year cash optimization actions, higher year-on-year
excess tax benefit for employee share-based payment, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, a reduction of state taxes, and other
items.
 
The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points, impacted by several
factors. Primary factors that decreased the Company’s effective tax rate included the recognition of excess tax benefits beginning in 2016
related to employee share-based payments (resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, as discussed in Note 1) and a reduction in state
taxes. Combined, these factors decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 3.2 percentage points. The decrease was partially offset by a
2.4 percentage point increase, which related to remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions and international taxes that were impacted
by changes to both the geographic mix of income before taxes and additional tax expense related to global cash optimization actions.
 
The TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21
percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for enactment effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to
one year from the TCJA’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, to the
extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable
estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be
included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect
immediately before the enactment of the TCJA.
 
In connection with 3M’s initial analysis of the impact of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762
million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For various reasons that are discussed more fully below, including
87
 
Table of Contents
 
the issuance of additional technical and interpretive guidance, 3M has not completed its accounting for the income tax effects of certain
elements of the TCJA. However, with respect to the following, 3M was able to make reasonable estimates of the TCJA’s effects and, as
such, recorded provisional amounts:
 
Transition tax
: The transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (E&P) of certain of the
Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the transition tax, 3M must determine, in addition to other factors, the
amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. Further, the
transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. 3M was able to make a reasonable
estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional obligation and additional income tax expense of $745 million in the fourth quarter
of 2017. However, the Company is continuing to gather additional information and will consider additional technical guidance to more
precisely compute and account for the amount of the transition tax. This amount may change when 3M finalizes the calculation of post-1986
foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. The TCJA’s
transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, 3M reflected $122 million and $623 million in
current accrued income taxes and long term income taxes payable, respectively.
 
Remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts:
 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the
rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. 3M is still analyzing certain aspects
of the TCJA, considering additional technical guidance, and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of
these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. This includes the potential impacts of the global low-taxed income
(“GILTI”) provision within the TCJA on deferred tax assets/liabilities. 3M also is considering other impacts of the 2017 enactment of the
TCJA including, but not limited to effects on the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion. As discussed further below in this Note 9,
3M previously has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to
be reinvested indefinitely. The full effects of underlying tax rates of the TCJA causes some reassessment of previous indefinite reinvestment
assertions with respect to certain jurisdictions. While 3M was able to make a reasonable estimate of these impacts, it may be affected by
other analyses related to the TCJA, including, but not limited to, the calculation of the transition tax on deferred foreign income. The
provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts was a net additional
income tax expense of $17 million.
 
3M has not completed its full analysis with respect to the GILTI provision within the TCJA and is not yet able to make reasonable estimates
of its related effects. Therefore, no provisional adjustments relative to GILTI were recorded. Currently, 3M has not yet elected a policy as to
whether it will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or whether 3M will account for GILTI as period
costs if and when incurred. 3M is not aware of other elements of the TCJA for which the Company was not yet able to make reasonable
estimates of the enactment impact and for which it would continue accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax
laws in effect before the TCJA.
 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.
 
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2014. The
Company protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the IRS. In
December 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the
first quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year.
 
Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It is
anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2015 by the end of the third quarter of 2018, for 2016 by the end
of the first quarter of 2018, and for 2017 by the end of the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2017, the IRS has not proposed any
significant adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.

Payments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2017 examinations may not be made until a final agreement
is reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals
process or judicial action. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign
jurisdictions.
 
3M anticipates changes to the Company’s uncertain tax positions due to the closing and resolution of audit issues for various audit years
mentioned above and closure of statutes. Currently, the Company is estimating a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12
months as a result of anticipated resolutions of audit issues.
 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:

The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $526 million as of December 31, 2017, $333 million as of
December 31, 2016, and $369 million as of December 31, 2015. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such
as Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other
Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the
consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $20 million of expense, $10 million of expense, and $2 million of expense
in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or
remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, accrued interest and penalties in the
consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $68 million and $52 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts
are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about
the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the
shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to
an earlier period.
 
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the
following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Thailand (2018),
China (2019), Korea (2019), Switzerland (2023), Singapore (2025), and Brazil (2073). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status
of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $228 million (37 cents per diluted share) in 2017, $142 million (23 cents per diluted share) in 2016,
and $114 million (18 cents per diluted share) in 2015.
 
The Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to
be reinvested indefinitely. As noted above, the effects of the TCJA caused some reassessment of previous indefinite reinvestment assertions
with respect to certain jurisdictions. While 3M was able to make a reasonable estimate of these impacts, it may be affected by other analyses
related to the TCJA. The unremitted earnings relate to

ongoing operations and were approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2017. Because of the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the
earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax
liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.
 
NOTE 10.  Marketable Securities
 
 
The Company invests in asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities. The following

3M has a diversified marketable securities portfolio. Within this portfolio, asset-backed securities primarily include interests in automobile
loans, credit cards and other asset-backed securities. 3M’s investment policy allows investments in asset-backed securities with minimum
credit ratings of Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA- by Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must
be rated by at least two of the aforementioned rating agencies, one of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At
December 31, 2017, all asset-backed security investments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 90 percent of all asset-backed
security investments were rated AAA or A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or AAA or F1+ by
Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed
securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the
liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. 3M does not

currently expect risk related to its holding in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity.

Long-term debt payments due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $54 million (classified as current portion of long-
term debt), $71 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table), and $95 million (included within the long-term debt
table), respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
 
Credit Facilities
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75
billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request
an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility was
undrawn at December 31, 2017. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest
Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated
total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31,
2017, this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
 
Other Credit Facilities
 
Apart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued
and outstanding at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.

Long-Term Debt Issuances
 
The principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table
found at the beginning of this note.
 
In October 2017, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate
of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and
$500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%.
 
In May 2016, 3M issued 1 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In September 2016, 3M issued $1.75 billion
aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.
 
In May 2015, 3M issued 1.750 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion
aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps as fair value
hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note, and
the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index.
 
Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments
 
In June 2017, 3M repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes that matured.
 
In October 2017, 3M, via cash tender offers, repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included
$110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70%
notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of approximately $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017
within interest expense, the cash outflow for which is recorded within other financing activities on the statement of cash flows. This charge
reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.
 
In September 2016, 3M repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.
 
Floating Rate Notes
 
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at
various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004,
3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note
due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity.
Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of
issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the
periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.
 
NOTE 12.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
 
 
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In
total, 3M has over 75 defined benefit plans in 27 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each
participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed
to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for
its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1,
2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided
postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.
 
93
 
Table of Contents
 
The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies
are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due
to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to
annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.
 
3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has a significant credit
balance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act funding requirements.
 
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to
substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5%
of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees
hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation
and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All
contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined
contribution plans were $159 million, $139 million and $165 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various
international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans
were $88 million, $87 million and $77 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
As a result of changes made to its U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans in 2010, the Company has transitioned all current and future
retirees to a savings account benefits-based plan. These changes became effective beginning January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible
retirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and
their eligible dependents. In August 2015, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the
future benefit for participants not retired as of January 1, 2016. For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, the Retiree Medical Savings
Account (RMSA) is no longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement
Arrangement is reduced from 3 percent to 1.5 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). Also effective
January 1, 2016, 3M no longer offers 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires.
 
3M was informed in 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold limited partnership
interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading
Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and six other limited partners of WG Trading Company, the district court judge
ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan (and in April 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). The benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests were adjusted to
reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement dates. In the first
quarter of 2014, 3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit that was removed by the insurers to the U.S. District Court for the District
of Minnesota against five insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In September 2015, the court ruled in
favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and the 3M
benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In May 2017, the appellate court affirmed
the lower court’s decision. The decision reduced U.S. pension and postretirement plan assets by $73 million at the December 31, 2017
measurement date and did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
As part of a diversified investment strategy, the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans made investments in the natural gas fired
power generation industry during the period 2011 through 2013. In April 2017, one of these entities, Panda Temple Power, LLC, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This investment loss represented less than one
percent of the fair value of the U.S. pension and postretirement plans’ assets and was reflected in the fair value measurement as of December
31, 2017.
 
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets
as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective
years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement

The balance of amounts recognized for international plans in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31 in the preceding
table are presented based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date.
 
The pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation
as of the measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation of the
U.S. pension plans was $16.270 billion and $15.149 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The accumulated benefit
obligation of the international pension plans was $6.870 billion and $6.058 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
The following amounts relate to pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31:

The Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The
contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to
January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has
material exposure to health care cost inflation.
 
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and
postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the
current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the
yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle
projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 3.68% for pension and 3.79% for
postretirement benefits to be appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2017, which is a decrease of 0.53 percentage points and 0.47
percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2016. For the international pension and postretirement plans the
discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country
has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that
generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep
market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields. 
 
Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other
postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied
to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows.
The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot
yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the
actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise
measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve
rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the
change to the spot yield curve approach, 2016 annual defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost decreased
approximately $180 million.
 
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.25% in 2017. Projected
returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and
investment management. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s 2018 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.25%,
consistent with 2017. The expected return
98

assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from
active investment management. The 2017 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 25% global
equities, 16% private equities, 41% fixed-income securities, and 18% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance
benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2017 was 12.4%.
In 2016 the plan earned a rate of return of 5.8% and in 2015 earned a return of 0.7%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets
over the past 10 and 25 years has been 7.0% and 9.4%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-
retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return
assumptions.
 
As of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scale it used
for calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of
this change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $820 million and the U.S.
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $100 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company updated the
mortality improvement scale to Scale MP-2016, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2016. The impact of this change
decreased the year-end 2016 U.S. pension PBO by approximately $440 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
by approximately $60 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company updated the mortality improvement scale to Scale MP-2017. The
update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.
 
During 2017, the Company contributed $964 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans.
During 2016, the Company contributed $380 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In
2018, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $300 million to $500 million of cash to its U.S. and international
retirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018. Future
contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.

Plan Asset Management
 
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the
trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its
primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present
and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the
potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments
to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.
 
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds.
However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate
amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
 
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 14 for
descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
 
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include
a target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and
illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long
periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for
tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable
ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately 46% of the postretirement benefit plan
assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same
investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.
 
The fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:

Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. Corporate debt includes
bonds and notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are
valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and
notes are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset
backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of
issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of
similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. 
 
Private
placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources. 
 
The private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Derivative investments
are written options that are valued by independent parties using market inputs and valuation models. Growth equity investments are valued
at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

Absolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles. Corporate debt
instruments are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under
a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for
certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risk ratings.
 
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include, interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for

International Pension Plans Assets
 
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories
is presented in aggregate for over 70 defined benefit plans in 26 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy
from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and
investment allocation process in each country. The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans
with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
 
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.

*In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a
practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned
by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian
of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts
presented in the fair value of plan assets.
 
Equities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are
valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and other debt) securities.
Governments, corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active
market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow
approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not
be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
 
Private equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate
Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.
 
Absolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and
other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using

cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist
of interest rate swaps that are used to help manage risks.
 
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable
for securities purchased and interest payable.
 
The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts
under the absolute return asset class. The aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains increased this balance by $48 million and $8
million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign currency exchange impacts increased this balance by $16 million in 2017 and decreased this
balance by $9 million in 2016.
 
 
NOTE 13.  Derivatives
 
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally
associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various
types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted
for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s financial position and performance.
 
Additional information with respect to the impacts on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is
included in Note 7. Additional information with respect to the fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 14. References to
information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also made in Note 11.
 
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income:
 
Cash Flow Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
 
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts:
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option
contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are
designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other
comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow
hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument
previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until
the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after dedesignation
are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of
time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.
 
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts:
 In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest
rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 500 million Euros as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with the forecasted issuance
of fixed rate debt. 3M terminated these interest rate swaps upon issuance of 750 million Euros aggregate principal amount of twelve-year
fixed rate notes in connection with 3M’s 1.250 billion Eurobond offering in November 2014. The termination resulted in an $8 million pre-
tax ($5 million after-tax) loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the twelve-year life of the notes.
 
In the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 2016 with an
aggregate notional amount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.
Upon issuance of medium-term notes in September 2016, 3M terminated these
105
 
Table of Contents
 
interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized
over the respective lives of the debt. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a
notional amount of $200 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.
 
In the first, second, and third quarters of 2017, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $200 million in each quarter as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.
Prior to the issuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an
immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
 
The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the  gain/(loss)
recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a balance of $112 million associated with the after tax net unrealized loss associated with cash
flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $8 million (after tax
loss) related to forward starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates
as of December 31, 2017, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $64 million, $30 million, and approximately $18 million of the after-tax
net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging losses to earnings in 2018, 2019, and after 2019, respectively (with the impact offset by
earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other
comprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the
forecasted transaction.

Fair Value Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
 
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps:
 The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help
manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at
specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts
106
 
Table of Contents
 
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or
losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense.
These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
 
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-
to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond
obligation.
 
In June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.
 
In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into
two interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450
million three-year fixed rate note, and the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an
interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted the
company’s fixed-rate medium-term note due 2020 into a floating-rate note as a hedge of its exposure to changes in the fair value that is
attributable to interest rate risk.
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as fair
value hedges and similar information relative to the hedged items are as follows:

Net Investment Hedges:
 
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments
to hedge portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are
designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or
losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The
remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in
cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged
foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment hedge
relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings
through their maturity date.
 
107
 
Table of Contents
 
3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by
time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or
are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange
risk coverage.
 
At December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was
approximately 150 million Euros and approximately 248 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal amount of long-term debt
instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 4.4 billion Euros. The maturity dates of these derivative and nonderivative
instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2018 to 2031.
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative and
nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. There were no reclassifications of the effective portion of net
investment hedges out of accumulated other comprehensive income into income for the periods presented in the table below.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were
designated in cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign
currency forward contracts to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany
licensing arrangements) and enters into commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain
commodities and precious metals. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and
losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

hedging instruments are as follows:

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments:
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company
actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks
and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit
risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity
and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2017, 3M has International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 17 applicable banks and financial institutions which contain netting provisions. In addition
to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has associated credit support agreements in
place with 16 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under which either party is
required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds or if a
counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of
these counterparties.
 
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis
even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the
following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted
in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the
counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the
reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not
eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash collateral had been received or pledged related to these
derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Effects
 
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately
$152 million in 2017 and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $69 million in 2016. These estimates include transaction gains and
losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
 
NOTE 14.  Fair Value Measurements
 
 
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard
also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants
would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset
or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other
than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:
 
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities
and certain derivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in
the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no
material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2017 and 2016.
 
112
 
Table of Contents
 
3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets
and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:
 
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for
these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from
large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm
to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding
certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 10.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:
 
3M holds municipal bonds with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal securities holding as of
December 31, 2017. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the financial health of the City of Nevada,
any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic considerations related to the direction of interest rates and the health of
the overall municipal bond market, and as such will be classified as a level 3 security.
 
Derivative instruments:
 
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair
value. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price
swaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use
foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820,
as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with
respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
 
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps
and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using
standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary
source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated
through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least
annually). Refer to Note 12.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:
 
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset
impairments. During 2017, the Company recognized approximately $61 million in long-lived asset impairments within its Electronics and
Energy and Industrial business segments, with the complete carrying amount of such assets written off and included in operating income
results. There were no material long-lived asset impairments for 2016 and 2015.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments,
accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these
instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in
the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes,
which are derived all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information with
respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount
of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and
by the designation of fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its
European subsidiaries. Many of 3M’s fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the low interest
rates and tightening of 3M’s credit spreads.

NOTE 15.  Commitments and Contingencies
 
 
Capital and Operating Leases:
 
Rental expense under operating leases was $343 million in 2017, $318 million in 2016 and $316 million in 2015. It is 3M’s practice to
secure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has two
primary capital leases. The first, which became effective in April 2003, involves a building in the United Kingdom (with a lease term of 22
years). During the second quarter of 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5 million British Pound
(GBP), or approximately $27 million at December 31, 2017, exchange rates. For the second, 3M sold and leased-back certain recently
constructed machinery and equipment in return for municipal bonds with the City of Nevada, Missouri. 3M recorded a capital lease asset
and obligation of approximately $13 million in 2017, $12 million in 2016, and $15 million in earlier years, with a lease term of 15 years.
 
Minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2017, were

Unconditional Purchase Obligations:
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-
cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment
(for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2017, at $800 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows:
2018 ($271 million), 2019 ($211 million), 2020 ($150 million), 2021 ($99 million), 2022 ($56 million) and after 2022 ($13 million). Many
of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are
sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The
purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the
Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to
purchases.
 
Warranties/Guarantees:
 
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are
estimated at approximately $50 million at December 31, 2017, and $47 million at December 31, 2016. 3M does not consider this amount to
be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
 
Related Party Activity:
 
3M does not have any material related party activity.

Legal Proceedings:
 
The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory
proceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and
sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental
proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
 
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings
 
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and
are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about
future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, 
Contingencies
,
and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss
and where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate
of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range
of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant
legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there
is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
 
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law
interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and
records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the
Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those
insured matters where the Company has not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not
estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of
insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.
 
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that
the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable
development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in
the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently
believes, except as described below, that such future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position of the Company. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and
associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable
and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current
estimates of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal
proceedings and claims pending against the Company could change in the future.
 
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities
and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that
purport to represent approximately 2,230 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,660 individual claimants with actions pending
at December 31, 2016.

Table of Contents
 
The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s
mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace
exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in
the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal
injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as
well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.
 
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The
Company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past.
Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater
percentage of total claims than in the past. The Company has prevailed in all twelve cases taken to trial, including ten of the eleven cases
tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2015, and the cases tried in 2016 and 2017–described below),
and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict adverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the
court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the court’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support
a jury verdict. In August 2016, 3M received a unanimous verdict in its favor from a jury in state court in Kentucky, in 3M’s first respirator
trial involving coal mine dust. The estate of the plaintiff alleged that the 3M 8710 respirator is defective and caused his death because it did
not protect him from harmful coal mine dust. The jury rejected plaintiff’s claim and returned a verdict finding no liability against 3M. The
verdict is final as the plaintiff did not file an appeal. In September 2017, 3M received a unanimous verdict in its favor from a jury in state
court in Kentucky in 3M’s second respirator trial involving coal mine dust. The jury ultimately determined that the plaintiff’s claims were
barred by the statute of limitations. In November 2017, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. The plaintiff did not file an
appeal, thereby ending the litigation.
 
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in
the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their
medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s
litigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons,
and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it
experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.
 
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two
other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in
2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly
incurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and
unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management
conference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages
proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for this matter because
the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible
loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in
this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on
the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
 
The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and
historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of
those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of
asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the
Company), (iii) the costs to defend and
118
 
Table of Contents
 
resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As part of
its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of
Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and
future claims. The Company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability.
 
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to,
significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix
of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii)
the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
 
As a result of the Company’s review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and as a result of the cost of resolving claims of persons who
claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, the Company increased its accruals in 2017 for respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities by $71 million. In 2017, the Company made payments for legal fees and settlements of $58 million related to the
respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities
(excluding Aearo accruals) of $608 million and $595 million, respectively. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of probable
loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company
cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has
established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in
which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged
are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability,
which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the
several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4
million. The Company is seeking coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are
resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies
 
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”).
Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain
respiratory protection products.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical
Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants,
including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek
damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other
occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.
 
As a result of the review of Aearo’s respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased Aearo’s accruals in 2017 for respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities by $13 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $30 million
for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. This accrual represents
the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Aearo
approaching the year 2050. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal
arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the
“Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the
“AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical
119
 
Table of Contents
 
Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an
agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly
fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving
exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a
particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out
of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in
place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos,
silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed
to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its
participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.
 
In March 2012, Cabot CSC Corporation and Cabot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Aearo in the Superior Court of Suffolk County,
Massachusetts seeking declaratory relief as to the scope of Cabot’s indemnity obligations under the July 11, 1995 agreement, including
whether Cabot has retained liability for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis claims, and seeking damages for breach of contract. In 2014, the
court granted Aearo’s motion for summary judgment on two claims, but declined to rule on two issues: the specific liability for certain
known coal mine dust lawsuits; and Cabot’s claim for allocation of liability between injuries allegedly caused by exposure to coal mine dust
and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to silica dust. Following additional discovery, the parties filed new motions for summary
judgment. In February 2016, the court ruled in favor of Aearo on these two remaining issues, and ordered that Cabot, and not Aearo, is
solely responsible for all liability for the coal mine dust lawsuits under the 1995 agreement. In May 2017, the Massachusetts Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial court order in favor of Aearo.
 
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to:
(i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant
changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate
outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation
among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage
limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is
inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo’s share of liability
for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for
existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.
 
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating
responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate
of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the
Company has established.
 
Environmental Matters and Litigation
 
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater
discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local
authorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain
circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for
personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in
complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in
light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and
regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its
operations worldwide.

Table of Contents
 
Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980 and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most
of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled “
Environmental Liabilities and
Insurance Receivables” 
that follows for information on the amount of the accrual.
 
Environmental Matters
 
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated
compounds, including perfluorooctanyl compounds such as perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”), perfluorooctane sulfonate (“PFOS”), or similar
compounds (“PFCs”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl
compounds. The company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the
phase-out announcement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its
ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering
the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to control or eliminate the presence of certain PFCs in
purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M’s fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.
 
Regulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international
bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As
the database of studies of both PFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the
available data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for
PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA
and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt
for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health
advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 70 ppt. Lifetime health advisories, while not enforceable, serve as guidance and are
benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in tap water from public utilities are safe for public consumption. In an effort to
collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances,
including six PFCs, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their
occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime health
advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July 2016 EPA
summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public
water supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the
period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the
sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public water supplies.
 
The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFC-
containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois
plants. As previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur,
Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant
sludge containing PFCs in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFCs in the soil,
ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the
manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues and is expected to
be completed in 2018.

The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed
May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFCs in the soil and groundwater at former disposal
sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove,
Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFCs from these sites and
proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based
Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of
Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFCs for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of
contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFCs at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate
PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued
formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In
August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.
During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury
sites. 3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the
Company and approved by the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an
operational maintenance mode. Remediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2018.
 
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing
facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting
of results.
 
In May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOS and PFOA. The new HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA and 27 ppt for PFOS. In connection
with its announcement, the MDH stated that “Drinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not
represent an immediate health risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on
multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” In
December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 2 ppb.
 
The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken
regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
 
Alabama Environmental Litigation
 
As previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama
(the “St. John case”), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and
property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The
court in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are
barred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s Workers Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in
November 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity
of the Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional defendants, including BFI Waste
Management Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur, Alabama; Morgan County,
Alabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities.
 
In 2005, the judge -- in a second purported class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated
compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds
from the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler case”) --
granted the Company’s motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in
the St. John case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage
on behalf of
122
 
Table of Contents
 
the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. No further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is lifted.
 
In February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the
“Stover case”) seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment
plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other
perfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS,
and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. In March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the case
transferred from Franklin County to Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County
Circuit Court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.
 
In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual complaint against 3M
Company, Dyneon, L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint also
includes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property
who use water provided by the Water Authority and five local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the
“Water Utilities”). The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’
chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River
at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the Water Authority. In
September 2016, the court granted 3M’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ trespass claims with prejudice, negligence claims for personal injuries,
and private nuisance claims, and denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ negligence claims for property damage, public nuisance,
abatement of nuisance, battery and wantonness.
 
In June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; and the Municipal Utilities Board
of Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in
connection with the disposal of certain PFCs through their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges
such practices may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered
and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested
relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.
 
In August 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water
Authority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama. Plaintiffs are residents of
Lawrence, Morgan and other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released
PFCs that contaminate the Tennessee River and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January
2017, the court in the St. John case, discussed above, stayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case.
 
In September 2016, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Gadsden, Alabama filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Etowah
County Alabama against 3M and various carpet manufacturers. The complaint alleges that PFCs from the defendants’ facilities
contaminated the Coosa River as its raw water source for drinking water and seeks unstated damages for the installation and operation of a
filtration system, expenses to monitor PFC levels, and lost profits and sales.
 
In January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties,
Alabama. The plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their water from the West Morgan-
East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass,
wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive relief and punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate
manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the
groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants
have discharged into Bakers Creek and the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in turn,
123
 
Table of Contents
 
discharges wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result the alleged discharges,
the water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level
dangerous to humans.
 
In May 2017, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the Town of Centre, Alabama filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cherokee County
Alabama against 3M, DuPont, and various carpet and textile manufacturers. The complaint alleges that PFCs from the defendants’ facilities
contaminated the town’s raw water source for drinking water and seeks unstated damages for the installation and operation of a filtration
system, expenses to monitor PFC levels, lost profits and sales, and injunctive relief.
 
In November 2017, a purported class action was filed against 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, Daikin America, and the West Morgan-East
Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs are
residents of Lawrence and Morgan County, Alabama who receive their water from the Water Authority. They assert various common law
claims, including negligence, nuisance, wantonness, and fraudulent concealment, and they seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees,
compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged personal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate
manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the
groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants
have discharged into the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in turn, discharges wastewater containing these
chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the Water Authority
to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans.
 
Minnesota Environmental Litigation
 
In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General Lori Swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the natural resources of
the State of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages (including unspecified assessment
costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State’s natural resources under the
Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as
statutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFCs in the groundwater,
surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also seeks declarations under MERLA that 3M is
responsible for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFCs into the environment,
and under MWPCA that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages. In
September 2017, the State’s damages expert submitted a report that contends the State incurred $5 billion in damages. In November 2017,
the State of Minnesota filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to seek punitive damages from 3M, and 3M filed a motion for
summary judgment contending, among other things, that the State’s claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. A hearing on
those motions was held in December 2017. In December 2017, the court urged the parties to attempt to resolve the litigation before trial, and
in January 2018, the court appointed a mediator to facilitate that process. If the parties are not able to resolve the matter, the trial is
scheduled to begin in February 2018. An adverse ruling or judgment, settlement, or unfavorable development in the NRD Lawsuit could
result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which
they are recorded and on the consolidated financial position of the Company. No liability has been recorded because the Company believes
any such liability is not probable and estimable.
 
In November 2011, the Metropolitan Council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the NRD Lawsuit seeking compensatory
damages and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for costs and fees that the Metropolitan
Council alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the MPCA imposes restrictions on Metropolitan Council’s PFOS
discharges to the Mississippi River, including the installation and maintenance of a water treatment system. The Metropolitan Council’s
intervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under MERLA for response
costs, and under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3M for PFOS and other PFC
pollution of the waters and sediments of the Mississippi River. 3M did not object to the motion to intervene. In January 2012, 3M answered
the Metropolitan Council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the Metropolitan Council
124
 
Table of Contents
 
discharges PFCs to the Mississippi River and discharges PFC-containing sludge and bio solids from one or more of its wastewater treatment
plants onto agricultural lands and local area landfills. Accordingly, 3M’s complaint against the Metropolitan Council asked that if the court
finds that the State is entitled to any of the damages it sought, 3M be awarded contribution and apportionment from the Metropolitan
Council, including attorneys’ fees, under MERLA, and contribution from and liability for the Metropolitan Council’s proportional share of
damages awarded to the State under the MWPCA, as well as under statutory nuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance, and
negligence. 3M also sought declaratory relief under MERA. In May 2017, the Metropolitan Council paid 3M approximately $1 million and
agreed to dismiss its claims against 3M. As part of the settlement agreement, 3M agreed to dismiss its claims against the Metropolitan
Council.
 
In April 2012, 3M filed a motion to disqualify the State of Minnesota’s counsel, Covington & Burling, LLP (Covington). In October 2012,
the court granted 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington as counsel to the State, and the State and Covington appealed the court’s
disqualification to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s
disqualification order. In October 2013, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted both the State’s and Covington’s petition for review of the
decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In April 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded
the case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court took evidence on the disqualification issues at a hearing in October
2015. In February 2016, the district court ruled that Covington violated the professional ethics rule against representing a client (here the
State of Minnesota) in the same or substantially related matter where that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of a
former client (3M). The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it further found that 3M impliedly
waived by delaying to assert the conflict. Other activity in the case, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the disqualification issue,
has resumed. Trial of the NRD Lawsuit is scheduled to begin in February 2018. In a separate but related action, the Company filed suit in
the Ramsey County District Court against Covington for breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company and for breach of contract arising out
of Covington’s representation of the State of Minnesota in the NRD Lawsuit. In September 2016, the court granted 3M’s motion for leave to
amend the complaint to plead punitive damages. In February 2017, Covington settled this lawsuit with a payment by Covington or its
insurer to 3M that is not material to 3M’s results of operations or financial condition.
 
In July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M alleging that the City
suffered damages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFCs, including costs to construct alternative sources of drinking water.
Trial is scheduled to begin in September 2019.
 
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Litigation
 
3M manufactured and marketed Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from
approximately 1963 to 2000. As of December 31, 2017, twelve purported class actions have been filed against 3M and other defendants in
various state and federal courts in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New York alleging that certain PFCs used in AFFF contaminated the soil
and groundwater where AFFF was used at current or former airports and air force military bases located in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and
New York. An individual complaint also has been filed in federal court Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that
contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values,
investigation costs, and remediation costs. Some cases seek funds for medical monitoring. Several companies have been sued along with
3M, including Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, National Foam, Inc., United
Technologies Corp
.
 
In November 2016, the Town of Barnstable, MA filed an individual action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages and other relief against 3M and other suppliers of AFFF for alleged contamination of
the aquifer supplying drinking water to the Hyannis water system. The town seeks to recover costs associated with the investigation,
treatment, remediation, and monitoring of drinking water supplies allegedly contaminated with certain PFCs used in AFFF. In January
2017, the County of Barnstable, MA, filed an individual action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking unstated
compensatory and punitive damages and other relief (including indemnification and contribution in connection with claims asserted against
the County by the Town of Barnstable) against 3M and other suppliers of AFFF for alleged contamination of the aquifer supplying drinking
water to the Hyannis water system.

In February 2017, husband and wife plaintiffs sued 3M and other defendants in federal court in Pennsylvania, alleging personal injury, loss
of consortium and companionship, and associated damages.
 
In March 2017, plaintiff residents of Suffolk County, Long Island filed a class action complaint in state court in Suffolk County New York,
naming the County and 3M and other alleged manufacturers of AFFF products. The action was removed to the Eastern District of New
York.
 
In August 2017, three class action complaints were filed in state court in New York against 3M and other defendants including the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. Plaintiffs allege PFC contamination of the local water supply linked to AFFF at Stewart Air
National Guard Base and Stewart International Airport. The Port Authority is the leaseholder of the airport. All three cases have classes for
diminution of property and medical monitoring. In September 2017, co-defendant Tyco removed all three cases to the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York.
 
In October 2017, a class action complaint was filed in Suffolk County, New York against 3M and others regarding PFCs allegedly released
at the Suffolk County Firematics Training Facility. In November 2017, co-defendant National Foam removed the case to the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York.
 
In December 2017, a complaint was filed by a group of 26 plaintiffs in Suffolk County, New York against 3M and others regarding PFCs
allegedly released at Gabreski Airport.
 
In December 2017, a complaint was filed by the Suffolk County Water District in December 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York against 3M and others regarding PFCs allegedly released at Gabreski Airport and Suffolk County Firematics Training
Facility.
 
Other Environmental Litigation
 
In September 2017, three complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against 3M, Saint-Gobain
Performance Plastics Corp. (“Saint-Gobain”), Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company.
Plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for manufacturing purposes at Saint-Gobain’s and Honeywell’s
facilities located in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick. Plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around Hoosick Falls
became contaminated with unsafe levels of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants, and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to
the ingestion and inhalation of PFOA. Plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’
fees and costs.
 
On December 1, 2017, eight plaintiffs filed a 12-count class action against 3M, Wolverine World Wide and Waste Management, Inc.,
alleging negligence, trespass, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, battery, products liability, public and private
nuisance, fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment. Each count was filed against each defendant. The action arises from Wolverine’s
allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes related to their shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M
Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M’s product have contaminated the environment after being disposed of
near drinking water sources.
 
For environmental litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the Company believes the
amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accrual is not material to the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. For those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the Company
believes any such liability is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.
 
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had recorded liabilities of $28 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon
an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also
126
 
Table of Contents
 
recorded related insurance receivables of $8 million. The Company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when
they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a
plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-
party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible
parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further
information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation
for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had recorded liabilities of $25 million for “other environmental liabilities” based upon an
evaluation of currently available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA, the remedial action
agreement with ADEM, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale,
Minnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage
Grove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that
most of the spending will occur over the next four years. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company collected from its insurer the
outstanding receivable of $15 million related to “other environmental liabilities.”
 
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative
cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in
the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental
regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies,
including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in
allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-
party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which
remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including
required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to
the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely
ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons
described above.
 
Other Matters
 
Department of Labor Investigation
 
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) notified 3M in April 2015 that it had commenced an investigation of 3M’s pension plan pursuant to
the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The DOL has stated its investigation relates to certain
private equity investments, plan expenses, securities lending, and distributions of plan benefits. In response to certain DOL requests, 3M
produced documents and made employees available for interviews. In December 2016, the DOL issued certain subpoenas to 3M and 3M
Investment Management Corp. relating to this investigation. 3M has produced additional responsive documents and is cooperating with the
DOL in its investigation. 3M anticipates that the DOL will conclude its investigation in the first half of 2018.
 
Product Liability Litigation
 
One customer obtained an order in the French courts against 3M Purification SAS (a French subsidiary) in October 2011 appointing an
expert to determine the amount of commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by allegedly defective 3M filters used in the
customer’s manufacturing process. An Austrian subsidiary of this same customer also filed a claim against 3M Austria GmbH (an Austrian
subsidiary) and 3M Purification SAS in the Austrian courts in September 2012 seeking damages for the same issue. The Company reached
an agreement in principle to settle those
127
 
Table of Contents
 
two cases and finalized the settlement during the second quarter of 2017. The amounts agreed to in each of these settlements were not
material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 4,270 plaintiffs (compared to
approximately 1,260 plaintiffs at December 31, 2016), most of which are pending in federal or state court in Minnesota, in which the
plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due
to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The complaints seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability,
negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent
misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices
and/or false advertising acts. One case, from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee is a putative nationwide class
action. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the plaintiffs’ motion to transfer and consolidate all cases pending
in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district proceeding during the pre-trial
phase of the litigation. The federal court has set a trial-ready date in May 2018 in one of the two federal court bellwether cases. At a joint
hearing before the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota State court, on the parties’ motion to exclude each other’s experts, and 3M’s
motion for summary judgment with respect to general causation, the federal court did not exclude the plaintiffs’ experts and denied 3M’s
motion for summary judgment on general causation. In January 2018, the state court, in hearing the same arguments, excluded plaintiffs’
experts and granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation, dismissing all 61 cases pending before the state court in
Minnesota.
 
In June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents
who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of
the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based
on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL. The Bair Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part of the 2010 acquisition of
Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature
in surgical settings. No liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and
estimable at this time.
 
In September 2011, 3M Oral Care launched Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM dental restorative material. The product was originally indicated for
inlay, onlay, veneer, and crown applications. In June 2015, 3M Oral Care voluntarily removed crown applications from the product’s
instructions for use, following reports from dentists of patients’ crowns debonding, requiring additional treatment. The product remains on
the market for other applications. 3M communicated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as regulators outside the United
States. 3M also informed customers and distributors of its action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds. As of
December 31, 2017, there is one lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota that names 29 plaintiffs and seeks
certification of a class of dentists in the United States and its territories, and alternatively seeks subclasses in 13 states. The complaint alleges
3M marketed and sold defective Lava Ultimate material used for dental crowns to dentists and, under various theories, seek monetary
damages (replacement costs and business reputation loss), punitive damages, disgorgement of profits, injunction from marketing and selling
Lava Ultimate for use in dental crowns, statutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount
recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to
estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.
 
NOTE 16.  Stock-Based Compensation
 
 
The 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 123,965,000 shares of 3M common stock
pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and
performance shares. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining total shares
128
 
Table of Contents
 
available for grant under the LTIP Program are 30,125,144, and there were approximately 7,500 participants with outstanding options,
restricted stock, or restricted stock units.
 
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the
performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees
uses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period
approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at
age 55 and after having completed ten years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the 2017 annual stock-based
compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.
 
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.
The Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the
issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial for disclosure purposes by the Company.
 
Beginning in 2016, as a result of the Company’s application of ASU No. 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting
, certain excess tax benefits at the time of exercise (for an option) or upon vesting (for restricted stock units) are recognized as
income tax benefits in the statement of income. These amounts totaled $228 million and $184 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and
are reflected in the “income tax benefits” line within the stock-based compensation table below.
 
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following
table. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material.

Stock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant. As of December 31, 2017,
there was $67 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense
is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 20 months. For options outstanding at December 31,
2017, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 70 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $3.834 billion. For options
exercisable at December 31, 2017, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 56 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was
$3.080 billion.
 
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $703 million, $608 million and $465 million,
respectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $585 million, $665 million and $501 million,
respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2017,
2016 and 2015 was $238 million, $224 million and $172 million, respectively.
 
The Company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the
Company has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends, and other factors, to satisfy
stock option exercise activity.
 
For annual options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the
assumptions that follow.

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2017 annual
grant date, the Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most recent one year volatility, the median of the
term of the expected life rolling volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility of 3M stock, and the implied
volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants.

As of December 31, 2017, there was $78 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted
stock and restricted stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 22
months. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $136 million, $149
million and $166 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted
stock and restricted stock units for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $45 million, $56 million and $62 million, respectively.
 
Restricted stock units granted generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents
equal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting
period, although no dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends
are paid out in cash at the vest date on restricted stock units, except for performance shares which do not earn dividends. Since the rights to
dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average restricted stock unit shares
outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
 
Performance Shares
 
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The
2017 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and
earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The
number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere
from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Non-
substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each
individual became a 3M executive. Prior to the 2016 performance share grant, performance shares did not accrue dividends during the
performance period. Therefore, the grant date fair value was determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net
present value of dividends during the performance period. The 2017 and 2016 performance share grants accrue dividends, therefore the
grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on
basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in
computation of diluted earnings per share.

NOTE 17.  Business Segments
 
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and
services. 3M manages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and
Consumer. 3M’s five business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative
products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at
cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers.
Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information
shown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are not allocated
to business segments.
 
132
 
Table of Contents
 
Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and
customers the Company made the following changes:
1.
Integrated the former Renewable Energy Division into existing divisions;
2.
Combined two divisions to form the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division; and
3.
Consolidated U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting
 
Integration of former Renewable Energy Division
·
The (i) solar and wind and (ii) energy product lines (along with certain technology previously included in Corporate and
Unallocated) of the former Renewable Energy Division (RED) were integrated into the existing Electrical Markets Division and
Electronics Materials Solutions Division, respectively, within the Electronics and Energy business segment. In addition, the
former RED’s window film product lines were moved into the Commercial Solutions Division within the Safety and Graphics
business segment. This change resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2016 of
$203 million and $38 million, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment. These decreases were offset by a $207 million
and $29 million increase in previously reported total year 2016 net sales and operating income, respectively, in the Safety and
Graphics business segment and a $4 million decrease and $9 million increase in previously reported net sales and operating
income, respectively, in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division
·
The former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division (both within the Industrial business
segment) were combined to create the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division. Because this realignment was within the
Industrial business segment, it had no impact on business segment reporting.
 
Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting
·
The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts to better serve customers.
As discussed further below, 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S.
sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity
(“sales district”) with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. Previously, a customer in the U.S. may have been aligned to
several sales districts associated with multiple divisions or segments based on the individual products the customer purchased
across 3M’s portfolio. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts therefore changed the
attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales
and operating income for total year 2016 increased $163 million and $36 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the
elimination of dual credit net sales and operating income amounts.
 
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.

Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses,
certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate
restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not
to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a
quarterly and annual basis.
 
3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income.
Management evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit U.S.
reporting to further incentivize U.S. sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the
customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect
134
 
Table of Contents
 
to the particular product sold to the external customer in the U.S. is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is
largely reflected at the division level. For example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety
and Graphics business segment; however, a sales district within the Industrial business segment provides the contact for sales of the product
to particular customers in the U.S. market. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also receive credit for the
associated net sales initiated though its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to
dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual
credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating
income for the U.S. in total are unchanged.
 
Certain sales and operating income results for electronic bonding product lines are equally divided between the Electronics and Energy
business segment and the Industrial business segment.
 
 
NOTE 18.  Geographic Areas
 
Geographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and
certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made.

Item 9A. 
Controls
 
 and Procedures.
 
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
 
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).
 Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 excluded Scott Safety, which was acquired by the Company in October 2017 in a
purchase business combination. Scott Safety is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales represented less than 1
percent of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Companies are
allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while
integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
 
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently
completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
 
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the
efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next
several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over
financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
 
The Company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited subsidiaries/locations and
will continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,
this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the
testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the
above paragraphs, that the implementation of ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial
reporting.

AMENDED AND RESTATED
3M EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE PLAN
 
1.         Purpose of the Plan
 
The purpose of the 3M Executive Life Insurance Plan is to provide those executive employees who participate in
the Plan with Company-funded insurance coverage during employment and with the opportunity to continue their
insurance coverage after retirement (at the individual’s expense) through 3M's obtaining one or more life
insurance policies on their behalf.  The Plan is designed to work together with 3M’s Basic Life Insurance Plan
and the additional coverage offered by the 3M Employees’ Benefits Trust Association to afford participating
executive employees the opportunity to obtain comprehensive death benefit protection for their families and
beneficiaries.
 
The actual amount of death benefit a Participant's Beneficiary may receive from the policies purchased pursuant
to this Plan will vary by such factors as the Insurance Carrier's policy dividend crediting rate, time of retirement,
and the manner in which the Participant elects to maintain the policy or policies after retirement, as well as other
factors.
 
This document reflects the provisions of the Plan as amended through November 11, 2007.  The initial effective
date of this Plan was October 1, 1993.

who is a current Employee. For a Participant who has retired from the Company but remains a Participant

effect immediately prior to the time of retirement. 
   
 
2.7       "Corporate Capital Interest" means the Insurance Policy's cumulative Annual Premiums paid by the
Company in respect of a Policy with respect to which the Participant has entered into a split dollar insurance
agreement with the Company, as set forth in Section 6.2. The Corporate Capital Interest shall be reduced by
policy loans, if any (including any unpaid interest thereon), taken by the Company.  The actual amount of
the Corporate Capital Interest shall be determined by the Company, and such determination shall be
binding upon the Insurance Carrier and any person having an ownership or beneficial interest in the
Insurance Policy.

any, issued by the Insurance Carrier pursuant to the Plan.  Except to the extent such defined terms are
inconsistent with defined terms under the Plan, insurance terms used herein shall have the same meaning as
in the Insurance Policy.
 
2.13     "Participant" means an Employee who has met and continues to meet all the applicable eligibility
requirements under the Plan.

Participant no longer meets all the applicable eligibility requirements under the Plan.
 
3.         Administration And Interpretation Of The Plan
 
3.1.      
Plan Administrator
.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall have control
over the administration and interpretation of the Plan, with all the powers necessary to carry out the intent
of the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may adopt such rules and regulations relating to the Plan as the Plan
Administrator deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.  Any decisions, actions or
interpretations of any provision of the Plan made by the Plan Administrator shall be made in its sole
discretion, need not be uniformly applied to similarly situated individuals, and shall be final, binding and
conclusive on all persons interested in the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may delegate administrative
responsibilities to advisors or other persons and may rely upon the information or opinions of legal counsel
or experts selected to render advice with respect to the Plan.
 
3.2.      
Insurance Carrier
.  The Insurance Carrier shall be responsible for all matters relating to any Insurance
Policy.  Not in limitation, but in amplification of the foregoing, the Insurance Carrier shall decide whether it
will issue an Insurance Policy on the life of a Participant who has otherwise met all of the Plan's eligibility
requirements.
 
3.3.      
Plan Document Shall Control
.  In the event of any discrepancy between any other documents,
communication pieces or plan summaries prepared pursuant to this Plan, other than the Insurance Policies,
the plan document shall control.
 
4.         Eligibility and Participation

d)         Sign all documents presented by the Plan Administrator necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of

3
 
 
 
 
 
Since participation under the Plan involves the purchase of an Insurance Policy, which is subject to the
Employee's insurability, the Company does not guarantee that each Employee nominated for participation will be
able to participate in the Plan.
 
5.         Death Benefits
 
5.1       
Amount of Benefits/Coverage
.  All of the benefits provided under this Plan shall be provided exclusively
through the Insurance Policies purchased upon the lives of the Participants.  While a Participant is
employed by the Company, the Insurance Policy or Policies purchased upon the life of such Participant will
be designed to provide a Participant Death Benefit equal to approximately three (3) times the Participant's
Compensation (or in the case of those Participants who are senior executives of the Company,
approximately four (4) times the Participant’s Compensation less the amount of additional life insurance
coverage available through the optional life insurance benefit plans offered by the 3M Employees’ Benefits
Trust Association, if such formula would produce a larger amount) less the amount of such Participant’s
coverage under the 3M Basic Life Insurance Plan; provided, however, that for a Participant who is not
covered by the 3M Basic Life Insurance Plan, their Insurance Policy or Policies shall be designed to
provide a Participant Death Benefit equal to approximately two (2) times the Participant’s
Compensation.  Following retirement from employment with the Company, the Insurance Policy or
Policies purchased upon the life of each Participant whose participation in this Plan began prior to
September 1, 2003 will be designed to provide a Participant Death Benefit equal to approximately one and
one-half (1.5) times the Participant’s Compensation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of a
Participant’s coverage under this Plan shall be frozen and shall not thereafter increase in the event such
Participant makes a withdrawal from one or more of the Insurance Policies purchased upon his or her life
pursuant to this Plan. 
 
5.2       
Offset against Death Benefit
.  If the Company has participated in the purchase of a single premium life
insurance policy for which the death benefits are payable to the Participant's Beneficiary, the amount of
available death proceeds under such policy will be used as an offset when determining the policy amount
under Section 5.1.
 
5.3       
Payment of Death Benefit
.  Subject to the Company's right to first recover its Corporate Capital Interest
with respect to such Policy or Policies (if applicable), the death benefit payable under the Plan following
the death of a Participant is the Participant Death Benefit payable under the Insurance Policy or Policies
insuring the life of such Participant. This Participant Death Benefit shall be determined and paid by the
Insurance Carrier from the proceeds of the Insurance Policy or Policies upon submission of acceptable
proof of death and a claim for benefits. The Participant Death Benefit payable to a Participant's Beneficiary
shall be in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Policy or Policies and the provisions of this Plan.
 
5.4       
No Guarantee of Death Benefit
.  In the event that the death proceeds payable under the Insurance Policy or
Policies insuring the life of a Participant exceeds the sum of the
4
 
 
 
 
 
Company's Corporate Capital Interest (if any) and the targeted Participant's Death Benefit under Section
5.1, the excess death proceeds shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary. In the event that the death
proceeds payable under the Insurance Policy or Policies insuring the life of a Participant are not sufficient
to provide the targeted Participant's Death Benefit under Section 5.1, the Company shall not be obligated to
make up or compensate the Participant’s Beneficiary for any deficiency.
 
5.5       
Beneficiary Designation
.  The Participant Death Benefit is payable to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
designated by the Participant or other owner of the Insurance Policy. If no such Beneficiary is designated,
the Beneficiary shall be the person or persons entitled to the death benefit under the terms of the Insurance
Policy or applicable state law, whichever governs.
 
5.6       
Ownership of Insurance Policies;Assignment
.  Effective January 1, 2008, each Insurance Policy purchased
under this Plan shall be a group term life insurance policy issued to the Company and/or the Plan. Insurance
Policies purchased under this Plan prior to January 1, 2008 were initially owned by the Participant whose
life was insured thereby. To secure the repayment of the Company’s Corporate Capital Interest (if
applicable), each Participant who has entered into a split dollar insurance agreement with the Company
shall assign such Policy to 3M as part of such Agreement. Subject to the terms of such Insurance Policy and
the Company’s rights pursuant to such assignment, each Participant shall have the right to assign any or all
of his or her interest in the Insurance Policy and the accompanying Agreement (if applicable) to any person,
entity, or trust, by signing and delivering to the Plan Administrator and the Insurance Carrier a written
Assignment in a form mutually acceptable to the Plan Administrator and the Insurance Carrier.
 
5.7       
Protective Provisions
.  If a Participant dies by suicide or if it is determined a material misstatement was
made in the Insurance Policy Application, the applicable protective provisions of the Insurance Policy will
apply.
 
6.         Contributions and Funding
 
6.1       
Responsibility of the Participant
. 
 
(a) With Split Dollar - Each Participant who has entered into a split dollar insurance agreement with
the Company shall be responsible for contributing the value of the “economic benefit" received as a result
of his/her participation in the Plan.  The value of the “economic benefit” received under an Insurance Policy
issued pursuant to this Plan will be based on the lower of the Internal Revenue Service’s Table 2001 rates or
the Insurance Carrier's published premium rates available to all standard risks for initial issue one-year term
insurance in compliance with Revenue Rulings 66-110 and 67-154 issued by the Internal Revenue
Service.  The Company will reimburse the Participant for this contribution, but not for the amount of any
income tax incurred by the Participant as a result of his or her participation in the Plan.  The Participant
shall be
5
 
 
 
 
 
responsible for all income taxes incurred as a result of his or her participation in the Plan.
 
(b) Without Split Dollar – Each other Participant shall be responsible only for paying the income
taxes incurred by such Participant as a result of his or her participation in the Plan. No portion of the
premiums payable on the Insurance Policy or Policies insuring the life of a Participant shall be payable by
the Participant while the Company is obligated to pay such premiums as described in Section 6.2 below.
 
6.2       
Responsibility of Company
.  The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all Annual Premiums
payable with respect to each Insurance Policy or Policies purchased under the Plan (a) for those Participants
who have entered into split dollar insurance agreements with the Company, while the respective Agreement
remains in effect, (b) for all other Participants whose participation in this Plan began prior to September 1,
2003, during their employment and for as long as necessary during their retirement, and (c) for Participants
whose participation in this Plan began on or after September 1, 2003, only during their employment. The
Company shall, at its option, have the authority to borrow against any Insurance Policy up to an amount not
to exceed the Corporate Capital Interest. However, the Company shall pay to the Insurance Carrier no fewer
than four Annual Premiums during the first seven policy years of each Insurance Policy, and during this
period the Company shall not borrow an amount greater than the sum of three years' payments described in
this Section. All interest payments due as a result of such borrowing shall be the responsibility of the
Company. The Company reserves the right to limit or adjust the amount of the premiums it will pay for an
Insurance Policy or Policies purchased under this Plan in the event that the Participant covered by such
Policy or Policies makes a withdrawal from one or more of such Insurance Policies.
 
6.3

.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Agreement (if any)
between the Company and each Participant shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the first of the
following events:
 
a)         The Insurance Policy's anniversary date on which the Participant attains Insurance Age 65, except
in certain circumstances where the Company in its sole discretion deems it appropriate to extend the
duration of funding in order to sustain the prescribed death benefit.  In no event may the Agreement
between the Company and a Participant be terminated as a result of the occurrence of an event
described in this Section 6.3(a) prior to the 15
 anniversary of the issue date of the Insurance Policy.
 
b)         The death of the Participant.
 
c)         The Termination of Service of a Participant for any reason other than the Participant’s death prior to

Insurance Policy its Corporate Capital Interest.  Upon the Company’s recovery of such Corporate Capital
Interest, the Participant or his or her assignee will be responsible for all future premiums and the Company
shall have no involvement whatsoever, direct or indirect, in such Insurance Policy.  The actual death benefit
provided by such Insurance Policy after such time may be greater than or less than the targeted death
benefits described in Section 5.1. In the event the Insurance Policy does not provide the targeted Participant
Death Benefit, the Company shall not be obligated to make up or compensate the Participant’s Beneficiary
for any deficiency.
 
In the event of a termination described in (b) above, the Company will be entitled to recover from the death
proceeds its Corporate Capital Interest and the balance of the death proceeds will be paid to the Beneficiary
under the Insurance Policy.  The actual death benefit provided by the Insurance Policy may be greater than
or less than the targeted death benefits described in Section 5.1. In the event the Insurance Policy does not
provide the targeted Participant Death Benefit, the Company shall not be obligated to make up or
compensate the Participant’s Beneficiary for any deficiency.
 
In the event of a termination described in (c) above, the Participant may maintain the Insurance Policy by
paying the Corporate Capital Interest to the Company in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.  Thereafter, the Company shall have no involvement whatsoever, direct or indirect, in the
Insurance Policy.  In the event the Participant decides not to maintain the Insurance Policy, he/she shall
execute any and all instruments that may be required to transfer ownership of the Insurance Policy to the
Company.  The Company shall have the right to maintain the Insurance Policy or dispose of the Insurance
Policy as it sees fit.  The provisions of Section 6.3(c) shall be subject to any applicable severance
agreement between the Company and the Participant.
 
7.         Amendment and Termination of The Plan
 
7.1       
Amendment
.  The Company may amend the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no amendment shall
adversely affect the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary acquired under the terms of the Plan as in effect
prior to the amendment without the prior written consent of the Participant or Beneficiary.
 
7.2       
Termination
.  The Company reserves the sole right to terminate the Plan at any time.  In the event of the
termination of the Plan, each Participant whose participation in the Plan began prior to January 1, 2008
shall be entitled to retain any Insurance Policy or Policies insuring him or her, reduced by the Corporate
Capital Interest (if any) as of the date of the termination of the Plan. Thereafter, the Participant will be

indirect, in such Insurance Policy or Policies.

the claim procedure established by the Insurance Carrier as the claim procedure for the Plan.  The Beneficiary of
the proceeds of an Insurance Policy must file a claim for benefits with the Insurance Carrier in whatever form the
Insurance Carrier may reasonably require.  If the Insurance Carrier denies the claim, the Beneficiary who wants
to have that denial reviewed will have to follow the Insurance Carrier's claims review procedure.  The Company
shall have no liability in the event an Insurance Carrier denies a Beneficiary's claim for benefits.
 
9.         Miscellaneous

ARTICLE I.
AWARD; VESTING; FORFEITURE AND SETTLEMENT
1.1        
Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents
.
(a)          This Award is expressed in terms of a Target Number of Performance Shares as set forth above (the “
Target
Number of Performance Shares
”).  The actual number of Performance Shares that may be earned will depend on Parcipant’s
connued service with the Company or any Subsidiary and the extent to which the performance goals established for the Award are
achieved.  Each Performance Share earned represents the right to receive one Share on the terms, and subject to the condions, set
forth in this Agreement.  Parcipant will have no right to the distribuon of any Shares unl the me (if ever) the Performance
Shares have vested.
(b)          The Company hereby grants to Parcipant, with respect to each Performance Share, a Dividend Equivalent
for ordinary cash dividends paid to substantially all holders of outstanding Shares with a record date after the Grant Date and prior to
the date the applicable Performance Share is se;led, forfeited or otherwise expires.  Each Dividend Equivalent entles Parcipant to
receive the equivalent value of any such ordinary cash dividends paid on a single Share.  The Company will establish a separate
Dividend Equivalent bookkeeping account (a “
Dividend Equivalent Account
”) for each Dividend Equivalent and credit the Dividend
Equivalent Account (without interest) on the applicable dividend payment date with the amount of any such cash paid.
1.2        
Vesting; Forfeiture
.
(a)          The Performance Shares will vest according to the vesng schedule set forth in the Vesng Appendix (the
“
Ves"ng Schedule
”).  Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator (or its delegate) or as provided for in the Plan or this
Agreement with respect to Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service prior to the last day of the Performance Period by reason of
Parcipant’s Rerement, death or Disability, the Performance Shares will immediately and automacally be cancelled and forfeited
as to any portion that is not vested as of Participant’s Termination of Service to the extent such Termination of Service occurs prior to
the last day of the Performance Period.  In addion, the Performance Shares will immediately and automacally be cancelled and
forfeited (including any poron that is then vested) upon the execuon of a wri;en determinaon by the Administrator or an
authorized representave of the Company that Parcipant engaged in an act of Misconduct (whether the execuon of such wri;en
determination occurs before or after Participant’s Termination of Service). 
(b)          Dividend Equivalents (including any Dividend Equivalent Account balance) will vest or be forfeited, as
applicable, upon the vesng or forfeiture of the Performance Share with respect to which the Dividend Equivalent (including the
Dividend Equivalent Account) relates.
1.3         
Special Vesting Provisions
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.2 or the Vesting Schedule, the
Performance Shares shall continue to vest, or vest on an accelerated basis, in the event of Participant’s Termination of Service prior
to the last day of the Performance Period under the following circumstances:
(a)          If Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service occurs prior to the last day of the Performance Period by reason of
Parcipant’s Rerement, the Performance Shares shall remain eligible to vest in accordance with the Vesng Schedule as if
Parcipant had not incurred a Terminaon of Service, subject to accelerated vesng pursuant to clause (c) of this Secon 1.3;
provided, however, that the Target
2
 
Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted, effective as of Participant’s Termination of Service, as follows:
(i)           If Parcipant was appointed to the Execuve Conference on or aAer January 1, 2006 and on or
before December 31, 2017, the Target Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted to equal the product of (A) the Target
Number of Performance Shares, as in eﬀect immediately prior to Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service, and (B) a fracon, the
numerator of which equals the number of whole calendar months Parcipant provided services to the Company or any
Subsidiary during the Performance Period and the denominator of which equals the total number of months in the
Performance Period; or
(ii)          If Parcipant was appointed to the Execuve Conference before January 1, 2006 or aAer
December 31, 2017, the Target Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted to equal the product of (A) the Target
Number of Performance Shares, as in eﬀect immediately prior to Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service, and (B) a fracon, the
numerator of which equals the number of consecuve three-month periods Parcipant provided services to the Company or
any Subsidiary during the first twelve months of the Performance Period and the denominator of which equals four.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment
and/or legal development in Parcipant’s jurisdicon that likely would result in the favorable Rerement treatment that otherwise
would apply to the Performance Shares pursuant to this Secon 1.3(a) being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the
Company will not apply this favorable Rerement treatment at the me of Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service and the Performance
Shares will be treated as they would under the rules that otherwise would have applied if Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service did not
qualify as a Retirement.
(b)          If Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service occurs by reason of Disability prior to the last day of the Performance
Period, the Performance Shares shall remain eligible to vest in accordance with the Vesng Schedule as if Parcipant had not
incurred a Termination of Service, subject to accelerated vesting pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 1.3.
(c)          If Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service occurs by reason of death or Parcipant dies following the date of
Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service by reason of Rerement or Disability, in each case prior to the last day of the Performance
Period, Parcipant shall vest in a number of Performance Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the Target Number of Performance Shares,
or (ii) such other number of Performance Shares determined by the Administrator, in its discretion.
For purposes of this Arcle I, the term “
Disability
” shall have the meaning given to such term in Treasury Regulaon secon
1.409A-3(i)(4).
1.4        
Settlement
.
(a)          Except as provided in Secon 1.4(c), all of Parcipant’s Performance Shares which are then vested, and any
related Dividend Equivalents (including any Dividend Equivalent Account balance), will be paid in Shares during the thirty (30)-day
period beginning with the earliest to occur of the following events:
(i)           the Cerﬁcaon Date (as deﬁned in the Vesng Appendix) (provided that in no event will Shares be
issued in settlement of Participant’s Performance Shares pursuant to this clause
3
 
 
(i) later than March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the completion of the Performance Period;
(ii)           the date of Participant’s death; or
(iii)          the date of Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service following a Change in Control of the Company
(provided that, if Parcipant is or will be eligible for Rerement at any me during the Performance Period, such Terminaon of
Service must constute a “separaon from service” from the Company (within the meaning of Secon 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code
and Treasury Regulaon Secon 1.409A-1(h)).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan, no
Performance Shares or Dividend Equivalents shall be distributed to Parcipant pursuant to this Secon 1.4(a)(iii) during the six-
month period following Parcipant’s separaon from service if the Company determines that distribung such Performance Shares
and Dividend Equivalents at the me or mes indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribuon under Secon 409A(a)
(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  If the distribuon of any of Parcipant’s Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents is delayed as a result of
the previous sentence, then such Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents (including any Dividend Equivalent Account balance)
shall be paid to Parcipant during the thirty (30)-day period beginning on the ﬁrst business day following the end of such six-month
period (or such earlier date upon which such Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents can be distributed under Secon 409A
without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Participant’s death).
(b)          The number of Shares paid with respect to the Dividend Equivalents will equal the quoent, rounded to the
nearest one-thousandth of a Share, of the Dividend Equivalent Account balance divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the
Certification Date.
(c)          If permi;ed by the Company and provided Parcipant makes a valid deferral elecon within the me period
speciﬁed by the Company in the deferral elecon form, then Parcipant may elect to change the ming of receipt of the Shares
otherwise distributable under Secon 1.4(a). Any such deferral elecon must comply with the requirements of Secon 409A of the
Code and the applicable Treasury Regulaons or other guidance issued thereunder as well as any Plan rules on deferrals and must be
made on a form approved by the Company. To the extent made, any such deferral elecon will be incorporated herein by this
reference.
(d)          Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the me of distribuon of the
Performance Shares and the Dividend Equivalents under this Agreement may not be changed except as may be permi;ed by the
Administrator in accordance with Section 409A and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
1.5        
Effect of Change in Control
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Vesting Schedule or Sections 1.2 and 1.3,
in the event of Participant’s Termination of Service prior to the last day of the Performance Period (i) by the Company or any
Subsidiary other than as a result of Participant’s Misconduct or (ii) by Participant for Good Reason, in either case, within eighteen
(18) months following a Change in Control of the Company, Participant shall vest in a number of Performance Shares equal to the
sum of:
(a)          With respect to any calendar year(s) during the Performance Period that have ended prior to the date of
such Terminaon of Service, the Vesng Eligible Shares for such calendar year(s) as determined pursuant to the Vesng Schedule;
plus
4
 
 
(b)          With respect to any calendar year(s) during the Performance Period that have not ended prior to the date of
such Terminaon of Service, the greatest of (i) the Performance Shares that would have been Vesng Eligible Shares for such
calendar year(s) if the Company’s performance relave to the performance objecves for such calendar year(s) equaled its actual
performance during those calendar quarters completed during the calendar year in which such Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service
occurs and prior to the date of such Terminaon of Service as set forth in the Vesng Schedule, (ii) the Performance Shares that
would have been Vesng Eligible Shares for such calendar year(s) if the Company’s performance relave to the performance
objecves for the such calendar year(s) equaled its actual performance for the three consecuve calendar year period ending
immediately prior to the calendar year in which the Terminaon of Service occurs, or (iii) such other number of Performance Shares
determined by the Administrator, in its discretion;
provided, however, that the resulng number of Performance Shares under this Secon 1.5 shall be prorated to reﬂect the number
of full calendar months during the Performance Period that elapsed prior to the date of Participant’s Termination of Service.
For purposes of this Secon 1.5, “
Good Reason
” means (i) a material diminuon in Parcipant’s posion, authority, dues or
responsibilies as in eﬀect immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company, (ii) a material diminuon in Parcipant’s base
salary or annual planned cash compensaon, or (iii) a material change in the geographic locaon at which Parcipant is required to
perform services for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Employer
”), the ulmate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe beneﬁt tax, payment on
account or other tax-related items related to Parcipant’s parcipaon in the Plan and legally applicable to Parcipant or deemed by
the Company or the Employer in its discreon to be an appropriate charge to Parcipant even if legally applicable to the Company or

of the grant or any aspect of the Performance Shares to reduce or eliminate Parcipant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve
any parcular tax result.  Further, if Parcipant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdicon, Parcipant
acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account
for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

(b)          Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable
, Parcipant agrees to assist the Company
and/or the Employer in sasfying any applicable withholding obligaons for Tax-Related Items.

has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon se;lement
of the Performance Shares, and that the broker has been directed to deliver promptly to the Company funds suﬃcient to
sasfy the obligaon for Tax-Related Items; provided that such amount is paid to the Company at such me as may be
required by the Company;
(iii)         To the extent permi;ed by the Administrator, surrendering Shares then issuable upon se;lement of
the Performance Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on such date; or
(iv)         By the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant.
(c)          The Company and/or the Employer has the right and opon, but not the obligaon, to treat Parcipant’s
failure to provide mely payment of any Tax-Related Items as Parcipant’s elecon to sasfy all or any poron of the Tax-Related
Items pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii) or (iv) above, or a combination of such sections.
(d)          Depending on the withholding method, the Company and/or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-
Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including
maximum applicable rates, in which case Parcipant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash through the
Employer’s normal payroll processes and will have no entlement to the Common Stock equivalent.  If the obligaon for Tax-Related
Items is sasﬁed by surrendering Shares, solely for tax purposes and not intended to modify or restrict in any way Secon 4.2 of the
Plan, Parcipant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance Share, notwithstanding
that a number of Shares are surrendered for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(e)          Participant understands and agrees that certain tax withholding amounts may be due prior to any issuance of
Shares under Secon 1.4 if the Performance Shares are at any me not subject to a substanal risk of forfeiture for purposes of
Secon 83 of the Code prior to such date.  If Shares are issued on an accelerated basis to sasfy the Federal Insurance Contribuons
Act tax imposed under Secons 3101, 3121(a) or 3121(v)(2) of the Code (the “
FICA Tax
”) as provided in this Secon 2.1(e) as a result
of the lapse of the substanal risk of forfeiture for purposes of Secon 83 of the Code prior to the issuance of Shares under Secon
1.4, then Parcipant may have income tax at source on wages imposed under Secon 3401 of the Code or the corresponding
withholding provisions of applicable state, local or foreign tax laws (together with the FICA Tax, the “
FICA-Related
Taxes
”).  Parcipant’s FICA-Related Taxes shall be sasﬁed by the deducon of such amount from other compensaon payable to
Participant.  To the extent the other compensation payable to Participant is determined by the Company to be insufficient
6
 
to sasfy Parcipant’s FICA-Related Taxes, Parcipant’s acceptance of the Performance Shares hereunder constutes Parcipant’s
instrucon and authorizaon to the Company to sasfy the FICA-Related Taxes through the accelerated issuance and withholding of
Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Performance Shares having a then-current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount
necessary to sasfy the FICA-Related Taxes of the Company and its aﬃliates based on the minimum applicable statutory withholding
rates. 
(f)          Finally, Parcipant agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the
Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Parcipant’s parcipaon in the Plan that cannot
be sasﬁed by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to honor the vesng of the Performance Shares and/or
refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of the Shares if Parcipant fails to comply with Parcipant’s
obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
ARTICLE III.
OTHER PROVISIONS
3.1         
Nature of Grant
.  In accepting the Performance Shares, Participant understands, acknowledges, and agrees that:
(a)          the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discreonary in nature and it may be modiﬁed,
amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time in accordance with its terms;
(b)          the grant of the Performance Shares is exceponal, voluntary and occasional and does not create any
contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Shares, or beneﬁts in lieu of Performance Shares, even if
Performance Shares have been granted in the past;
(c)          all decisions with respect to future Performance Share or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discreon of
the Administrator;
(d)          the Performance Share grant and parcipaon in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be
interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company, the Employer, or any other Subsidiary
and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate
Participant’s employment or service relationship (if any) at any time with or without cause;
(e)          Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(f)           the Performance Shares and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income from and value of same,
are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
(g)          the Performance Shares and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income from and value of same,
are not part of normal or expected compensaon for purposes of calculang any severance, resignaon, terminaon, redundancy,
dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or rerement beneﬁts, welfare beneﬁts or other similar
payments;
7
 
(h)          the future value of the Shares underlying the Performance Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be
predicted with certainty;
(i)           no claim or entlement to compensaon or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Shares
resulng from Parcipant’s Terminaon of Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach
of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or the terms of Participant’s employment agreement, if any);
(j)           for purposes of the Performance Shares, Terminaon of Service will be deemed to have occurred as of the
date Parcipant is no longer acvely providing services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such
terminaon and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdicon where Parcipant is
employed or the terms of Parcipant’s employment agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
or determined by the Administrator, Parcipant’s right to vest in the Performance Shares, if any, will terminate as of such date and
will not be extended by any noce period (e.g., Parcipant’s period of service would not include any contractual noce period or any
period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdicon where Parcipant is employed or the
terms of Parcipant’s employment agreement, if any); the Administrator shall have the exclusive discreon to determine when
Parcipant is no longer acvely providing services for purposes of the Performance Shares (including whether Parcipant may sll be
considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
(k)          unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Performance Shares and the Shares underlying the
Performance Shares, and the income and value of same, are not granted as consideraon for, or in connecon with, any services
Participant may provide as a director of a Subsidiary;
(l)           unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Administrator, the Performance Shares and the beneﬁts
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entlement to have the Performance Shares or any such beneﬁts transferred to, or
assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substuted for, in connecon with any corporate transacon
affecting the Common Stock;
(m)         the following provision shall not apply to Employees in the State of California: In consideraon of the grant
of the Performance Shares, and to the extent permi;ed by applicable law, Parcipant agrees not to instute any claim against the
Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary, to waive Parcipant’s ability, if any, to bring such claim, and release the Company,
the Employer and any other Subsidiary from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of
competent jurisdicon, then, by parcipang in the Plan, Parcipant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such
claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and
(n)          the following provisions apply if Participant is providing services outside the United States:
(i)           the Performance Shares and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same,
are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose; and
8
 
(ii)          neither the Company, the Employer nor any other Subsidiary shall be liable for any foreign exchange
rate ﬂuctuaon between Parcipant’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may aﬀect the value of the
Performance Shares or any amounts due to Parcipant pursuant to the vesng of the Performance Shares or the
subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon such vesting.
3.2         
No Advice Regarding Grant
.  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company
making recommendations regarding participation in the Plan, or Participant’s acquisition or sale of the underlying
Shares.  Participant understands and agrees that Participant should consult with Participant’s own personal tax, legal and financial
advisors regarding participation in the Plan before taking any action related to his or her Award(s).
3.3         
Data Privacy
.  Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in
electronic or other form, of Participant’s personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Performance Share grant
materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and its other Subsidiaries for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan.
Par"cipant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal informa"on about Par"cipant,
including, but not limited to, Par"cipant’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, passport,
social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the
Company, details of all stock op"ons, Performance Shares or any other en"tlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled,
exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Par"cipant’s favor (“Data”), for the purpose of implemen"ng, administering and
managing the Plan.
Par"cipant understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Investments, or such other stock plan service provider as
may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assis"ng the Company with the implementa"on, administra"on and
management of the Plan.  Par"cipant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or
elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have diﬀerent data privacy laws and protec"ons than
Par"cipant’s country.  Par"cipant understands that if Par"cipant resides outside the United States Par"cipant may request a list
with the names and addresses of any poten"al recipients of the Data by contac"ng Par"cipant’s local human resources
representa"ve.  Par"cipant authorizes the Company, Fidelity Investments and any other possible recipients which may assist the
Company (presently or in the future) with implemen"ng, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and
transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implemen"ng, administering and managing the Plan.  Par"cipant
understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Plan.  Par"cipant
understands that if Par"cipant resides outside the United States, Par"cipant may, at any "me, view Data, request informa"on
about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein,
in any case without cost, by contac"ng in wri"ng Par"cipant’s local human resources representa"ve.  Further, Par"cipant
understands that Par"cipant is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If Par"cipant does not consent, or if
Par"cipant later seeks to revoke Par"cipant’s consent, Par"cipant’s employment status or service with the Employer will not be
aﬀected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing Par"cipant’s consent is that the Company may not be able to grant
Performance Shares or other equity awards to Par"cipant or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, Par"cipant
understands that refusing or withdrawing Participant’s consent may affect Participant’s ability to
9
 
par"cipate in the Plan.  For more informa"on on the consequences of Par"cipant’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent,
Participant understands that Participant may contact Participant’s local human resources representative.
3.4        
Transferability
. The Performance Shares are not transferable, except by will or the laws of descent and distribuon or
as permitted by the Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
3.5        
Adjustments
.  Parcipant acknowledges that the Performance Shares, the Shares subject to the Performance Shares
and the Dividend Equivalents are subject to adjustment, modiﬁcaon and terminaon in certain events as provided in this
Agreement and the Plan.
3.6        
Defined Terms; Titles
.  Capitalized terms not deﬁned in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.
Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
3.7        
Conformity to Applicable Laws
.  Parcipant acknowledges that the Plan and this Agreement are intended to conform
to the extent necessary with all Applicable Laws and, to the extent Applicable Laws permit, will be deemed amended as necessary to
conform to Applicable Laws.
3.8        
Successors and Assigns
.  The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to single or mulple
assignees, and this Agreement will inure to the beneﬁt of the successors and assigns of the Company.  Subject to the transfer
provisions set forth in the Plan, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the beneﬁt of the heirs, legatees, legal
representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
3.9        
Enre Agreement and Imposion of Other Terms
.  The Plan, this Agreement (including all exhibits and appendices
hereto) and any valid deferral elecon made pursuant to Secon 1.4(c) constute the enre agreement of the pares and supersede
in their enrety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Parcipant with respect to the subject ma;er hereof.
Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Parcipant’s parcipaon in the Plan, on the
Performance Shares and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable
for legal or administrave reasons, and to require Parcipant to sign any addional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the
Plan will control.
3.10      
Severability
.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the provision will be severable
from, and the illegality or invalidity of the provision will not be construed to have any eﬀect on, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.
3.11      
Waiver
.  Parcipant acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by Parcipant or any
other person.
3.12      
Limitaon on Parcipant’s Rights
.  Parcipaon in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein
provided.  This Agreement creates a contractual arrangement between the Company and Parcipant only and shall not be construed
as creang a trust for the beneﬁt of Parcipant.  Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any
assets.  Parcipant will have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and
benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents, and rights no greater than the
10
 
right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents, as and
when settled pursuant to the terms hereof.
3.13      
Electronic Delivery and Acceptance
.  The Company may, in its sole discreon, decide to deliver any documents
related to current or future parcipaon in the Plan by electronic means.  Parcipant hereby consents to receive such documents by
electronic delivery and agrees to parcipate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the
Company or a third party designated by the Company.
3.14      
Language
.  Parcipant acknowledges that he or she is suﬃciently proﬁcient in English to understand the terms and
condions of this Agreement.  Furthermore, if Parcipant receives this Agreement or any other document relang to the Plan
translated into a language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is diﬀerent than the English version, the
English version will control.
3.15      
Foreign Asset/Account and Exchange Control and Tax Reporng
. Parcipant acknowledges that, depending on
Parcipant’s country, Parcipant may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporng requirements as a
result of the acquision, holding and/or transfer of Shares (including dividends received or the proceeds arising from the sale of
Shares) derived from parcipaon in the Plan, in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal enty located outside
Parcipant’s country.  The Applicable Laws of Parcipant’s country may require that Parcipant report such accounts, assets, the
balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transacons related thereto to the applicable authories in such country.  Parcipant
acknowledges that Parcipant is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control
and tax reporting requirements and should consult Participant’s personal legal advisor on these matters.
3.16      
Insider Trading Restricons/Market Abuse Laws
.  Parcipant acknowledges that, depending on Parcipant’s country,
or broker’s country, or the country in which the Shares are listed, Parcipant may be subject to insider trading restricons and/or
market abuse laws in applicable jurisdicons, which may aﬀect Parcipant’s ability to, directly or indirectly, accept, acquire, sell, or
a;empt to sell or otherwise dispose of Shares or rights to Shares under the Plan during such mes when Parcipant is considered to
have “inside informaon” regarding the Company (as deﬁned by the laws or regulaons in the applicable jurisdicons or
Parcipant’s country).  Local insider trading laws and regulaons may prohibit the cancellaon or amendment of orders placed by
Parcipant before possessing inside informaon.  Furthermore, Parcipant understands that he or she may be prohibited from (i)
disclosing the inside informaon to any third party, including fellow employees (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii)
“pping” third pares or causing them to otherwise buy or sell securies. Any restricons under these laws or regulaons are
separate from and in addion to any restricons that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the
Company.  Parcipant acknowledges that Parcipant is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable restricons and
should consult Participant’s personal legal advisor on these matters.
3.17      
Secon 409A
. The intent of the pares is that the payments and beneﬁts under this Agreement comply with or be
exempt from Secon 409A and the regulaons and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent
permi;ed, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith.  For purposes of Secon 409A, each payment that
Participant may be eligible to receive under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate and distinct payment.
11
 
3.18      
Appendices
.  Notwithstanding any provisions in this Performance Share Award Agreement, the Performance Shares
and Dividend Equivalents shall be subject to any special terms and condions set forth in the Vesng Appendix and the Global
Appendix.  Speciﬁcally, in the event Parcipant resides or relocates to one of the countries included in the Global Appendix, the
terms and condions for such country will apply to Parcipant to the extent the Company determines that the applicaon of such
terms and condions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrave reasons.  The Vesng Appendix and the Global Appendix
constitute a part of this Performance Share Award Agreement.
3.19      
Governing Law and Venue
.  This Agreement and the Performance Shares and the Dividend Equivalents will be
governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, disregarding the choice-of-law principles of the
State of Delaware and any other state requiring the applicaon of a jurisdicon’s laws other than the State of Delaware. For
purposes of ligang any dispute concerning the grant of the Performance Shares, the Dividend Equivalents or this Agreement,
Parcipant consents to the jurisdicon of the State of Minnesota and agrees that such ligaon shall be conducted exclusively in the
courts of Ramsey County, Minnesota, or the federal courts for the United States for the District of Minnesota, where this grant is
made and/or to be performed.

[Vesting terms to be determined at the time of grant.]
 
 
 
 
APPENDIX B (“GLOBAL APPENDIX”)
TO
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT
Certain capitalized terms used but not deﬁned in this Global Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Performance Share
Award Agreement (the “
Agreement
”) or, if not defined therein, the Plan.
Terms and Conditions
This Global Appendix includes addional terms and condions that govern the Performance Shares granted to Parcipant
under the Plan if Parcipant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below.  If Parcipant is a cizen or resident of a
country other than the one in which Parcipant resides and/or works, is considered a resident of another country for local law
purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries aAer the Grant Date, the Company shall determine, in its
sole discretion, to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall apply to Participant.
Notifications
This Global Appendix also includes informaon regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which Parcipant
should be aware with respect to Parcipant’s parcipaon in the Plan.  The informaon is based on the securies, exchange control
and other laws in eﬀect in the respecve countries as of November 2017.  Such laws are oAen complex and change frequently.  As a
result, the Company strongly recommends that Parcipant not rely on the informaon in this Global Appendix as the only source of
informaon relang to the consequences of Parcipant’s parcipaon in the Plan because the informaon may become out of date
in the future.
In addion, the informaon contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to Parcipant’s parcular situaon, and
the Company is not in a posion to assure Parcipant of any parcular result.  Accordingly, Parcipant is advised to seek appropriate
professional advice as to how the relevant laws in Participant’s country may apply to Participant’s situation. 
Finally, if Parcipant is a cizen or resident of a country other than the one in which Parcipant resides and/or works, is
considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency to another country aAer
the Grant Date, or, the information contained herein may not be applicable to Participant.
