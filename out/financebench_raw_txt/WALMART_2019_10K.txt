Development
of
Our
Company
Although Walmart was incorpor
ated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store inNewport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. 
Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In thatyear, the first Wal
-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, weopened our first Walma
rt Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expandedand, as of 
January 31, 2019 , our Walmart Intern ational segment conducted business in 26 countries.In 2000, we began our first eCommer
ce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007,leveraging our physical sto
res, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S.and formed a strategi
c alliance with JD.com in China. Since the jet.com purchase, we have continued to expand our U.S. eCommerce capabilities through acquisitions including Shoes.com, Moosejaw,Bonobos and other digital consumer b
rands. In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o  8, a technology incubator with a focus to drivecommerce forward. In f
iscal 2019, we acquired a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), an Indian-based eCommerc e marketplace , with an ecosystem that inc ludes eCommerceplatforms of Flipkart, Mynt
ra and Jabong. In the U.S., we added more grocery pickup and delivery locations and as of January 31, 2019, we offered grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations andgrocery delivery at ne
arly 800 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets. We are building an ecosystem with our omni-channelcapabilities, stores, s
ervices, eCommerce sites, supply chain and more than 2.2 million associates to better s erve our customers.Information
About
Our
Segments
We are engaged in global op
erations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan,Mexico and the United Kingdom, 
as well as Brazil prior  to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements. Our operations are conductedin three reportable s
egments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularlyreviews to analyze perfo
rmance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistentcontribution rate to th
e Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates. We sel
l similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.7

We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revisethe measurement of e
ach segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of asegment changes, previous per
iod amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In fiscal 2019, we revised certain of our corporate overhead allocations tothe operating segments and, 
accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability.Walmart
U.S.
Segment
Walmart U.S. is our largest s
egment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating underthe "Walmart" and "Wa
lmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com, jet.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $331.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 65% of our fiscal 
2019 consolidated net sales, and h ad net sales of $318.5 billion and $307.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Of our thre e segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had thehighest gross profit as a per
centage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.Omni-channel.
Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel exp erience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , through services such as "Wal mart Pickup," "Pickup Today", "GroceryPickup", "Grocery Delivery," and "Endless Aisl

Operations.
Many supercenters, discount sto res and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted.Seasonal
Aspects
of
Operations.
Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, itshighest sales volume and segm
ent operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.Competition.
Walmart U.S. competes with omn i-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets andsupercenter-type stores, a
s well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop, open and ope rate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determinesour competitive position wi
thin the retail industry. We employ many programs des igned to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:•
EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;•
EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and•
Omni-channel offerings such as Walmart Pickup, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Pickup Today, where a customer places an order online and picksit up for free from a s
tore; Grocery Delivery, where a customer places a grocery order online and has it delivered; or Grocery Pickup, where a customer places a grocery order online and picks itup at one of our participa
ting stores or remote locations.Distribution.
For fiscal 2019 , approximately 77% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of sto re merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout theU.S. The remaining store merch
andise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truckfleet; however, we contra
ct with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by anumber of methods from
 multiple locations including from our 33 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.Walmart
International
Segment
Walmart Interna
tional is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile,China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, 
as well as Brazil prior  to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements; and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (whi
ch includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America(which includes Costa Rica, El Salvado
r, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico.Walmart International includes n
umerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets,hypermarkets, warehouse clubs 
(including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites.9

Walmart International had net sales of $120.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 24% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and h ad net sales of $118.1 billion and $116.1 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 
, respectively. The segmen t's net sales have been negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S.primarily because of 
its merchandise mix.To deliver strong effic
ient growth, we have to be decisive when it comes to our capital and our time. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to reposition Walmart International, including:•
Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018 for $16 billion, or $13.8 billion net of cash acquired. We b egan consolidating Flipkart's results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019,using a one-month lag 
. The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.•
Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our wholly-owned United Kingdom retail subsidiary. Under the terms, we would receive approximately 42 percentof the share capital o
f the combined company and approximately £3.0 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, while retaining obligations under the Asda defined benefit pension plan 
. Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain and may take some time to complete, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal grouphas not been met as of January 31, 2019. Fur
ther, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future,if the held for sale c
lassification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capitalreceived and foreign ex
change rates.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018.  Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and weagreed to indemnify Advent fo
r certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters. We recorded a pre-tax ne t loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019 for the sale, of which $2.0 billion related to cumulat
ive foreign currency translation loss which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss.•
Consistent with our focus on core retail capabilities, the divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the proposed div estiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations 
, classified as held for s ale as of January 31, 2019 . Omni-channel.
Walmart International provides an omni-channel exp erience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , such as through services like "Cl ick & Collect" in the UnitedKingdom, our grocery pick-up and del
ivery business in several other markets, and our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India.Generally, retail uni
ts range in size from 1,500 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale sto res generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet. Other includ es stand-alonegas stations operating in th

The merchandising strat egy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand namemerchandise accounts fo
r a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.Along with the private brands we ma
rket globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside," and "Parent's Choice," our international markets havedeveloped market speci
fic brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Lider," "Myntra," "Jabong," "PhonePe," and "Extra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and localsuppliers in each marke
t to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Operations.
The hours of operation for oper ating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governinghours of operation. Operating uni
ts in each country accept a variety of payment methods.Seasonal
Aspects
of
Operations.
Walmart Interna tional's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourthquarter of our fiscal y
ear. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.Competition.
Walmart International competes wit h omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores,wholesale clubs, home-improv
ement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop, open and operate unit
s at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical par
t of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significantimpact on our competit
ive position in the markets where we operate.11

Distribution.

and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 83% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these dis
tribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We shipmerchandise purchased by cus
tomers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 90 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than1,900 eCommerce sort cente

Seasonal
Aspects
of
Operations.
Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a ce rtain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, itshighest sales volume and segm
ent operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.Competition.
Sam's Club competes with other me mbership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandisewholesalers and distributors, g
asoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandiseassortment, and bulk sizing to s
erve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.Distribution.
During fiscal 2019 , approximately 70% of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases we re shipped from Sam's Club's 23 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout theU.S., or from some of the Walma
rt U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's clubpurchases directly to Sam's Club 
locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its six dedicatedeCommerce fulfillment centers and
 other distribution centers, including two dedicated import facilities.The principal focus of Sam's Club's dis
tribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise while minimizing stored inventory. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments aredirectly transfer
red from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.Sam's Club uses a combination of our pr
ivate truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with commoncarriers to transpor
t perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.Intellectual
Property
We regard our tradem
arks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and withrespect to our associat
es, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights.We have registered, or 
applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and internationalpatent applications cov
ering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Suppliers
and
Supply
Chain
As a retailer and warehouse 
club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase themerchandise that we sel
l in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold,particularly products 
in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliersallows us to obtain favorable p
ricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws andother applicable laws. Our ab
ility to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through oursupply chain and to distribute 
those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to ourcustomers and members.
Employees

2019 , Walmart Inc. and our subsid iaries employed more than 2.2 million employees ("associates" ) worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally. Simi
lar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. A large number ofassociates turn over ea
ch year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology andtraining to associates.

o retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in theU.S. we offer a broad range of Company-pa

RISK
FACTORS The risks described below could m
aterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factorsthat apply to all compan
ies operating in the U.S. and globally.Strategic
Risks
General
or
macro-economi
c
factors,
both
domestically
and
internationally,
may
materially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance.General economic condit
ions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher pricesof petroleum products, inc
luding crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs ofessential services, such 
as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes inconsumer spending and shopping patte
rns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatorychanges, the imposition of t
ariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors inthe U.S. or in any of the other mark
ets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to onewith a lower average gross ma
rgin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, orotherwise material
ly adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.In addition, the economic 
factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and othereconomic factors in th
e U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affectour operations and operating 
results.The economic factors th
at affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in moreextreme cases, in ce
rtain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.We
face
strong
competition
fro
m
other
retailers
and
wholesale
club
operators
which
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance.Each of our segments compet
es for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and globaleCommerce and omni-channel
 retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.We compete in a vari
ety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,the shopping convenience and over
all shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandisepurchased through our digital p
latforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.15

A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See" 
Item 1. Business " above for additional discuss ion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.Certain segments of the r
etail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments aresubstantially reducing ope
rations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, orreduction in operation m
ay result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and otherimprovements in their 
competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidatedor aligned companies, 
which could adversely affect our financial performance.We
may
not
timely
identify
or
e
ffectively
respond
to
consumer
trends
or
preferences,
which
could
negatively
affect
our
relationship
with
our
customers,
demand
for
the
products
and
serviceswe
sell,
our
market
share
and
the
growth
of
our
business.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on howaccurately we predic
t consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products,customer experience, 
convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools andsocial media avail
able to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences andshopping patterns, or any other f
ailure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship withour customers, the demand fo
r the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.Failure
to
successfully
execute
our
o
mni-channel
strategy
and
the
cost
of
our
increasing
eCommerce
investments
may
materially
adversely
affect
our
market
position,
net
sales
and
financialperformance.
The retail business is rap
idly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurringthrough digital platfor
ms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.Our strategy, which includes acqu
isitions, joint ventures, investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow oureCommerce business, incre
ase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store andclub openings. The success of this st
rategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face asoutlined in this 
Item 1A . As a result, our market posit ion, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or otherlong-lived assets. In addit
ion, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities forcross-store or cross-clu
b sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.Furthermore, the cost of c
ertain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adverselyimpact our financial performance 
over the longer term.The
performance
of
strategic
al
liances
and
other
business
relationships
to
support
the
expansion
of
our
business
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance.We may enter into str
ategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements maynot generate the leve
l of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved inthe absence of such allia
nce. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Operational
Risks
Natural
disasters,
changes
in
climate,
and
geo-polit
ical
events
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance.The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms,droughts and tornadoes, whether as a 
result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a16

country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Such events could result in physic
al damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate workforce in a market, th
e inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores,clubs and distribution fac
ilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, thetemporary or long-ter
m disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distributionfacilities or stor
es within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption inour communications with our sto
res.We bear the risk of losses 
incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by suchevents. These events and thei
r impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Risks
associated
with
our
suppliers
could
materially
adverse
ly
affect
our
financial
performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. Weexpect our suppliers to comp
ly with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to findqualified suppliers who uphold our st
andards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside theU.S.
Political and economic in
stability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplierstandards (including our respons
ible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety andquality issues, disruption in th
e transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at whicha material amount of merchandise
 we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relatingto the suppliers and the count
ries in which they are located are beyond our control.In addition, the U.S. foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or ofgoods containing certain m
aterials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products couldadversely affect our financial 
performance.If
the
products
we
sell
are
not
safe
or
otherwis
e
fail
to
meet
our
customers'
expectations,
we
could
lose
customers,
incur
liability
for
any
injuries
suffered
by
customers
using
or
consuming
aproduct
we
sell
or
otherwise
experience
a
material
impact
to
our
brand,
reputation
and
financial
performance.
We
may
also
face
reputational
and
other
risks
related
to
third-party
sales
onour
digital
platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell couldcause customers to avoid pur
chasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.Any lost confidence on the part o
f our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety ofany food or non-food items we sell, 
regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms,which we refer to as marke
tplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, forthird-party sales of goods th
at are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent.We
rely
extensively
on
informat
ion
systems
to
process
transactions,
summarize
results
and
manage
our
business.
Disruptions
in
our
systems
could
harm
our
ability
to
conduct
our
operations.Given the number of individual 
transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject todamage or interruption 
from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches(through cyber-attacks 
from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors.Our information systems ar
e essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs andour online operations. Our infor
mation systems are not fully17

redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in ourbusiness operations in the int
erim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating ourinformation technology pro
cesses and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our informationsystems and processes, we may fa
il to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.If
the
technology-based
systems
that
give
our
custom
ers
the
ability
to

with
us
online
do
not
function
effectively,
our
operating
results,
as
well
as
our
ability
to
grow
our
eCommercebusiness
globally,
could
be
materially
adversely
af
fected.Increasingly, customers 
are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact withour customers and as a means 
to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today," "ClubPickup" and "Online Grocery" programs unde
r which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additionalcustomer traffic 
at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerceacquisitions) and in a numbe
r of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.We must anticipate 
and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building anddelivery of a seamless shopp
ing experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortmentof merchandise at comp
etitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platformmerchandising and rela
ted technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impacton the growth of our eCommerce busin
ess globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our digital platforms, which 
are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including thoseapplications and systems in ou
r acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplaceplatforms) or mobile 
commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may alsocreate denials of se
rvice or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we areunable to maintain the sec
urity of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration ofour competitive position 
and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness and results of operat
ions and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.Any
failure
to
maintain
the
security
of
the
information
relating
to
our
company,
customers,
members,
associates
and
vendors,
whether
as
a
result
of
cybersecurity
attacks
on
our
informationsystems
or
otherwise,
could
damage
our
reputation,
resul

in
litigation
or

actions
against

As do most retailers, we rec
eive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerningour associates and vendors. Some of 
that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, withoutlimitation, for enc
ryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we holdabout our customers, membe
rs, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, includinginformation permit
ting cashless payments.Cyber threats are rapid
ly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats andcyber-attackers c
an be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or small groups of "hackers." Each year, cyber-attackers make numerousattempts to access th
e information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacksmight defeat our or a th
ird-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.18

Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or theirinformation systems. Moreov
er, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or usedin a manner that could co
mpromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after thesecurity breach occurs.
Any breach of our security me
asures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply withapplicable privacy and 
information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data wascompromised and to restor
e their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws andregulations.
In addition, such events could be wid
ely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitiveposition particularly wi
th respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materiallyadversely affecting ou
r operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information aboutour operations and financi
al condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered byour insurance policies. Mor
eover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significantadditional resources to upg
rade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruptionof our operations, particu
larly our digital operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which mayhave information secur
ity risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as paymentnetwork security operating gu
idelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technologysystems are able to prev
ent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that anycyber-attack or incu
rsion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affectedby claims from custome
rs, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we aresubject under our contrac
ts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold iscompromised, which liabil
ities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could besignificant to us.
Changes
in
the
results
of
our
retail
pharmacy
business
could
adversely
af
fect
our
overall
results
of
operations,
cash
flows
and
liquidity.Walmart has reta
il pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receivepayment through established 
contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").Our retail pharmacy ope
rations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of ourpharmacy customers ac
ross drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule ofprescription drugs approved fo
r reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacynetwork arrangements oper
ated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrativeburdens associated with seeking 
third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost genericdrugs as substitutes for exist
ing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at ourpharmacies between brands 
and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increasedcompetition from othe
r retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customersto pay for drugs prescribed fo
r them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursementmay be subject; and changes 
in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or therepeal of
19

the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.If the supply of certain ph
armaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as wecould obtain a new supplier for su
ch pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptionsto other pharmacies.
One or a combination of such fa
ctors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the netsales and gross margin of those op
erations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
Our

qualified
associates,
increases
in
wage
and
benefit
costs,
changes
in

and
other
labor
issues
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs,including our ability to f
ind qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, isgenerally subject to num
erous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels withinthose markets, prevail
ing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, toattract or to retain qualified per
sonnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.In addition, if our costs of l
abor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase ourlabor costs, our fina
ncial performance could be materially adversely affected.Financial
Risks
Fluctuations
in
foreign
exchange
rates
may
mat
erially
adversely
affect
our
financial
performance
and
our
reported
results
of
operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to preparethose financial stat
ements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars usingexchange rates for the 
current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.As a result of such translat
ions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significantadverse period-over-pe
riod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without suchfluctuations in the currenc
y exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment andhave a corresponding adverse 
effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we mustacquire the currency 
to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwillingto change the prices at whi
ch we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates mayadversely affect our 
results of operations.Failure
to
meet
market
expe
ctations
for
our
financial
performance
could
adversely
affect
the
market
price
and
volatility
of
our
stock.We believe that the p
rice of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparablestore and club sales growth ra
tes, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend orstock repurchase program
s or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.20

ate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.During fiscal 2019
, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sal es. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods andservices from other coun
tries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include politicalconditions, including politi
cal instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions oneCommerce offerings in 
international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, locallabor laws, anti-money laund
ering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries orregions in which we operate, now or in th
e future.Our business and results of operat
ions in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations incurrency exchange rat
es resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and theEuropean Union put in alternat
ive trade and other arrangements.The economies of some of the 
countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affectour financial perfor
mance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and otheractivities of fore
ign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.Additional risks inherent in ou

ctual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may beexaggerated by the diff
iculty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws andregulations applicabl
e to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibitingsuch business practices and hav
e in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk thatone or more of our associat
es, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countriesmay be customary, will engag
e in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations,even if prohibited by our int
ernal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.Changes

tax
and
trade
laws

regulations
could

adversely
aff
ect
our
financial
performance.In fiscal 2019, our Walma
rt U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changesin trade policies, inc
luding tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potentialchanges which have been discussed in
clude the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the generalmerchandise we sell in our U.S. stor
es and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) andcause increases in the p
rices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.We are subject to inco
me taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provisionfor income taxes and curre
nt and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated injurisdictions that have 
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or bychanges in worldwide tax laws, regul
ations, or accounting principles.21

For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additionalguidance from the U.S. tax author
ity is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will betreated in accordan
ce with the relevant accounting guidance.In addition, we are subject 
to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations andlegislation. Althoug
h we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and maymaterially aff
ect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.Changes

We operate in complex 
regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including therelated interpretations and enf
orcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.Our pharmacy operations in th
e United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements.The regulations to which we are sub
ject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containingpseudoephedrine; applicab
le governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act, the Afford
able Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the managementand disposal of, hazardous substanc
es; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the"DEA"), trade regulations includ
ing those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well asstate regulatory authorities,
 governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal andstate laws governing health 
care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.For example, in the United Stat
es the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold validDEA and state-level licens
es, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing,disposal and holding of controll
ed substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significantcriminal, civil and 
administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.We are also governed by for
eign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employmentopportunity, employee benef
it and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacyoperations outside of the Unit
ed States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements,including those intended to he
lp detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes inenforcement practices or regulator
y scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may requireextensive system and 
operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products orservices we offer.
Untimely compliance or non
compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of ourbusinesses, including: suspension of pay
ments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs,including the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal orregulatory requirem
ents in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverseeffect on our business opera
tions, financial condition and results of operations.We
are
subject
to
certain
lega
l
proceedings
that
may
materially
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations,
financial
condition
and
liquidity.We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-actionallegations in which the pl
aintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have broughtclaims under federa
l and state consumer laws.22

In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous "equal value" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal(the "Employment Tribunal"
) in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is ofequal value in terms of, 
among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between thesedifferent job positions is no
t objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on aprospective basis. At present, we 
cannot predict the numbe r of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters . In December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,healthcare providers, Na
tive American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigationis entitled 
In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court fo r the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some ofthe cases included in t
his multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.Plaintiffs are seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannotreasonably estimate 
any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims.We discuss these cases and oth
er litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial St atements ," which are part of this Annual Report on For
m 10-K.We

be
subject
to
liability,
penalties
and
other
sanc
tions
and
other
adverse
consequences
arising
out
of
our
on-going
FCPA
matter.As previously disclosed, we are under 
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. We have been cooperating with those agenciesand discussions have been ongoing with the
m regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018, we reasonably estimated a probable loss andrecorded an aggregate 
accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the "Accrual").A number of federal and loc
al government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters.  Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits rel
ating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain ofWalmex's former officers.  T
hese matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements.We could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject ofsome or all of the on-going gove
rnment investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief,criminal convictions 
and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that therewill be ongoing media and governm
ental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as acorporate citizen. Mo
reover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information inconnection with the governmen
t investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations.While we have made an Accru
al for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we donot presently believe that
 these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,results of operations or c
ash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows in the 
future.ITEM

CERTAIN
OTHER
PROCEEDINGS:
The Company is a defendant in a l awsuit in which the complaint closely tracks the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times(the "Times") on April 21, 2012. This is a s
ecurities lawsuit, City of Pontiac General Employees Re tirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States Distric
t Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (
the"FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Se
ctions 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiffseeks to represent a cl
ass of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and has sought damages and other relief based on allegationsthat the defendants' conduc
t affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition toappeal the class cer
tification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. OnOctober 26, 2018, the parties fi
led a motion asking the court to approve a proposed settlement under which the Company would pay $160 million (the “Settlement Amount”) to resolve the claims of allclass members. On December 6, 2018, 
the court preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled the final approval hearing for April 4, 2019. The settlement does not include or constitute anadmission, concession, or finding o
f any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. The Settlement Amount was expensed in the Company’s fiscal 2019 financial statements.Securities

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS:
Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires dis closure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.For the matters listed b
elow, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will bematerial to the Company's 
financial condition or results of operations.In September 2018, the United Stat
es Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreementand Final Order. The letter 
accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March 1, 2017through June 23, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. Th
e manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. TheCompany is cooperating with the EPA.
In January 2018, the Environmenta
l Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of anEnvironmental Impact Autho
rization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine.26

In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the "ARB") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of smallcontainers of automotiv
e refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and hassought reimbursement. The Company h
as denied any wrongdoing.In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corpo
racion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty ofapproximately $380,000 in connec
tion with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from theMunicipality and the Secr
etaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.ITEM

This discussion, which presents our resu
lts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 ") and January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 ") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Finan
cial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financialstatements, the changes i
n certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics thatmanagement uses to assess th
e Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding ofhow each of those segments and its 
results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Management measures th
e results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, werevise the measurem
ent of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of i
ts corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . Management also measur
es the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in salesfor such stores and clubs, includ
ing eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores andclubs open for the previous 12 months, 
including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all salesinitiated online or though 
mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded fromcomparable sales when the 
conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisit
ions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method ofcalculating comparable sales varie
s across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.In discussing our operating resu
lts, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not theU.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countr
ies experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated usingthe current period's cur
rency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitionsuntil owned for 12 months. 
Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impactthe results, including net s
ales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.Our business is seasonal to a cer
tain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income haveoccurred in the fisca
l quarter ending January 31 . We made certain st
rategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business , which include the following: •
Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 pe rcent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018. The ongoing operations negative ly impactedfiscal 2019 net income and 
this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.•
Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), where we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company, however, the heldfor sale criteri
a has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will beconsummated. In the futur
e, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in thevalue of share capita
l received and foreign exchange rates.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019.•
Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019.30

The Retail IndustryWe operate in the highly 
competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialtystores, warehouse clubs and superm
arkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel oreCommerce presence. W
e also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number offactors including, but not l
imited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost ofgoods, currency exchange rat
e fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, theimposition of tariffs, 
cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in itssecurities can be found he

Performance
Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthenour competitive positions 
in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•
strong, efficient growth;•
consistent operating discipline; and•
strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financia
l framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.Strong,
Efficient
Growth
Our objective of priorit
izing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growthand expansion of omni-channel 
initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.Comparable sales is a me
tric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular periodover the corresponding period 
in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retailindustry, we provide comparabl
e sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparablesales calculated using o
ur fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.Calendar comparable sa
les, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , were as follows:

5.4% and 2.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club fisc al 2019 comparable sales were d riven by strong traffic, which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to ourexisting clubs and fuel sal
es. These increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019 . Sam's Club fiscal 2018 comp sales were driven by strong tr
affic and fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 31

Consistent
Operating
DisciplineWe operate with discipl
ine by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology andprocess improvements to in
crease productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate thanoperating, selling, gener
al and administrative expenses.

Strategic
Capital
Allocation
We are allocating 
more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with ourinitiatives of improv
ing our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omni-channel experie nce for our customers . Total fiscal 2019 capit al expenditures increased slightly compared to theprior year; the following

As we execute our financial 
framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics.We also provide returns in 
the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most d
irectly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as met
rics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to sharewith investors because it he
lps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives withpossible short-term imp
acts. ROA was 3.4% and 5.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For fisca l 2019 , the decline in ROA was primarily du e to the decrease inconsolidated net income 
resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and also the $2.8 billion net unrealized loss on our JD.com investment. Forfiscal 
2018 , the decline in ROA was primarily du e to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income. ROI was 14.2% for fiscal 2019 , which was flat compared to f iscal 2018 . 32

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capitalduring that period. We consid
er average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less averageaccounts payable and aver
age accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the mostdirectly comparabl
e GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation ofROI. In addition, we include a fac
tor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measurecomputed in accordance wi
th generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the perioddivided by average total 
assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulateddepreciation and amortization,
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROImore accurately m
easures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.Although ROI is a standard financia
l measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methodsused by other companies to ca
lculate their ROI. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our cal culation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor  of 8 for rent expensewith US GAAP operating lease assets.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a r
econciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, howeve r, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, isan important financi
al measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as ameasure of our perform
ance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including n et cash providedby operating activiti
es, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of$27.8 billion 
, $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We gene rated free cash flow of $17.4 billion , $18.3 billion and $21.1 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash prov
ided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to f iscal 2018 primarily due to tim ing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainlyresulting from U.S. tax refor
m enacted on December 22, 2017 ("Tax Reform") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to f iscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in n
et cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures . The decrease in net cash p rovided by operating activities and free cash flow infiscal 
2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to th e timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from theapplication of tax regu
lations adopted in fiscal 2017.Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the paymentsrequired for debt servi
ce and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that providessupplemental informa
tion to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . 33

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cashflow may differ from th
e methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure mostdirectly comparabl
e to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

ets and net salesfrom Flipkart, which we acquir
ed in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 , the increase in net sa les was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closuresin the Sam's Club segment during fis
cal 2018 , a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake i n Walmart Brazil in the International s egment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from 
fluctuations in curren cy exchange rates . For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generatedfrom eCommerce acquis
itions. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses 
and the $0.5 billion of negativ e impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Our gross profit rate decr
eased 18 and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects fromour growing eCommerce business, the 
consolidation of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was prima rily due to our plannedpricing strategy and the 
mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.Membership and other i
ncome decreased for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, primarily due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia in ourInternational Segment. Mem
bership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale ofSuburbia, along with a $47 million ga
in from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club,these gains were offset by ga
ins recognized in fiscal 2017 . For fiscal 
2019 , operating expenses as a per centage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leveragewere 
strong sales performanc e in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fisc al 2019 were partiallyoffset by additional inves
tments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class ac tion lawsuit . For fiscal 2018, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense managementhad a positive impact on our op
erating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures anddiscontinued real esta
te projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPAmatter, a charge of $244 
million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerceoperations.
Other losses were 
$8.4 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily the result of t he $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion pre-tax decrease in the marketvalue of our investment in JD.co
m. Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extingu ishment of debt of  $3.1 billion . Our effective income 
tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , 30.4% for fiscal 2018 , and 30.3% for fiscal 2017 . Although the U.S. statutory rate was lower ed due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the"Tax Act"), our effective 
income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recog nized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results.Additionally, our effect
ive income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomesof administrative aud
its, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal2019, are generally higher 
than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in Note 9 in the " Notes to Consolidated Financial Stat
ements ." As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, we reported $7.2 billion and $10.5 billion of consolidated net incom e for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which repr esents a decrease of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion 
for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $2.26 , $3.28 and $4.38 for fiscal 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 34

, the increase was prima rily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases werepartially offset by a $ 
3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake i n Walmart Brazil , a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in curren cy exchange rates , the continued wind down of our first party Brazil

e decreased  22.4%  and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 and  2018 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 mill
ion gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million ga in from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in f
iscal 2017 , which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . 35

Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. The decrease in operating expensesas a percentage of segment
 net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impa irment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exitcertain properties 
and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019 . While fiscal 
2018 was benefited by an increas e in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges fromdecisions to exit cert

t decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primari
ly due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 , as well as reduced tobacco s ales due to our decision to remove tobaccofrom certain loca
tions. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's ClubeCommerce sales positiv
ely contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 . Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset the decreases i n net sales for fiscal 2019 . For fiscal 2018 
, the increase in net sa les was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices. Sam's Club eCommercesales positively contrib

s relatively flat for fiscal 2019 and decreased 44 basis points fo r fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benef ited by lappingthe impact of markdowns to l
iquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sa les in fiscal 2019 , which have lower margins. This bene fit to the gross profit rate wasoffset by higher transport
ation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross prof it rate was primarily due to theimpact of markdowns to liquid
ate inventory related to club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, increased shrink, increased eCommerceshipping costs and the investmen
t in cash rewards.Membership and other incom
e increased 2.6% and 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an in crease of 1.5%in membership income r
esulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previousfiscal year. For fiscal 
2018 , the increase in memb ership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership incomeresulting from incre
ased Plus Member penetration.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales decreased 99 basis points for fiscal 2019 and increased 83 basis points fo r fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal2019 
, the decrease in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closuresand discontinued real est
ate projects. This charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018 . 36

As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $605 million for fiscal 2019 and decreased $713 million f or fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year.Liquidity

Liquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt andshort-term borrowings, have be
en sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remainingavailable cash flow has be
en used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our globalinvestment and expansion ac

e previous fiscal year primarily due to tim ing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments. The decrease in net cash p
rovided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previousyear's improvements in working 
capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were 
$7.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capi tal deficit was $15.6 billion and $18.9 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 
, respectively. We gene rally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to ourshareholders in the form o
f payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assetsas a result of the consolid
ation of Flipkart.Historically, we have used int
ercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to theU.S. 
$5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of app roximately $40 million . As of 
January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion 
as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through div idends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders;however, this cash is expected 
to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

ent $20 billion share repurchase progra m approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can makeshare repurchases. 
As of  January 31, 2019 , authorization for  $11.3 billion   of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired andreturned to an unissued status.
We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,cost of borrowings, our results of ope
rations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate tha t a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's freecash flow.

We believe cash flows fro

tories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.We have strong commerc
ial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As ofJanuary 31, 2019 
, the ratings assigned to our co mmercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:Rating
agency
  Commercial
paper   Long-term
debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predictwhether our current cred
it ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment,conditions in the retai
l industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agencycould increase our futur
e borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term creditratings could impair our
 ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensivetypes of debt financing. The c
redit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by the assigning rat
ing organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.39

(3)
Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases wi th initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . Under the terms of the sal
e of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Br
azilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2019 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.8 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Additionally, we have 
$15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the curr
ent liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Estimated interest p
ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2019 , and assumes interest ra tes remain at current levels for our variablerate debt.
Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition andlicense commitmen
ts and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that areenforceable and lega
lly binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing ofthe transaction. Contrac
ts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, areexcluded from the tabl
e above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Ourpurchase orders are based on ou
r current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations underthese contracts are not si
gnificant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goodsor services or changes to ag
reed-upon amounts for some obligations.In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $1.3 billion of unrecognized tax benef its are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, ifany, associated with these l
iabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.Off

of
Critical
Accounting
Estimates
Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.In preparing the Company's Consolidat
ed Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgmentsthat affect our fin
ancial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actualresults may differ f
rom our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accountingestimates and how the
y are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for Walmart U.S. segment'sinventories. The inventory a
t the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation,and these estimates a
re adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As ameasure of sensitivity, 
a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , our inventories valued at L IFOapproximated those invento
ries as if they were valued at FIFO.Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-liv
ed assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding theexistence of impair
ment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which isgenerally at the indiv
idual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accountingestimates may change 
from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result inmanagement determ
ining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the saleof the majority stake in Walmart
 Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019impairment would not change 
materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were$1.4 billion, these charges 
primarily related to restructuring  activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related t
o restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material.41

Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe account for business comb
inations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amountsattributable to noncontrolli
ng interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and theuse of valuation techniques when 
market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuingcertain intangible 
assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values ofidentifiable assets 
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Goodwill is assigned to the report
ing unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components havesimilar economic characteristics. 
As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted o f Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangibleassets are not amortized, 
but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluationbegins with a qualitati
ve assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair valueof the reporting unit is mo
re likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitativeimpairment test would be p
erformed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. Theseevaluations are based on de
termining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reportingunits and other indefinit
e-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature ofthe factors used in the
se tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-livedintangible assets, the fair
 value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for incometaxes requires signifi
cant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in ourassessment of certain 
tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earningsamong our U.S. and international ope
rations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statementsonly after determin
ing a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess theseprobabilities and reco
rd any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required tomeet before being re
cognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductibleand taxable items.
Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting andtax bases of assets and liab
ilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to theextent that a portion is no
t more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recentcumulative earnings, expectati
ons of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated byassessing the adequac
y of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Thisevaluation relies he
avily on estimates.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e "Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reducedthe U.S. statutory tax rate f
rom 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, wecompleted our accounting 
for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resultingchanges to our estimates wi
ll be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.42

ABOUT
MARKET
RISKMarket
Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment inJD.com.
The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future marketchanges. The effect of a 
change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which maymagnify or negate other s
ensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debtand by entering into inter
est rate swaps. For fiscal 2019 , the net fair value of ou r interest rate swaps increased   $13 million primarily due to fluctuation s in market interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by ex
pected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unlessotherwise noted. The notional a
mounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as ofJanuary 31, 2019

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives c lassified as fair value hedges.As of 
January 31, 2019 , our variable rate bor rowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-ter m and long-term debt. Based onJanuary 31, 2019 
debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $110 million . Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctu
ations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. Forfiscal 
2019 , movements in currency ex change rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the UK, Chile, and Canada were the primary cause ofthe  
$2.1 billion loss in the currency trans lation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.We hedge a portion of our for
eign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of $62 million and $413 million as of January 31, 2019 and 
January 31, 2018 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to othercurrencies in fiscal 
2019 . A hypothetical 10% change in th e currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value ofthe swaps of 
$515 million . A hypothetical 10% change in in terest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of theswaps of 
$13 million . 43

In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain ofour foreign operations. We h
ad outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge o f our net investment in the United Kingdom. As ofJanuary 31, 2019 
, a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-t
erm debt of ¥180 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge o f our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% change in v
alue of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.Investment Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
the JD.com ("JD") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. Since February 1, 2018, when we adopted the new financial instrument accounting standard, thechange in fair value r
ecorded within other gains and losses resulted in a loss of $3.5 billion due to a decrease in the s tock price of JD. As of January 31, 2019 , the fair value of our equ ity investment inJD was 
$3.6 billion . 44

We have audited Walmart Inc.'
s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accomp
anying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting didnot include the interna
l controls of Flipkart Private Limited (“Flipkart”), except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management’s assessment. Flipkart is includedin the 2019 consolidated finan

Definition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control
over
Financia
l
ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements forexternal purposes in acco
rdance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to themaintenance of records that,
 in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions arerecorded as necessary to
 permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of the c
ompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent
 limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject tothe risk that controls m
ay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Summary
of
Significant
Accounting
Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Wa
lmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and througheCommerce. 
Through innovation, the Company is striv ing to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering thatsaves time for its custo
mers. Each week, the Company serves over 275 million customers who visit its more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerc e websites under 58 banners in 27 countries.The Company's operations comprise 
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 ") and January 31, 2017 
("fiscal 2017 "). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined thatthe Company is the primary ben
eficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equitymethod. These variable in
terest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operationsgenerally using a one-month 
lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2019 related to the opera tions consolidated using a lag thatmaterially affected the Consoli
dated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amount
s of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements andthe reported amounts of r
evenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers inve
stments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less thanseven
 days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4  billion and $1.6 billion as  of January 31, 2019 
and 2018 , respectively. The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 
were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equ ivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, theCompany repatriated to th
e U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of app roximately $40 million . As of 
January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.Of the  
$2.8 billion  as of  January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through div idends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited("Flipkart") minority sha
reholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.Restricted Cash
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Statement of Cash Flows–Restricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restric ted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents whenreconciling the beginning 
and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $34 million 
as of January 31, 2019 , primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $300 million as of January 31, 2018 , primarily recorded in other long-termassets in the Consolidated Balan
ce Sheets.53

ReceivablesReceivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; banks for customercredit and debit cards 
and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; governments for income taxes; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and real estate transactions.Inventories
The Company values inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for Walmart U.S.segment's inventories. The inv
entory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retailinventory method of account
ing results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. Theinventory at the Sam's Club segmen
t is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximatedthose inventories as if th
ey were valued at FIFO.Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale repres
ent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company'sfinancial statem
ents with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.  The Company reviews all businesses and assetsheld for sale each reportin
g period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , immaterial amounts for assets a
nd liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are 
initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs andmaintenance are exp
ensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate theassets on a straight-lin
e basis:

   $104,317  $107,675 Leasehold improvements are
 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense forproperty and equipment, prope
rty under financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $10.7 billion , $10.5 billion and $10.1 billion , respectively.
Leases
The Company leases land, buildings, f
ixtures and equipment and transportation equipment. The Company estimates the expected lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options where aneconomic penalty exists 
that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. Theexpected lease term is used
 in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leaseholdimprovements is limited by
 the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease termand renewal is reasonably assu
red, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements andescalations are considered i
n the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.54

The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result inthe Company being deemed the owner o
f the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require theCompany to capitalize th
e lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine ifthese assets and the rel
ated financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assetsand the related finan
cing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of anyrenewal options, the net re
maining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are ini
tially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount maynot be recoverable. The ev
aluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by therelated assets are estimated over
 the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment ismeasured based upon the fai
r value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquiredintangible assets are s
tated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets arenot amortized; rather, they are
 evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assetsare considered long-liv
ed assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is assigned to the report
ing unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components havesimilar economic characteristics. 
As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's reporting units consis ted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment usingeither a qualitative or quantitati
ve approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment testis necessary. If manage
ment determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, orthat a fair value of 
the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwillimpairment is perfo
rmed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Afterevaluation, managemen
t determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl
ects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 : (Amounts in millions)

Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.Intangible assets are 
included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniqueswhich are updated annually bas
ed on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 55

Fair Value MeasurementIn January 2016, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01,  Financial Instruments–Overall (Topic 825 ) , which updated certain aspects of recognition, m
easurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments ("ASU 2016-01"). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted theCompany's accounting for its inves
tment in JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately  $2.6 billion , net of tax, based on the mark et value of theCompany's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. Th
e adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income,which the Company classifies in o
ther gains and losses.The Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transactionbetween unrelated, knowledgeab
le and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in atransaction between such pa
rties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensatio n, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedure
s and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect theultimate cost for c
laims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities areevaluated for appropri
ateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-lossinsurance coverage for work
ers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for h
edging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.Use of derivatives in hedging prog
rams subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivatives will change. In ahedging relationship, the ch
ange in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a derivative represents thepossibility that the count
erparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty,reviewing credit rat
ings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivatives with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognizedcredit rating agenc
ies. Subsequent to entering into derivatives, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivativesis used to measure inter
est to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk.The contractual ter
ms of the Company's derivatives closely mirror those of the hedged items, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the riskreduction and correla
tion criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offsetagainst the change in fa
ir value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized inearnings. Any hedge ineffect
iveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow hedges are highly effective and the ineffective portion has not been, and is notexpected to be, signific
ant. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealizedgains or losses reported in e
arnings during the period of the change.Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest tobe paid or received and do not 
represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate paymentsare designated as fai
r value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivatives match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivatives are assumed to be perfectly effectivehedges. Changes in the fair valu
es of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly,do not impact the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 . 56

Net Investment HedgesThe Company is a party to cross-cu
rrency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency forfixed-rate payments 
in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of therelated investment 
that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-cur
rency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuancesare designated and quali
fy as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsettingthe foreign currency translati
on adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certainnon-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are des
ignated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair valueof derivatives designat
ed as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedgedforecasted transaction affects earni
ngs. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment ofeffectiveness (and m
easurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amountthat offsets the related transacti
on gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with thehedging instrument. These der
ivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentat
ionRealized derivative g
ains and losses are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offsetderivative assets and l
iabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets,based on maturity date,
 and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentat ion of the Company'sderivatives. Additionally, 
the Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset and records cash collateral it posts with counterparties asamounts receivable from tho
se counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amou
nts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates ineffect for the year in whic
h those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in theperiod that includes the 
enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered whenassessing whether it is more 
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and otherrelevant quantitative and q
ualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal oftaxable temporary differences, f
orecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision whi
ch subjects a US parent of a foreign subsidiary to current US tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligiblefor a deduction, which lowers the 
effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 th rough 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will repor t the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost whenincurred. Accordingly, the Company 
is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.Discrete events such as audi
t settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.57

The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related tounrecognized tax benefi
ts in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax d
isclosures.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02,  
Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other ComprehensiveIncome 
 ("ASU 2018-02"). This ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act") in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retainedearnings. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which 
resulted in an immaterial negative adjustment to retained earnings.Revenue Recognition 
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue r ecognition model that requires a company to recognizerevenue to depict the t
ransfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASUon February 1, 2018, using the modified r
etrospective approach and applied this ASU only to contracts not completed as of February 1, 2018. The accounting policies and other disclosures are below aswell as the disclosure of dis
aggregated revenues in  Note 15 . The impact of adopting this ASU was not ma terial to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upondelivery to the customer.
 Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $1.4 billion for each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respect
ively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee isincluded in accrued li
abilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift c
ards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carryan expiration date; th
erefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business haveexpiration dates. Whil
e gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimatesunredeemed balances and 
recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.Management periodica
lly reviews and updates its estimates.Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's CondensedConsolidated Statements of In
come.Contract Balances
Contract balances as a r
esult of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company'sCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers:(Amounts in millions)

Cost of SalesCost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distributionfacilities to the s
tores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not areimbursement of specific, increme
ntal and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, marginprotection, advertising 
and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursementof specific, increm
ental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing andoccupancy for the Walm
art U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes aportion of the cost of its W
almart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable tothose of other retailers that
 may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed 
as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company'sConsolidated Statement
s of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction ofadvertising costs in opera
ting, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $3.5 billion , $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities
 of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustmentsare recorded as a compon
ent of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective localcurrencies to the U.S. dollar us
ing average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  
Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease asse ts and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures arealso required.  The Company will adop
t this ASU and related amendments as of the beginning of the first quarter of the year ending January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") and will be electing certain practicalexpedients permitted under
 the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. The Company will be exempting le
ases with an initial term of twelve months or less from balance sheet recognition and, for most classes of assets, the Company will be combining non-leasecomponents with lease componen
ts. Management has implemented and continues to implement new lease systems in connection with the adoption.The adoption of this ASU and related a
mendments will result in total assets and liabilities increasing approximately $15 billion , which is primarily due to r ecognizing approximately $17.5 billion of operating lease assets 
and liabilities, partially offset by derecognizing approximately $3 billion of assets and liabilit ies related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores.Several other line it
ems in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet will also be impacted by immaterial amounts. The Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows will not be materially 
impacted. Finally, management expects the first quarter fiscal 2020 disclosure of future operating commitments to significantly increase compared to the aggregateminimum rentals disc
losed in Note 11 , primarily because th e new standard requires reasonably assured renewals be included.59

Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measur ement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. TheCompany will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Managemen
t is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.60

The Company has awarded share-based 
compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expenseassociated with plans of the Comp
any's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $773 million , $626 million and $596 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Share-bas

centive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, wasestablished to grant stock op
tions, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart co mmon stock issued or to beissued under the Plan have been r
egistered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of itsshareholders.
61

The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:•
Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance shareunits vest based on the passage of 
time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amoun t. Vesting periods for these awards are generallybetween 
one and three years. Restricted stock and p erformance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Thefair value of restr
icted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grantusing the Company's stock price discoun
ted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividendyield used to determine t
he fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 6.2% , 7.2% and 8.3% , respectively. •
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant da te and the remaining 50% vest fiveyears from the grant da
te. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting periodand is recognized ratab
ly over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yieldused to determine the fair 
value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 7.2% , 9.0% and 9.0% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's Uni
ted Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-b ased compensationexpense is included in the Othe
r line in the table above.Flipkart also maintains 
a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. The grants have noexercise price and no co
mpensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2019 due to a liquidity event performance condition that was not deemed probable of occurrence.The following table shows the act

any repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal year 2019 were made under the curr
ent $20.0 billion share repurchase progra m approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can makeshare repurchases. 
As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases re mained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired andreturned to an unissued status.

The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity forleverage, cost of borrowings, r
esults of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a s ettlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased,average price paid per share

In May 2018, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its exist ing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program.The committed lines of credit
 in the table above mature at various times between May 2019 and May 2023 , carry interest ra tes generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points and LIBOR plus75 
basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observecertain covenants, the 
most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company also maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., withavailable amounts of app

The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivatives described in Note 8 . (2)
Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $8 million and $10 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of 
$82 million and $101 million , respectively. As of 
January 31, 2018 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. Thes e bonds matured in June 2018, and were fully repaid. The issuance of money market puttable resetsecurities in the amoun
t of $500 million is structured to be rem arketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time ofany interest rate r
eset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par.65

Accordingly as of January 31, 2018 , this issuance was classifi ed as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Annual maturities of long-

Fair
Value
MeasurementsAssets and liabilities r
ecorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company measures the fai
r value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated BalanceSheets. Measurement deta
ils about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows:•
The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, which prior to fiscal 2019 was classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized through othercomprehensive income; and
•
The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation in China, measured using Level 2 inputs.Fair value is determin
ed primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Prior to fiscal 2019, the investment was carried at cost.Information for the cos
t basis, carrying value and fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows:(Amounts in millions)

In addition to assets
 and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets arerecorded at fair value on a
 nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.As discussed in 
Note 13 , the Company sold the majority s take in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 billion and were comprised of $1.0 billion in current assets, 
$1.6 billion in property and equipment and p roperty under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $0.7 billion of other long-term asse ts. When measured as held for sale, these assets werefully impaired as the 
carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in the Walmart Int ernational segment, which wasrecorded in other gains and 
losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were immaterial.
68

For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 , the Company recorded impai rment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the following:
•
in the Sam's Club segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.6 billion for restructuring charges f or closures of underperforming clubs; the impaired assets consisted primarily of buildings and relatedstore fixtures, and leas
ed assets of its retail operations;•
in the Walmart International segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.2 billion for restructuring cha rges for the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business; the impaired assetsconsisted primarily of 
fixtures and equipment; and•
immaterial discontinued real estate projects in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and decisions to exit certain international properties in the Walmart International segment.These impairment cha
rges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value was determined based oncomparable market v
alues of similar properties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 werenot material.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-termmaturities.
The Company's long-term debt is a
lso recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowingarrangements. The car

$ 4,281  $4,600  $6,204 In December 2017, the Tax Act was ena
cted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused onforeign-sourced earnings 
and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"). In addition, the Companywas subject to a one-time 
transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bull
etin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allowed companies to reco rd provisional amounts duringa measurement period no
t to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Companymade reasonable esti
mates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the
measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While management be
lieves the Company's accounting for Tax Reform is complete, it is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by theIRS could impact the afore
mentioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million , and in fiscal 2019, the Company re corded $442 million 
of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes .One-time Transition Tax
The Tax Act required the Company to p
ay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash andcertain other net cu
rrent assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-tim
e transitional tax liability. The Company finalized the calculations of the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by  $413 million , with the increase includ edas a component of provision for 
income taxes in fiscal 2019.Deferred Tax Effects
The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory 
tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Comp any re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reducedrate that will apply in 
future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the redu ced U.S. tax rate andother effects of the T
ax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for theremeasurement of U.S. defe
rred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of  $75 million , which is included as a component o f provision for income taxes.69

Effective Income Tax Rate ReconciliationIn the past, the Company's effe
ctive income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower–taxed global operations, including the use of globalfunding structures and cer
tain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of Note 1 . However, beginning January 2018, the US statutory rate of 21.0% generally falls below statutory ra
tes in international jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income fromcontinuing operations is as fo

Unremitted EarningsPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asse
rted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested.  As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paidU.S. tax on the majority of its pr
eviously unremitted foreign earnings.  During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash relating to fis cal 2019 and prior earnings at a tax costof approximately 
$40 million .  As of January 31, 2019, the Company has not record ed approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earningsconsidered indefinite
ly reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of 
January 31, 2019 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling $12.2 billion . Of these carryforwards, $8.0 billion will expire, if not util ized, in various years through2039 
. The remaining carryfo rwards have no expiration. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's transition tax c alculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards.The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years,reversal of taxable 
temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax assetwill be recovered, a valu
ation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxassets will be recovered, 
the valuation allowance will be released.The Company had valuation allowanc
es of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, on defer red tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwardsfor which management has de
termined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition ofFlipkart and disposal of Wal
mart Brazil, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets and decreases due to operating lossexpirations and fluctua
tions in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized.Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions willwithstand challenge, if any, 
from taxing authorities.As of 
January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. The amount o f unrecognized tax benefits thatwould affect the Company's eff
ective income tax rate was $1.1 billion and $690 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. A reconciliation of unre
cognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:

ts by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolvingtax audits as expeditiously 
as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company doesnot expect any change to have 
a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 through 2019 . The Company also remains subjec t to income tax examinations forinternational incom
e taxes for fiscal 2012 through 2019 , and for U.S. state and local inco me taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2019 . 71

Other TaxesThe Company is subject to tax exa
minations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, theCompany has received assessmen
ts from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associatedwith these matters ar
e individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated FinancialStatements.

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. For som
e matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonablypossible and may be mater
ial, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believessettlement is in the b
est interest of the Company and its shareholders.Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financialcondition or results of oper
ations.ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, 
is a defendant in nearly 30,000 "equal value" claims th at are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the"Employment Tribunal") in th
e United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the workperformed by female 
employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse anddistribution facili
ties, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage ratesin the warehouse and distribut
ion facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.On March 23, 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tr
ibunal to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rulefor including multiple 
claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests. Following additional proceedings, on June 20, 2017, the EmploymentAppeal Tribunal ruled in favo
r of Asda on the "strike out" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12,2017, claimants sought permiss
ion from the Court of Appeals to appeal this ruling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the "strike out" issue was held onOctober 23, 2018. On January 17, 2019, the Court of Appeals de
clined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded theTribunal’s procedural rule.
As to the initial phase of th
e Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retailstores with those of employees 
in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also grantedpermission for Asda to appeal subs
tantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals. A hearing beforethe Court of Appeals on the compar
ability findings was held on October 10, 2018 and the Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings.Claimants are now proceeding 
in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda'swarehouse and distribution fa
cilities.At present, the Company cannot pred
ict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Companybelieves it has substanti
al factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.72

National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related MattersIn December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,healthcare providers, Na
tive American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigationis entitled 
In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court fo r the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some ofthe cases included in t
his multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.Plaintiffs are seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it hassubstantial factual 
and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations fromgovernmental entiti
es related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arisefrom these matters. Ac
cordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operationsor cash flows will not be mate
rially adversely affected.FCPA Investigation and Related Mat
tersThe Audit Committee (the "Audit Com
mittee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. ForeignCorrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other a
lleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether priorallegations of such viola
tions and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms andother advisors who are assisting 
in the on-going investigation of these matters.The Company has also been conducting a vo
luntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance p
rogram through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department ofJustice (the "DOJ") and the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the AuditCommittee and the Company have 
identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the AuditCommittee and the Company, toge
ther with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or investigations regardingallegations of potenti
al FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India.As previously disclosed, the Company is unde
r investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussionshave been ongoing regarding the 
resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded anaggregate accrual of 
$283 million with respect to these ma tters (the "Accrual"). As the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of thesematters.
A number of federal and loc
al government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters.  Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits rel
ating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers andcertain of Walmex's former officers
.  These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements.The Company could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subjectof some or all of the on-going gov
ernment investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or otherrelief, crimina
l convictions and/or penalties and shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. TheCompany expects that there wi
ll be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception amongcertain audiences of 
the Company's role as a corporate citizen.73

In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connectionwith the government investig
ations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2019 
, 2018 and 2017 , the Company incurred the fol lowing third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:

Acquisitions,
Disposals
and
Related
Items
The following significant t
ransactions impact, or are expected to impact, the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or beenannounced.
Walmart Brazil
In August 2018, the Company sold an 
80 percent stake of Walmart Bra zil to Advent International ("Advent"). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walma
rt agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent considerat ion.  The disposal groupconsisted of the following:
•
Assets of $3.3 billion , which were fully impaired as discussed in Note 7 upon meeting the held for sa le criteria;•
Liabilities of $1.3 billion , consisting of $0.7 billion in accounts payable and ac crued liabilities, $0.1 billion of capital lease and financing obligations, and $0.5 billion of deferred taxes and other long-term liabilities; and
•
Cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion , which was reclassified fro m accumulated other comprehensive loss (see Note 4 ). As a result, the Company 
recorded a pre-tax ne t loss of $4.8 billion during during fiscal 2019 in othe r gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income . In calculating the loss, thefair value of the disposa
l group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemni ty, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under 
the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Br
azilian interbank deposit rate.The Company deconsolidated the f
inancial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest, deter mined to haveno initial fair valu
e, using the equity method of accounting.Flipkart
In August 2018, the Company acquired 
81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipk art, an Indian-based eCommerc e marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately 
$16 billion . The acquisition increas es the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain taxitems, is as follows:
•
Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primari ly of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.6 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, 
$4.7 billion represents the fair v alue of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservableinputs. The remaining 
$0.3 billion of intangible assets primaril y relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipatedsynergies and economies of sc
ale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;•
Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primari ly of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and •
Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. 75

The Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . To finance the acquisit ion, the Company used a combination of cashprovided by long-term debt as d
iscussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart resul ts of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial.Asda
In April 2018, the Company entered in
to a definitive agreement and announced the proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda Group"), the Company's wholly owned UKretail subsidiary. Under th
e terms of the combination, the Company would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital o f the combined company. In addition, the Company would receiveapproximately 
£3 billion in cash, subject to customa ry closing adjustments, and retain obligations under the Asda Group defined benefit pension pl an . Due to a complex regulatory review process, theoutcome of which continues to be un
certain, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group was not met as of January 31, 2019 . If the transaction c loses, the Company would deconsolidatethe financial stat
ements of Asda Group and account for the ongoing investment in the combined company using the equity method of accounting.Suburbia
In April 2017, the Company sold Suburbia, the app
arel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agree ment, the Company is also leasing certain real estate to the purchaser. The saleresulted in a pre-tax g
ain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second qua rter of fiscal 2018 in membership and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is beingrecognized over the lease term
s of approximately 20 years . Yihaodian and JD
In June 2016, the Company sold certain 
assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary shares 
of JD, valued at $1.5 billion , representing approxima tely five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain, which was included in membe
rship and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares, representing an inc
remental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approx imately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. The following significant t
ransaction primarily impacts the Company's Walmart U.S. segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced.Jet.com, Inc.
In September 2016, the Company compl
eted the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. segment is building upon the currenteCommerce foundation, al
lowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The allocation of the pur
chase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part o f the transaction, the Company is paying additional compensation of approximately$0.8 billion 
over a five year period. Note

Segments
and
Disaggregated
Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,India, Japan, Mexico and the Unit
ed Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior  to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 . The Company's operations are conduc ted in threereportable segments: 
Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularlyreviews to analyze perfo
rmance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each ofthese individual products and s
ervices.The Walmart U.S. segment inc
ludes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of theCompany's operations outside of the U.S., as wel
l as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.comand omni-channel initi
atives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time totime, the Company revises th
e measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised 
certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability. Information for the Company's s
egments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:(Amounts in millions)

CONTROLS
AND
PROCEDURES General
Management is responsible 
for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial State
ments were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements,management is requir
ed to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances.The Audit Committee of the Board o
f Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed ofthe financial condit
ion of Walmart Inc. and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reportingand the objectivity of our 
financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both withand without management pres
ent.Acting through our Audit Committee, we h
ave retained Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. We have made ava
ilable to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filedwith the SEC the required cert
ifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 . These certificat ions are attached as exhibits to this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have also p
rovided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the NewYork Stock Exchange's corporate govern
ance listing standards.Evaluation
of
Disclosure
Controls
and
Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated tomanagement in a tim
ely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide onlyreasonable assurance of 
achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments inunconsolidated entities. Sin
ce we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect toour consolidated subsidiari
es.In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, whileensuring that we maintain 
an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manualprocesses, standardizing con
trols globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. During fiscal 2019, we announced an agreement tooutsource select accoun
ting transaction-processing activities which is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance our shared service model. These changes have not materially affected, and are notreasonably likely to ma
terially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure thatour internal control envir
onment remains effective.An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and withthe participation of 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded thatour disclosure controls and pro
cedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, is a
ccumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC'srules and forms.

Report
on
Internal
Control
Over
Financial
ReportingManagement has responsibil
ity for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonableassurance regarding the relia
bility of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States. Because of its inh
erent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of January 31, 2019 . In making its assessment, m anagement has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of theTreadway Commission in Interna
l Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofJanuary 31, 2019 
. The Company's internal control ov er financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stat ed in their report which appears herein.Under guidelines established by 
the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based onthose guidelines, managem
ent's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which the Company acquired infiscal 2019, except for th
e recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management's assessment. Flipkart represented approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as ofJanuary 31, 2019, after excluding goodwi
ll and intangible assets recorded, and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company's acquisition of Flipkartis discussed in 
Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial St atements for fiscal 2019.Changes

WALMART DEFERRED COMPENSATION MATCHING PLAN ARTICLE I. GENERAL 1.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan. 1.2 Effective Date. The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2019. 1.3 Nature of Plan. The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder. ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS 2.1 Definitions.

Regs. Sec. 1.414(c)-2 for purposes of determining a controlled group of trades or businesses under Code Section 414(c), the language “at least 50 percent” shall be used instead of “at least 80 percent” in each place it appears in Treas.

Once selected, the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to any Scheduled In-Service Account is irrevocable. If a Participant fails to designate a Scheduled Pay Date with respect to a Scheduled In-Service Account, then the Participant is deemed to have designated as the Scheduled Pay Date for such Scheduled In-Service Account the first day of the second Plan Year beginning after the Plan Year for which Deferral Credits are first allocated to such Scheduled In-Service Account. (bb) Separation from Service means the Participant has a termination of employment (other than on account of death) with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph, “Company” means the Employer and any Related Affiliate.

For this purpose, a Participant is not treated as having a Separation from Service while he or she is on a military leave, sick leave, orot
her bona fide leave of absence, if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Participant has a right to reemployment with the Company under an applicable statute or by contract. This definition of Separation from Service is intended to be consistent with the separation from service requirements as defined in Code Section 409A. (cc) Separation Pay Date means the last day of the calendar month in which falls the date that is six (6) months after a Participant’s Separation from Service. - 5 -
 

(dd) Special Bonus means a bonus, other than a bonus payable under the MIP, that is payable to an Eligible Officer with respect to services rendered or to be rendered for an Employer and that is eligible for deferral under the Plan either because (1) the bonus is payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by the Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the bonus by explicit reference to this Plan or (2) the bonus is eligible for deferral in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee, or by an officer to whom the Committee has delegated authority to establish such guidelines, and the bonus requires as a condition of receipt of the bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the bonus that the recipient continue to perform services for the Employer for a period of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he or she obtains the legally binding right to the bonus. (ee) Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant’s spouse, the Participant’s beneficiary, or the Participant’s dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) and (d)(1)(B)), the loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. (ff) Valuation Date means each day of the Plan Year. (gg) Walmart means Walmart Inc., a Delaware corporation. (hh) Years of Participation means a period of Plan Years which includes the first Plan Year with respect to which an Eligible Participant makes a deferral election in accordance with any one or more of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 and an amount is credited to the Participant’s Account with respect to any such deferral election, and each subsequent Plan Year during all or part of which the Participant remains a Participant. In addition to the preceding definition, a Participant’s Years of Participation shall include any period commencing February 1 and ending January 31, whether before or after the effective date of the Plan, during which or with respect to which an account is maintained for the Participant under the Walmart Inc. Officer Deferred Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time. ARTICLE III. DEFERRAL CREDITS AND MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CREDITS AND ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS 3.1 Deferred Compensation. (a) For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer, as Deferred Compensation, all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Compensation to be otherwisepaid 
for such Plan Year by the Employer, provided, however, that no election shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an - 6 -
 

Eligible Officer to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A . The Eligible Officer’s Deferred Compensation will be deferred proratably for each payroll period of the Plan Year. If a payroll period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Deferred Compensation with respect to such payroll period shall be determined by the Eligible Officer’s deferral election made with respect to the Plan Year in which the payroll period ends. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. (b) Compensation deferral elections must be filed: (1) With respect to an individual who is an Eligible Officer as of the December 31 preceding the Plan Year for which the deferral election is to be effective, no later than such December 31; or (2) With respect to an individual who first becomes an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Officer. For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year only if: (A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Officer; or (B) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment. A deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only with respect to Compensation for payroll periods beginning after the payroll period in which the Eligible Officer’s election form (which may be electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. In addition, a deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only if the deferral election meets the requirements set forth in Code Section 409A(a)(4)(B). - 7 -
 

(c) The Deferred Compensation of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Compensation under this Section 3.1 with respect to a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.2 Deferred MIP Bonuses. (a) For each Plan Year, each Eligible Participant may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s bonus (if any) to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Participant under the MIP with respect to a performance period under the MIP that coincides with the Plan Year or that ends within the Plan Year; provided, however, an Eligible Participant who is not an Eligible Officer may elect to defer no more than eighty percent (80%) of the Eligible Participant’s MIP bonus for a Plan Year. No election under this Section 3.2 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. (b) MIP bonus deferral elections must be filed: (1) No later than the December 31 (or such other date as determined by the Committee or its delegate) preceding the first day of the performance period for which the deferral election is to be effective. (2) If authorized by the Committee or its delegate with respect to an Eligible Participant, and if the MIP bonus constitutes “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A based on services performed over a performance period of at least twelve (12) months, and if the Eligible Participant has been continuously employed by an Employer or a Related Affiliate since the first day of the performance period, then no later than the earlier of (i) the date that is six months prior to the last day of the performance period, or (ii) the date in the performance period as of which the amount of the MIP bonus has become both substantially certain to be paid and calculable. (3) Solely with respect to an Eligible Officer who first becomes an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Participant, as described in Code Section409
A(a)(4)(B). For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year only if: - 8 -
 

(A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Participant; or (B) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment. An MIP bonus deferral election under this Section 3.2(b)(3) will be effective only with respect to an MIP bonus paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the MIP bonus payable to the Eligible Officer for services rendered subsequent to the Eligible Officer’s election will be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days remaining in the performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in such performance period. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b)(3), the date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. (c) The Deferred MIP Bonus of an Eligible Participant who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s MIP bonus under this Section 3.2 with respect to a performance period that coincides with a Plan Year or that ends within a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Participant’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.3 Deferred Special Bonuses. (a) An Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special Bonus to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Officer in a Plan Year. All Special Bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.3 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation.

A.For purposes of this Section 3.3, the date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by - 9 -
 

Executive Compensation. A deferral election is not permitted with respect to a Special Bonus unless the Special Bonus is a type described in, and the deferral election with respect to the Special Bonus satisfies the applicable conditions of, Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c). (b) A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) is one that: (1) requires as a condition of receipt of the Special Bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the Special Bonus that the Eligible Officer continue to perform services for a period of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he or she obtains the legally binding right to the Special Bonus; (2) may not have an earlier vesting date for a good reason termination or the Eligible Officer’s retirement; and (3) must otherwise meet the qualifications as described in Code Section 409A. The deferral election with respect to a Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) must be filed within thirty (30) days after the Eligible Officer obtains the legally binding right to the Special Bonus. (c) A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(c) is one payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by an Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the Special Bonus by explicit reference to the Plan. The deferral election with respect to a Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(c) must be filed prior to the time the Eligible Officer renders any services to the Employer, regardless of whether the deferral election relates to all of the Special Bonus or a portion of the Special Bonus. (d) The Deferred Special Bonus of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special Bonus under this Section 3.3 otherwise payable in a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.4 Employer Matching Contribution Credits. (a) If a Participant is employed by the Employer or any Related Affiliate on the last day of the Plan Year and has not incurred a Separation from Service during that Plan Year and if Deferral Credits have been made to the Participant’s Account with respect to the Plan Year, then to the extent applicable under the following provisions of this Section 3.4 an Employer Matching Contribution Credit will be made to the Participant’s Matching Account. The amount of the Employer Matching Contribution Credit, if any, made to a Participant’s Matching Account for the Plan Year will equal the total amount of Deferred Compensation and Deferred MIP Bonus credited to the Participant’sAcco
unt for the Plan Year under Section 3.1(c) and Section 3.2(c); provided, however, in no event shall the Employer Matching Contribution Credit made to a Participant’s Matching Account for a Plan Year exceed 6% of the Participant’s Excess Compensation for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 3.4(a), an Employer Matching Contribution Credit for a Plan Year shall not be - 10 -
 

made with respect to any Deferral Credits for the Plan Year that have been withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.5. (b) A Participant shall become vested in his or her Matching Account, including earnings thereon, if the Participant has completed at least three (3) Years of Participation. If a Participant is not otherwise vested in the Participant’s Matching Account under the preceding sentence of this Section 3.4(b), the Participant will become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account if the Participant dies prior to the Participant’s Separation from Service, or if the Participant is Disabled. Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, a Participant’s Matching Account shall be distributed pursuant to Article V only if the Participant has become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account under this Section 3.4(b) as of the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service. 3.5 Account Allocation Elections (a) At the same time that an Eligible Participant makes an election to defer Compensation, an MIP bonus, or a Special Bonus in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate the amount or amounts subject to each such deferral election to a Retirement Account or Accounts or to a Scheduled In-Service Account or Accounts. In addition to the preceding requirement, at the same time that an Eligible Participant makes an election to defer Compensation or an MIP bonus in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate the Employer Matching Contribution Credits (if any) with respect to such Deferred Compensation or Deferred MIP Bonus to a Retirement Account or Accounts. (b) At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer Matching Contribution Credit) to a Retirement Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the form of distribution with respect to such Retirement Account. The form of distribution must be a form permitted under Section 5.4(a). (c) At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus or Deferred Special Bonus) to a Scheduled In-Service Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to such Scheduled In-Service Account. (d) If at the time of an Eligible Participant’s deferral election under the Plan theEli
gible Participant fails to make an account allocation election under Section 3.5(a), then the amount subject to such deferral election shall be allocated in the same manner as the same category of deferred amounts (meaning either - 11 -
 

Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer Matching Contribution Credits) were allocated for the most recent preceding Plan Year for which the Eligible Participant made an allocation election, but if none then to the Eligible Participant’s Retirement Account if there is only one, or equally to the Eligible Participant’s Retirement Accounts if the Eligible Participant has more than one Retirement Accounts, but if the Eligible Participant has no Retirement Account then the amount subject to such deferral election shall be allocated to a Retirement Account deemed to be elected by the Participant with a lump sum form of payment, and such Retirement Account shall be one of the Participant’s permitted Retirement Accounts under the Plan. 3.6 Irrevocability of Deferral Elections and Account Allocation Elections. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, once made for a Plan Year, a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(1), 3.2(b)(1) and 3.2(b)(2), and the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or modified after the applicable deferral election filing deadline specified in Sections 3.1(b)(1), 3.2(b)(1), and 3.2(b)(2), and a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c), and the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or modified after the date of each such deferral election as provided in Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c). A deferral election for one Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if a deferral is desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Participant. (b) In the event an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral election under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the date of such Separation from Service (but will be effective with respect to the last regular paycheck issued to such Eligible Officer), regardless of whether the Eligible Officer continues to receive Compensation, or other remuneration, from any Employer or Related Affiliate thereafter. If an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Officer) within the same Plan Year, his or her deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall be automatically reinstated and shall remain in effect for the remainder of such Plan Year. (c) In the event an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral elections, if any, under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 willre
main in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral election. If an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Participant) within the same Plan Year or the same performance period, his or her deferral elections, if any, under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral elections. - 12 -
 

(d) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account of a Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the next following January 31. In addition, in the event the Compensation of such individual is reduced as a result of the change in status, his or her deferral election following such loss and through the date of termination of such election as provided in the preceding sentence will be pro rated based on his or her new level of Compensation. (e) In the event an Eligible Officer receives Company-paid short term disability payments and the Compensation of such individual is reduced as a result of the short term disability status, then following such reduction in Compensation his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will be pro rated based on his or her new level of Compensation through the date of termination of such election. (f) In the event an Eligible Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant (other than on account of a Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.2 will terminate for any performance period beginning in the calendar year following the year of the loss of Eligible Participant status. (e) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account of Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.3 will remain in effect. (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event an Eligible Officer goes on an unpaid leave of absence, his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall automatically cease when he or she commences the unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that if he or she returns from the unpaid leave of absence during the same Plan Year, his or her Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1 shall automatically resume immediately upon return from the leave of absence and shall continue in effect for the balance of the Plan Year. An Eligible Officer’s Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1, if any, shall remain in effect with respect to any Compensation to which such election applies that is paid while on a leave of absence. An Eligible Participant’s deferral election under Sections 3.2 or 3.3, if any, shall not be affected by his or her leave of absence. 3.7 Automatic Suspension of Deferral Elections. (a) In the event a Participant receives a distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan (or any other planor 
successor plan sponsored by Walmart or any Related Affiliate) on account of hardship, which distribution is made pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) and requires suspension of deferrals under other arrangements such as this Plan, the Participant’s deferral - 13 -
 

elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, pursuant to which deferrals would otherwise be made during the six (6)-month period following the date of the distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan shall be cancelled. (b) In the event a Participant requests a distribution pursuant to Section 5.5 due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, or the Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan in order to alleviate his or her Unforeseeable Emergency, and the Committee or its delegate determines that the Participant’s Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through the cessation of deferrals under the Plan, some or all the Participant’s deferral elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, for such Plan Year as determined by the Committee or its delegate, shall be cancelled as soon as administratively practicable following such determination by the Committee or its delegate. ARTICLE IV. ACCOUNTS AND TIMING OF CREDITS TO ACCOUNTS 4.1 Nature of Accounts. Each Participant’s Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under this Plan. The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant’s Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant’s rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein.

This rate shall be determined on the basis of Federal Reserve Statistical Release H-15 (or any successor statistical release of the Federal Reserve) and, if there is no such statistical release, on the basis of such other generally recognized source of information concerning the market for United States Treasury securities as the Committee selects.

(c) Installment Distributions. (1) If a Participant’s Retirement Account is to be distributed in the form of annual installments, the first such installment shall be made within the 90- day period commencing on the first January 31 following the Participant’s Separation from Service; provided, however, that if such January 31 is earlier than the Participant’s Separation Pay Date, the first such installment shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the Participant’s Separation Pay Date. Subsequent installments shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on each successive January 31, until the Participant’s benefits under such Account are distributed in full. (2) The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Retirement Account determined in accordance with Section 5.2(b)(2) (using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s Separation from Service occurs. 5.3 Death Benefits.

(d) Death After Commencement of Installments. Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a Participant’s death after installment payments to the Participant have commenced, such installment payments shall continue to be made to the Participant’s designated beneficiary in the same manner as they were being distributed to the Participant prior to his or her death, provided, however, that if the Participant’s distribution election applicable to Section 5.3(a) is a lump sum payment, the Participant’s remaining installments will be distributed in lump sum to the Participant’s designated beneficiary within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’s death occurs. (e) Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries (which may be a trust or trusts) to receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant’s death, and may designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. A Participant may change such designation from time to time and the last designation filed with the Committee in accordance with its procedures prior to the Participant’s death will control.

(b) Subsequent Elections. In accordance with the procedures and rules established by the Company, a Participant may change his or her distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, his or her Account, per this Section 5.4 at any time by making a new election (referred to in this subsection as a “subsequent election”) on a form (which may be electronic) approved by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department and filed with Executive Compensation; provided, however, that such subsequent election shall be subjectto t
he following restrictions: - 18 -

In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the Participant’s most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b). (c) Filing of Election. A Participant’s distribution election applicable to the Participant’s Account in the event of the Participant’s death prior to Separation from Service, and a Participant’s distribution election with respect to the Participant’s Retirement Account or Retirement Accounts, and the Participant’s Scheduled Pay Date with respect to the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts, must be filed with Executive Compensation on forms (which may be electronic) prescribed by Executive Compensation. 5.5 Distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies.

The Committee will permit distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, plusa
mounts necessary to pay federal, state or local income taxes and penalties reasonably - 19 -
 

anticipated to result from the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant’s or beneficiary’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be made from the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then proratably from the remaining amount of the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts and then proratably from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts. (b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect to any distribution under this Section 5.5 that occurs prior to January 1, 2021 would not be permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m); such payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction would not be permitted until the earliest date at which it reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution would not be barred by application of Code Section 162(m); provided, however, that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date. 5.6 Distributions for Payment of Taxes Walmart’s Senior Vice President of Global Compensation, or any successor position, may accelerate and pay a portion of a Participant’s Plan benefits in a lump sum equal to (a) the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed on Plan benefits and any income tax withholding related to such amounts, as well as (b) any state, local or foreign tax obligations arising from participation in the Plan (and related withholding under Code Section 3401) that apply to the amounts deferred under the Plan before such amount is paid or made available to the Participant. 5.7 Reductions Arising from a Participant’s Gross Misconduct. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant’s Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunderto t
he contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Matching Contribution Credits and credited Plan earnings thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining - 20 -
 

installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant’s Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus and Deferred Special Bonus. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7. ARTICLE VI. ADMINISTRATION 6.1 General.

In the exercise of such allocated responsibilities, any action of the member to whom responsibilities are allocated shall have the same force and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee. The Committee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of such member. The member to whom responsibilities have been allocated shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the discharge of the allocated responsibilities.

No interest or amounts payable under the Plan may be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary. Notwithstanding the preceding, distribution may be made to the extent necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B) and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee from time to time; provided, however, that all such distributions shall be made in a single lump sum payment. 8.3 Recovery of Overpayments.
