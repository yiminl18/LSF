BUSINESS Overview
eBay
 Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  wereincorporated in Delaware, and in S
eptember 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices arelocated
 at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated orthe
 context  otherwise  requires,  when  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us”  or  “eBay”  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  mean  eBay  Inc.  and  itsconsolidated
 subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. On November 24, 2019, weentered into a definitive agreement for eBay to sell StubH
ub to viagogo, with closing of the transaction expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020.eBay
 Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millionsof
 buyers and sellers around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity. Our technologies and services are designed to give buyerschoice
 and  a  breadth  of  relevant  inventory  and  to  enable  sellers  worldwide  to  organize  and  offer  their  inventory  for  sale,  virtually  anytime  andanywhere.
 Our  Marketplace  platforms  include our  online marketplace  located at  www.ebay.com,  its  localized counterparts,  including off-platformbusinesses
 in Korea, Japan and Turkey and the eBay suite of mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’s largest and most vibrantmarketplac
es for discovering great value and unique selection. StubHub platforms include the online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, itslocaliz
ed counterparts and the StubHub mobile apps. These platforms connect fans with their favorite sporting events, shows and artists and enablethem to
 buy and sell millions of tickets annually, whenever and wherever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands such asmobile.de,
 Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. Offering online classifieds around the world, these platforms help peoplefind what they are looking for in their local communities.
Our
 platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience (e.g., desktop and laptop computers), mobile devices (e.g., smartphonesand
 tablets) and our application programming interfaces or APIs (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-screen approachoffers
 downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of our other websitesand vertical shopping experi
ences. Our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-standard ways for softwaredevelop
ers and merchants to access our APIs and develop software and solutions for commerce. In 2019, we launched new API capabilities to givethird-party developers access to eBay programs like managed p
ayments.Agreement to Sell StubHub
On
 November 24, 2019, following a strategic review of our assets, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell StubHub to viagogo for apurchase
 price of $4.05 billion in cash. Please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “The closing of the proposed sale ofStubHub
 is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with expected plans or on the currently contemplatedtimeline, or at all, and the pending sale may be disru
ptive to StubHub.”4

Our StrategyDelivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most pow
erful selling platformOur
 strategy is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We focus onconnecting
 buyers and sellers through simplified experiences to make it easier for users to list, buy and sell items, and we are working to serve ourcustomers in an authentically eBay way.
On
 our Marketplace platform, our strategy is to drive the best choice by attracting and retaining sellers and brands that bring differentiatedinventory
 to eBay and provide our consumers with great selection and value. This includes new, everyday items as well as rare and unique goods,many
 of which are available with free shipping and delivery in three business days or less. Our vision is to provide buyers with value and selectionthrough
 the spectrum of value of the inventory. We continue to invest in product and initiatives to evolve the customer experience, making it easierfor buyers to find inventory on the platform.
 
As
 a trusted ticket marketplace, StubHub brings the joy of live events to fans globally. In 2019, over 268 million visitors came to StubHub tobuy or
 sell tickets to live sports, music, theater and other events. StubHub business partners include more than 100 leagues, teams, venues, eventsor
 other major third-party companies in the U.S. and internationally across major sports leagues such as the NFL, MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, and theNCAA. StubHub is a leader in mobil
e innovation, with roughly 60% of its orders coming from mobile in 2019.A
 world leader in online classifieds, eBay Classifieds is designed to help people list their products and services, generally for free, find whatthey
 are  looking  for  in  their  local  communities  and  trade  at  a  local  level.  eBay  Classifieds  Group’s  brands  offer  both  horizontal  and  verticalexperiences,
 such as motors, real estate and jobs. We offer a personalized classifieds experience and focus on expanding our value proposition byleveraging data and analytics to improve customer relev
ance and grow the classifieds opportunity on mobile.Business model and pricing
On
 eBay  and  StubHub,  our  business  model  and  pricing  are  designed  so  that  our  business  is  successful  primarily  when  our  sellers  aresuccessful.
 We make money primarily through fees collected on successfully closed sales. On our Classifieds platform, we monetize our businessprimarily through advertising.
In 2019, managed payments adoption acce
lerated in the U.S. and the service launched in Germany. Since we began intermediating paymentsin
 2018,  we  processed  over  $2.0  billion  in  payments  for  nearly  25,000  sellers  through  December  31,  2019.  Our  advertising  business  remainsfocused on growing our promoted listing fees (first-party advertising busine
ss) while reducing non-strategic third-party advertising in a manner that isconducive to growth in our core Marketplace; over 1 million sel
lers used the product, promoting over 320 million live listings in 2019.Our offerings for buyers and sellers
We
 provide a number of features for our buyers and sellers that are designed to build trust, help users feel more comfortable buying andselling
 on our platforms and reward our top sellers for their loyalty. We believe that, through our sellers, eBay offers some of the best value anddeals available
 for a number of consumer products. Buyers seek out eBay because they can find an enormous breadth of inventory and a spectrumof value from the brand new to the hard-to-find.
On
 the Marketplace platform, we continue to explore new tools and features that are intended to create a better buying experience on eBay,including Visual Sh
opping via Computer Vision, Right Offer at the Right Time, and Buy Again.In
 order  to remain competitive  and create  a vibrant  seller experience, eBay continuously  invests  in tools and programs  to grow the sellerecosystem
 because  we  only  win  when  our  sellers  succeed.  In  2019,  we  added  analytics  and  merchandising  tools  to  our  Seller  Hub  that  aredesigned
 so  that  sellers  know  what  to  sell,  when  to  sell  it  and  at  what  price.  The  2019  additions  of  Multi-User  Account  Access,  along  with  theTerapeak integration, enable sellers to better
 manage their business and add additional analytics insights into the platform. We also established newseller
 protections, including two new financial protections for top-rated sellers located in the U.S. who offer 30-day returns. First, eBay will issue aseller invoice credit to cover return label cost if a buyer makes a false “item not as described”
5

claim. Second, eBay now allows these sellers to issue partial refunds for all items that are returned damaged. eBay also has processes that allowsellers to report buyers who violate policies.
eBay
 is  committed  to  maintaining  a  safe  and  trusted  marketplace.  In  order  to  further  strengthen  our  buyers’  confidence  and  trust  in  ourservices,
 we offer eBay Money Back Guarantee, which allows buyers to get their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty ordamaged,
 or  if  it  does  not  match  the  listing.  eBay  Money  Back  Guarantee  covers  most  items  purchased  on  the  eBay  platform  in  a  number  ofcountries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia, through a qual
ifying payment method. Some purchases, including some vehicles, arenot
 covered. We also offer eBay Authenticate, through which sellers can have their high-end handbags, luxury watches and jewelry authenticated.The
 program is available in the United States as well as in the U.K. and Germany. We also provide our customers with a Best Price Guarantee,which
 offers buyers in the United States 110 percent of the price difference if they find an item for less on a competitor’s website within 48 hours ofmaking a purchase. In Australia, Best Price Guarantee beats deals from approve
d retailers by 5%, and in U.K., offers price matching.For
 buyers, we want to create greater confidence in our ability to meet their delivery and buying expectations and to improve the reliability ofour shipping
 times and tracking. The majority of our transactions on the eBay Marketplace in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany include free shipping,and we
 encourage sellers to offer free returns. Through eBay Guaranteed Delivery, we provide faster and more precise delivery dates on millions ofeligible items.
Our Impact and Responsibility
eBay’s purpose is to empower people a
nd create economic opportunity for all. Every day, people build businesses on eBay, and we are drivento
 support them. Both in our community and through our technology, we work to create economic opportunity. Our impact efforts are divided intofour programs that align with our purpose: eBay for Charity, eBay Foundatio
n, Retail Revival, and Responsible Business.eBay
 for Charity empowers eBay buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. Since its inception, eBay for Charity has raisedmore than $1 billion for more than 83,000 charities.
eBay’s
 Foundation  helps  build  economically  vibrant  and  thriving  communities  through  several  key  initiatives  like  Global  Give,  which  is  anannual
 employee-led  grantmaking  program  that  deploys  the  talents  and  passions  of  eBay  employees.  Through  the  program,  employees  cometogether
 to create teams, partner with local nonprofits, and develop projects that support small businesses and entrepreneurs in their communities.In 2019, the eBay Foundation awarde
d approximately $1 million through Global Give.Retail Revival,
 which launched in early 2018, also demonstrates eBay’s commitment to economic development and entrepreneurialism. RetailRevival
 empowers local businesses to compete on a global scale and thrive in an online economy. In close partnership with local governments andstakeholders,
 eBay onboards cohorts of small businesses and supports their growth through months of in-depth training, individual coaching, andpromotional
 support, all provided at no cost to the participants or partner cities. Since launch, eBay has welcomed new U.S. cities to the RetailRevival
 program, including: Lansing, Michigan; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and scaled the program internationally toCanada, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Russia, and Bulgaria.
Finally, as
 a part of the company’s Responsible Business efforts, eBay strives to operate in an environmentally and socially sustainable way -creating
 a safe, trusted, and diverse environment in which our employees, buyers, sellers, suppliers, and partners can thrive. In 2019, eBay madeseveral
 partnership  announcements,  working  to  reach  its  goal  of  100%  renewable  energy  by  2025.  This  includes  two  local  renewable  energyprograms
 with  energy  providers  in  Draper,  Utah,  and  San  Jose,  California.  These  two  locations  join  Dreilinden,  Germany;  Dublin,  Ireland;  andPortland, Oregon in 100% renewable e
nergy sourcing.6

Financial InformationWe
 measure our footprint in our addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”). GMV consists of the total value of allsuccessfully
 closed transactions between users on our Marketplace or StubHub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether thebuyer
 and  seller  actually  completed  the  transaction.  In 2019 ,  we  generated  over  $90  billion  in  GMV,  of  which  approximately 60  percent was generate
d outside the U.S. Despite GMV’s divergence from revenue during 2019, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overallvolume of
 closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV of closed transactions that arenot ultimately consummated.
At
 the end of 2019, our Marketplace and StubHub platforms had more than 180 million active buyers and over one billion live listings globally.The
 term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace or StubHub platformswithin the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once an
d, as a result, may have more than one account.We
 generate revenue primarily from the transactions we successfully enable and through marketing services, including classifieds and ourgrowth
 initiatives  of  payments  and  advertising.  The  majority  of  our  revenue  comes  from  a  take  rate  on  the  GMV  of  transactions  closed  on  ourMarketplace and StubHub platforms. We define “take rate” as net transaction revenues divi
ded by GMV.The
 size  and  scale  of  our  platforms  are  designed  to  enable  our  buyers  and  sellers  to  leverage  our  economies  of  scale  and  capitalinvestments, such as in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisitio
n, technology innovation and customer service.Notable Business Transactions in 2019
We
 regularly  review  and  manage  our  investments  to  ensure  that  they  support  eBay’s  strategic  direction  and  complement  our  disciplinedapproach
 to value creation, profitability and capital allocation. In the first quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of Motors.co.uk, a U.K.-based
 classifieds site, for $93 million. The Motors.co.uk team joined Gumtree UK, an eBay Classifieds business. In the second quarter of 2019, weinvested $160 million in Paytm Mall, an eC
ommerce marketplace in India. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sellStubHub; see “Agreement to Sell StubHub” section for more details.
Competition
We
 encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through avariety
 of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and exportcompanies,
 auctioneers,  catalog  and  mail-order  companies,  classifieds,  directories,  search  engines,  commerce  participants  (consumer-to-consumer,
 business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden intonew
 categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels forthose new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and servic
es, and global scale.For
 more  information  regarding  risks  of  competition,  see  the  information  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “Substantial  andincreasingly
 intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigationunder competition laws that could adversely imp
act our business.”To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expe
nd significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantialexpenditures,
 which could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cashflows
 and  reduce  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  and  outstanding  debt  securities.  Despite  our  efforts  to  preserve  and  expand  the  size,diversity
 and  transaction  activity  of  our  buyers  and  sellers  and  to  enhance  the  user  experience,  we  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  manage  ouroperating expenses, to increase or maintain our reven
ue or to avoid a decline in our consolidated net income or a net loss.Government Regulation
Government
 regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerceindustry in many countries where we operate. With the continued state ad
option of Internet7

sales tax laws in 2019, more buyers across the U.S. are encountering sales tax for the first time on the eBay platform. To date, more than 30 stateshave
 implemented Internet sales tax and digital service tax legislation. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complexsales
 and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens for buyers and sellers on our websites and mobileplatforms.
For
 more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our business is subject toextensive
 government regulation and oversight” and “Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.”
Seasonality
We
 expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financ
ial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”Technology
eBay Inc.’s platforms use a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provi
ded by others. Wehave
 developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer, seller and developer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that helpenable
 our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing oflarge
 amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administrationof
 large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the eventof outages or catastrophic occurrences.
For
 information  regarding  technology-related  risks,  see  the  information  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “Systems  failures  orcyberattacks
 and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products or servicescould harm our business” and “Regulatio
n in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.”In
 support of our ongoing commitment to innovation and a better customer experience, we have been on a multi-year evolution to modernizeour
 marketplace. Through technologies like artificial intelligence, which is woven into all aspects of the eBay marketplace, we are anticipating theneeds
 of buyers, sellers and developers empowering entrepreneurs looking to grow their business, and making the platform more accessible toeveryone. We aim to create highly personalized an
d inspiring shopping experiences powered by advanced technologies.Intellectual Property
We
 regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectu
al property rights by relyingon federal, state and common
 law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractualrestrictions
 to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreementswith
 our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure ofour proprietary information.
 
We
 pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filedU.S.
 and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domainname,
 trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual propertyrights
 and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  besuccessful.
 
We have
 registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in placean
 active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable toregister
 or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain namesare
 not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  astrademarks or copyrighted material, to others.
8

 From time
 to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.We
 are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item1A:
 Risk Factors” under the captions “The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners,including
 pirated or counterfeit items, may harm our business,” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual propertyrights and face ongoing risk from patent litigation and a
llegations by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”Employees
As
 of December  31, 2019,  we employed approximately 13,300  people  globally. Approximately 6,600  of  our employees were located in theU.S.

Item 1A: RISK FACTORS You
 should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, aswell
 as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  informationregarding risks that affect
 us. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks thatmay affect us. Additi
onal risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors thatadversely affect our business.
Risk Factors That May Affect our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Our
 operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and d
ebt securities.Our operating and financial results have varied
 on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as aresult
 of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or sourceof
 our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operatingresults may not be meaningful, and you should not rely up
on them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantiallyall of our net
 revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues,it is
 also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected inour
 consolidated financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected percentages. Our operating results in one or morefuture quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock and debt securities could
decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described i
n this paragraph and the other risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section.Substantial and increasing
ly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.The
 businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of onlineand
 offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolvingand
 intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services. We compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both buyersand
 sellers to use our platforms. Consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchantshave
 more channels to reach consumers. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competingwith
 each other and our competitors include a number of online and offline retailers with significant resources, large user communities and well-established
 brands.  Moreover,  the  barriers  to  entry  into  these  channels  can  be  low,  and  businesses  easily  can  launch  online  sites  or  mobileplatforms
 and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommercecompanies.
 As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions oracquisitions
 that  may  be  controversial  with  and  lead  to  dissatisfaction  among  sellers,  which  could  reduce  activity  on  our  platform  and  harm  ourprofitability.
We
 face  increased  competitive  pressure  online  and  offline.  In  particular,  the  competitive  norm  for,  and  the  expected  level  of  service  from,ecommerce
 and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buyinggoods,
 lower  (or  no)  shipping  costs,  faster  shipping  times  and  more  favorable  return  policies.  In  addition,  certain  platform  businesses,  such  asAlibaba,
 Amazon,  Apple,  Facebook  and  Google,  many  of  whom  are  larger  than  us  or  have  greater  capitalization,  have  a  dominant  and  secureposition in other
 industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If weare
 unable  to  change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commercemarketplaces,
 particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels (some of which depend on servicesprovided by sellers on our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to chang
es in larger platform businesses, our business will suffer.Competitors
 with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt moreaggressive
 pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Othercompetitors may offer or continue to offer faster and/or
10

free  shipping,  delivery  on  Sunday,  same-day  delivery,  favorable  return  policies  or  other  transaction-related  services  which  improve  the  userexperience
 on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and moreefficiently, and new technologies may incre
ase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.Some
 of  our  competitors  control  other  products  and  services  that  are  important  to  our  success,  including  credit  card  interchange,  Internetsearch, and mobile operating systems.
 Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their productsand services in a manner that impacts our
 competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time totime
 made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable touse
 or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or losecustomers, which could cause our business to suffer.
Consumers
 who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,discount and
 general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their relatedmobile
 offerings,  online and offline  classified  services  and other  shopping channels,  such  as offline  and online home  shopping networks.  In  theUnited
 States, these include, but are not limited to, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Etsy, Shopify, Wayfair, Costco, Rakuten,QVC
 and HSN, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categoriesof products offered on our site.
Consumers
 also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items fromsellers
 of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as websites operated by Schibsted ASA or NaspersLimited
 and others such as craigslist, Oodle.com, Facebook. Consumers also can turn to shopping-comparison sites, such as Google Shopping. Incertain
 markets,  our  fixed-price  listing  and  traditional  auction-style  listing  formats  increasingly  are  being  challenged  by  other  formats,  such  asclassifieds.
Our
 Classifieds platforms offer classifieds listings in a variety of international markets. In many markets in which they operate, our Classifiedsplatforms compete for customers and for advertisers against more established online an
d offline classifieds platforms or other competing websites.We
 use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divertusers
 to  other  online  shopping  destinations.  Consumers  may  choose  to  search  for  products  and  services  with  a  horizontal  search  engine  orshopping
 comparison  website,  and  such  sites  may  also  send  users  to  other  shopping  destinations.  In  addition,  sellers  are  increasingly  utilizingmultiple
 sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites,such as Google, Naver and Baidu.
Consumers
 and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives, including general ecommerce sites, such asAmazon,
 Alibaba, Zalando and Coupang and more specialized sites, such as Etsy. Our international sites also compete for sellers with general andspecialized
 ecommerce sites. Sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels, such as classifieds platforms. Consumers andmerchants
 also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services. In somecountries,
 there  are  online  sites  that  have  larger  customer  bases  and  greater  brand  recognition,  as  well  as  competitors  that  may  have  a  betterunderstanding
 of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  may  increasingly  compete  with  local  competitors  in  developing  countries  that  have  uniqueadvantages, such as a greater ability to operate under loc
al regulatory authorities.In
 addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturersmay
 attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goodsor
 services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to preventdistributors
 from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or drive distributors to sell at prices that would make us less attractive relativeto other alternatives. The adoption by
 manufacturers of policies, or their use of laws or regulations, in each case discouraging or restricting the salesof
 goods or  services  over the  Internet,  could force  our  users  to  stop selling certain  products  on our  platforms,  which could adversely  affect  ourresults of operations and result in loss of market share and diminishe
d value of our brands.11

The principal competitive factors for us include the following:    
•
ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;•
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;•
trust in the seller and the transaction;•
customer service;•
brand recognition;    •
community cohesion, interaction and size;•
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;•
system reliability and security;•
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;•
level of service fees; and•
quality of search tools.We
 may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longeroperating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recog
nition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.Global and regional econ
omic conditions could harm our business.Our
 operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions.  Economic  conditions,  including  inflation,recession, or other adverse economic events or changes, could h
ave a negative and adverse impact on companies and customers with which we dobusiness and
  could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerceplatforms.
 These events and conditions, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’svote
 to  exit  the  European  Union  (known  as  “Brexit”)  and  any  outcomes  resulting  from  that  vote,  could  have  a  negative  and  adverse  impact  oncompanies
 and customers with which we do business or cause us to write down our assets or investments. Because we have global operations,including
 in the United Kingdom and the European Union, we face risks  due to the uncertainty  and the potential  disruptions  surrounding  Brexit,including potential fina
ncial, legal, tax and trade implications.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchang
e rates, which could negatively impact our financial results.Because we
 generate the majority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial resultsare
 impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationallyfocused
 platforms are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from thelocal currency
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreigncurrency
 denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollarstrengthens
 against  foreign  currencies,  particularly  the  euro,  British  pound,  Korean  won  or  Australian  dollar,  our  translation  of  foreign  currencydenominated
 revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. In addition to this translation effect, astrengthen
ing U.S. dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by U.S. sellers to Europe and Australia more than it positivelyaffects
 the  volume of goods being sold by sellers  in those geographies to  buyers  in the United  States,  thereby  further  negatively  impacting  ourfinancial results.
While
 from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict oreliminate
 the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  asignificant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.
Our international operations are subject to increase
d risks, which could harm our business.Our
 international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Korea, and cross-border business from greater China,have
 generated a majority of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreignoperations and expand into intern
ational markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:12

•uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union and anyoutcomes resulting from that vote;
•
uncertainty regarding how the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory andlabor
 environments,  especially  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  European  Union,  will  be  impacted  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  theEuropean Union and any o
utcomes resulting from that vote, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients;•
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transactbusiness
 in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we mayhave limited or no experience;
•
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,language, and cultural differences;
•
stringent local labor laws and regulations;•
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  aparticular currency;
•
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•
import or export regulations;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,as well as U.S. and foreign laws design
ed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•
antitrust and competition regulations;•
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•
payment intermediation regulations;•
local licensing and reporting obligations; and•
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. 
Violations
 of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,or
 sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although wehave
 implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  these  laws,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,contractors,
 or agents will not violate our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doingbusiness internationally an
d could harm our business.Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.
Cross-border
 trade  is  an  important  source  of  both  revenue  and  profits  for  us.  Cross-border  trade  also  represents  our  primary  (or  in  somecases,
 only) presence in certain important markets, such as Brazil, Latin America, China, and various other countries. In addition, our cross-bordertrade is also subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuati
ons.The interpretation and applicatio
n of specific national or regional laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products,selective
 distribution networks, and sellers in other countries listing items on the Internet, and the potential interpretation and application of laws ofmultiple
 jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the buyer, the seller, and/or the location of the item being sold) are often extremely complicated in thecontext
 of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing,selling, shipping, or returning goo
ds across national borders.  
The shipping of goods across nation
al borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty proceduresand
 reviews, including duty-free thresholds in various key markets, the interaction of national postal systems, and security related governmentalprocesses
 at international borders, may increase costs, discourage cross-border purchases, delay transit and create shipping uncertainties. Anyfactors that increase the costs
13

of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harmour business.
Our
 business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users tospend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and app
lications, including increased usage of other websites.Our
 users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:geopolitical
 events, such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity; natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding,wildfires,
 increased  storm  severity,  and  sea  level  rise);  power  shortages  or  outages,  major  public  health  issues,  including  pandemics;  socialnetworking or other entertainment websites or
 mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturing the attention of a large part ofthe population;
 and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert our users from using our websites ormobile applications, our busin
ess could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends to a large degree on our abil
ity to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.Mobile
 devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms throughmobile devices. We may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobil
e and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety oftechnical
 and  other  configurations  across  different  mobile  devices  and  platforms  increases  the  challenges  associated  with  this  environment.  Inaddition,
 a  number  of  other  companies  with  significant  resources  and  a  number  of  innovative  startups  have  introduced  products  and  servicesfocusing on mobile markets.
Our
 ability  to  successfully  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapidly  evolving  market  for  mobile  transactions  is  crucial  to  our  continuedsuccess, and any failure to continuously increas
e the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.If
 we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments or continue to innovate and create new initiatives to provide new programs,products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could d
ecline.Rapid,
 significant  technological  changes  continue  to  confront  the  industries  in  which  we  operate  and  we  cannot  predict  the  effect  oftechnolo
gical changes on our business. We also continuously strive to create new initiatives and innovations that offer growth opportunities, such asour
 new payments and advertising offerings. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of ourcompetitors,
 for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries inwhich
 we  operate  will  continue  to  emerge.  These  new  services  and  technologies  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  wecurrently
 use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures andtake
 considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may beinhibited
 by  industry-wide  standards,  new  laws  and  regulations,  resistance  to  change  from  our  users,  clients  or  merchants,  or  third  parties’intellectual
 property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolvingindustry standards.
Our business is subject to extensive government regulatio
n and oversight.We
 are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumerprotection,
 data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, resale of event tickets,tax,
 antitrust  and  anti-competition,  export  requirements,  anti-corruption,  labor,  advertising,  digital  content,  real  estate,  billing,  ecommerce,promotions,
 quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as wellas laws
 and regulations intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. In addition, we are, or may become, subject tofurther
 regulation in some of the above-mentioned areas or new areas as a result of the continued development and expansion of our paymentscapabilities.
14

Compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies fromjurisdict
ion to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result ofchanges in
 these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractiveto
 our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.We
 have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurancethat our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and reg
ulations or our policies and procedures.  Regulation in the areas of privacy and protectio
n of user data could harm our business.We
 are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our usersaround
 the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  dataprotection
 laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-partytransactions,
 but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercialrelations. These laws continue to devel
op in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.Regulat
ory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a numberof
 privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve overtime,
 both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provideservices
 to our customers that they may find to be valuable. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective inMay
 2018. The GDPR, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the European Union or related to products andservices
 offered  in  the  European  Union,  imposes  a  range  of  new  compliance  obligations  regarding  the  handling  of  personal  data.  The  GDPRimposes
 significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. Ifwe
 fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions,which
 can  result  in  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  worldwide  revenue,  private  lawsuits,  or  reputational  damage.  In  the  U.S.,  California  hasadopted
 the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which provides a new private right ofaction for data
 breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about theirdata
 collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. In addition to the CCPA, severalother
 U.S. states are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Compliance with theGDPR,
 the CCPA, and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming.
 Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to changeour business practices in a manner adverse to our business a
nd violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant penalties.A
 determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communications-based laws could also expose us tosignific
ant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In particular, becauseof
 the enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws that provide a specified monetarydamage award or fine for each violation (such as those descri
bed below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.For
 example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, orTCPA,
 in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers,including but not limited to text messages to mobile pho
nes. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500per violation, whichever is greater, and
 courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-actionlawsuits,
 as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits notcurrently
 alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormousnumber
 of  communications  we send to  our  users,  a determination  that  there  have been violations  of  the  TCPA or  other  communications-basedstatutes could expose us to significant damage aw
ards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post
 on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceivedfailure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regu
latory requirements15

or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, including the GDPR and the CCPA,could
 result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject us to significantpenalties
 and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection,privacy
 and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites,mobile
 platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to thepossibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a vio
lation of these laws.Other laws and regulations could harm our busin
ess.It
 is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,trademarks,
 and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply toour
 businesses.  Many  of  these  laws were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and related  technologies  and,  as a result,  do notcontemplate
 or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do referencethe
 Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these lawsand
 regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  andregulations.
As
 our activities, the products and services we offer, and our geographical scope continue to expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claimor
 hold  that  we  or  our  users  are  subject  to  additional  requirements  (including  licensure)  or  prohibited  from  conducting  our  business  in  theirjurisdiction,
 either generally or with respect to certain actions. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on largecompanies,
 and  regulatory  agencies  may  view  matters  or  interpret  laws  and  regulations  differently  than  they  have  in  the  past  and  in  a  manneradverse
 to  our  businesses.  Our  success  and  increased  visibility  have  driven  some  existing  businesses  that  perceive  us  to  be  a  threat  to  theirbusinesses
 to  raise  concerns  about  our  business  models  to  policymakers  and  regulators.  These  businesses  and  their  trade  association  groupsemploy
 significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. They mayemploy
 these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses andthe
 ability  of  users  to  use  our  products  and  services.  These  established  businesses  have  raised  concerns  relating  to  pricing,  parallel  imports,professional
 seller obligations, selective distribution networks, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and theliability
 of  the  provider  of  an  Internet  marketplace  for  the  conduct  of  its  users  related  to  those  and  other  issues.  Any  changes  to  the  legal  orregulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our li
ability for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.Numerous
 U.S.  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  the  State  of  California,  have  regulations  regarding  “auctions”  and  the  handling  ofproperty
 by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations uponus
 or our users, and others may attempt to do so in the future. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to beincreasing
 and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such asforcing us
 to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,and any of these outcomes could harm our business.
A
 number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws. For example,“trademark
 exhaustion” principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has beenplaced
 on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder’s consent. The application of “trademark exhaustion” principles is largely unsettledin
 the context of the Internet, and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our businesscould be harmed.
As
 we  expand  and  localize  our  international  activities,  we  are  increasingly  becoming  obligated  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  countries  ormarkets
 in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services tousers worldwi
de, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our serversor
 one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we werefound
 liable in France, under French law, for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve French buyers or sellers. Lawsregulating
 Internet, mobile and ecommerce technologies outside of the United States are generally less favorable to us than those in the UnitedStates. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to
16

change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business. Inaddition,
 we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us (e.g., in cross-bordertrade).
 Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans onour services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defen
ding against such actions.We are regularly subject to general litigation, regu
latory disputes, and government inquiries.We
 are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedingsinvolving
 competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment,commercial disput
es, content generated by our users, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries haveincreased
 as our company has grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services haveincreased in complexity.
The
 outcome  and  impact  of  such  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.Regardless
 of  the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  ofmanagement
 resources,  and  other  factors.  Determining  reserves  for  our  pending  litigation  and  other  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-intensiveprocess
 that  is  subject  to  judgment  calls.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  require  us  to  make  substantialpayments to satisfy judgments,
 fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings couldalso result
 in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiringa
 change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any ofthese consequences could
 harm our business.We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competitio
n laws that could adversely impact our business.We
 are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competitionlaws.
 Some  jurisdictions  also  provide  private  rights  of  action  for  competitors  or  consumers  to  assert  claims  of  anti-competitive  conduct.  Othercompanies
 and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of theUnited
 States,  individual  states,  the  European  Union  or  other  countries,  or  otherwise  constitute  unfair  competition.  An  increasing  number  ofgovernments
 are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business partnerships oragreements
 or  arrangements  with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,particularly
 those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practicescould
 be deemed anticompetitive. Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims and investigations,even if
 without foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort andcould result in significant judgments ag
ainst us or require us to change our business practices.Fluctuations in interest rates, and changes in regul
atory guidance related to such interest rates, could adversely impact our financial results.Some
 of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some ofour
 fixed rate debt instruments to floating rates. To the extent that prevailing rates increase, our interest expense under these debt instruments willincrease.
Investments
 in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value ofour
 fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturitiesare
 subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate riskthan
 fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline inmarket
 value  if  interest  rates  increase.  Due  in  part  to  these  factors,  our  investment  income  may  decline  or  we  may  suffer  losses  in  principal  ifsecurities
 are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. In addition, relatively low interest rates limit our investmentincome. Fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost
17

of our current or future indebtedness, cause the market value of our assets to decline or reduce our investment income could adversely affect ourfinancial results.
Our tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks that could harm this business.
Our tickets business, which includes StubHub, is sub
ject to numerous risks, including:•
Some  jurisdictions,  in  particular  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States,  prohibit  the  resale  of  event  tickets  (anti-scalping  laws)  at  pricesabove the face value of the
 tickets or at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing lawsand
 regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users’ ability to continue to use, ourtickets business.
•
Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations.•
In many jurisdictions, our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors, which wemust develop and maintain on acceptab
le terms for our tickets business to be successful.•
Our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting eventsand live entertainment industries.
•
A portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the StubHub platform is processed by StubHub in digital form. Systems failures, securitybreaches,
 theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such sellers’ tickets inventory, could result in significant costs and a loss ofconsumer confidence in our tickets business.
•
Lawsuits  alleging  a  variety  of  causes  of  actions  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  be  filed  against  StubHub  and  eBay  by  venueowners,
 competitors, ticket buyers, and unsuccessful ticket buyers. Such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to changeour business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business.
•
Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies, event organizers,ticket
 brokers, and online and offline ticket resellers. Some ticketing service companies, event organizers, and professional sports teamshave
 begun  to  issue  event  tickets  through  various  forms  of  electronic  ticketing  systems  that  are  designed  to  restrict  or  prohibit  thetransferability
 (and by extension, the resale) of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrictresale
 of  season  tickets  to  a  preferred,  designated  website.  Ticketing  service  companies  have  also  begun  to  use  market-based  pricingstrategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices, and impos
e additional restrictions on transferability, for premium tickets.•
Some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is notaffiliated with, or approved by, such sports teams.
•
To the extent that StubHub holds ticket inventory, we may be exposed to losses associated with such inventory.The
 listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeititems, may harm our business.
The listing or sale by our
 users of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner,has
 resulted  and  may  continue  to  result  in  allegations  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  for  unlawful  activities  against  us  (including  the  employees  anddirectors
 of our various entities) involving activities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, includinggovernment regulators
 and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regardingthe
 sale  of  counterfeit  items,  laws  restricting  or  prohibiting  the  transferability  (and  by  extension,  the  resale)  of  digital  goods  (e.g.,  event  tickets,books,
 music and software), the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, anti-scalping lawswith respect to the resale of tickets, and the sale of items outside of the United States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.
In
 addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatenedand
 actual litigation from time to time by rights owners, including the following luxury brand owners: Tiffany & Co. in the United States; Rolex S.A.and
 Coty Prestige Lancaster Group GmbH in Germany; Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture in France; and L’Oréal SA, LancômeParfums
 et  Beauté  &  Cie,  and  Laboratoire  Garnier  &  Cie  in  several  European  countries.  Plaintiffs  in  these  and  similar  suits  seek,  among  otherremedies, injunctive
 relief and damages. Statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violationand
 $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, and may be even higher in other jurisdictions. In the past, we have paid substantialamounts in connection with resolving certai
n trademark and18

copyright suits. These and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner that increases costs, lowers revenue, makesour
 websites  and  mobile  platforms  less  convenient  to  customers,  and  requires  us  to  spend  substantial  resources  to  take  additional  protectivemeasures
 or  discontinue  certain  service  offerings  in  order  to  combat  these  practices.  In  addition,  we  have  received  significant  media  attentionrelating
 to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand names, and makeusers reluctant to use our products and services.
We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated throug
h our services.Online
 services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  allegingdefamation,
 libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating tothe
 liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the UnitedStates and
 foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputationand our business.
Our
 potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where lawsgoverning
 Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service inany
 jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to thisliability, including exp
ending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increas
e our costs and loss rate.Our
 eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded,have not received the item
 that they purchased or have received an item different from what was described. In addition, as we expand our paymentscapabilities,
 we may be exposed to losses associated with compensating our sellers  for fraudulent  payments.  We expect  to continue to receivecommunications
 from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Ourliabil
ity for these sorts of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is inthe
 United  States.  Litigation  involving  liability  for  any  such  third-party  actions  could  be  costly  and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  managementattention, result in increased costs
 of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affectedusers will likely complain to regulatory ag
encies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.Development
 of our payments system requires ongoing investment, is subject to evolving laws, regulations, rules, and standards, and involvesrisk, including risks related to our dependenc
e on third-party providers.We have invested and plan to continue to invest internal resources into our payments tools in order to
 maintain existing availability, expand intoadditio
nal markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers. If we fail to invest adequate resources into payments on ourplatform,
 or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable, our payments services may not function properly or keep pace with competitiveofferings,
 which  could  negatively  impact  their  usage  and  our  marketplaces.  Further,  our  ability  to  expand  our  payments  services  into  additionalcountries
 is dependent upon the third-party  providers we use to support this service.  As we expand the availability of our payments services toadditional
 markets  or offer new payment methods to our sellers and buyers in the future,  we may become subject to additional regulations andcompliance requirements, and exposed to he
ightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. We
 rely on third-party service providers to perform services related to compliance, credit card processing, payment disbursements, currencyexchange,
 identity verification, sanctions screening, and fraud analysis and detection. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to ourdependence
 on third-party service providers. If any or some of these service providers fail to perform adequately or if any such service providerwere
 to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly, our sellers’ ability to use our platform to receive orders or payments could beadversely affecte
d, which would increase costs, drive sellers away from our marketplaces, result in potential legal liability, and harm our business. Inadditio
n, we and our third-party service providers may experience service outages from time to time that could adversely impact payments made onour
 platform.  Additionally,  any  unexpected  termination  or  modification  of  those  third-party  services  could  lead  to  a  lapse  in  the  effectiveness  ofcertain fraud prevention and detection tools.
19

Our third-party service providers may increase the fees they charge us in the future,  which would increase our operating expenses. This could,in
 turn, require us to increase the fees we charge to sellers and cause some sellers to reduce listings on our marketplaces or to leave our platformaltogether by closing their accounts
. Payments
 are  governed  by  complex  and  continuously  evolving  laws  and  regulations  that  are  subject  to  change  and  vary  across  differentjurisdict
ions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to determine whether various licensingand registration laws relating to payments apply to us an
d to comply with applicable laws and licensing and registration regulations. In addition, therecan
 be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or retain any necessary licenses or registrations. Any failure or claim of failure on the part of theCompany
 or  its  third-party  service  providers  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  payments  could  require  us  to  expendsignificant
 resources,  result  in  liabilities,  limit  or  preclude  our  ability  to  enter  certain  markets  and  harm  our  reputation.  In  addition,  changes  inpayment
 regulations, including changes to the credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets, could adversely affectpayments on our platform and make our payments systems less profitable
. Further,
 we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements pursuant to agreements with ourthird-party
 payment processors. These rules and requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governingelectronic
 funds transfers, are subject to change or reinterpretation, making it difficult for us to comply. Any failure to comply with these rules andcertification
 requirements  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations  to  our  third-party  payment  processors  and  could  result  inpotential
 fines. In addition, changes in these rules and requirements, including any change in our designation by major payment card providers,could requir
e a change in our business operations and could result in limitations on or loss of our ability to accept payment cards, any of which couldnegatively
 impact our business. Such changes could also increase our costs of compliance, which could lead to increased fees for us or our sellersand adversely affect payments on our platform or usage of our payments services and marketplaces.
We
 may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing risks from patent litigation and allegationsby third parties that we are infringing their intellectual pro
perty rights.We
 believe the protection of our intellectual property,  including our trademarks,  patents, copyrights,  domain names, trade dress, and tradesecrets,
 is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the UnitedStates
 and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rightswhen
 offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employeesand contractors and confidentiality agreements with p
arties with whom we conduct business.However, effective intellectual property protection may
 not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available,and
 contractual arrangements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing ormisappropriating
 our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  by  others.Trademark,
 copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. Wemust protect our
 intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and timeconsumin
g and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use ofour
 proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks orcopyright
ed material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failureto adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significa
nt costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.20

Additionally, we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits andhave
 been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because,among other reasons:
•
our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•
we continue to expand into new businesses, including through acquisitions and licenses; and•
the universe of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe theirpatents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such p
atent owners, continues to increase.As
 the number of patent owners and products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and aswe
 acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual propertyrights
 of  others  and  we  may  become  increasingly  subject  to  patent  suits  and  other  infringement  claims,  including  copyright,  and  trademarkinfringement
 claims. Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we arecontractually
 obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us andother
 technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Inaddition,
 we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritoriousor
 not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business,enter
 into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or ceaseconducting certain operations, which w
ould harm our businessThe
 ultimate outcome of any allegation or litigation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any of the claims described above, with orwithout
 merit,  may  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  divert  management’s  time  and  attention  from  our  business,  require  us  to  stopselling,
 delay roll-out, or redesign our products, or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to paysubstantial
 royalty  or  licensing  fees,  or  to  satisfy  indemnification  obligations  that  we  have  with  some  of  our  customers.  Our  failure  to  obtainnecessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intel
lectual property matters, may harm our business.Failure
 to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severelydiminish merchant and consumer confidence i
n and use of our services.We
 face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may nothave received the goods that they
 had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some Europeanand
 Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. Whilewe
 can, in some cases, suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users, we do not have theability to
 require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our buyer protection program, which inthe
 United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee, or as we roll out our new payments capabilities, by compensating our sellers forfraudulent
 payments.  Although  we  have  implemented  measures  to  detect  and  reduce  the  occurrence  of  fraudulent  activities,  combat  bad  buyerexperiences
 and increase buyer satisfaction, including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending theiractivity,
 there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  measures  will  be  effective  in  combating  fraudulent  transactions  or  improving  overall  satisfactionamong
 sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of our services tobuyers
 or sellers, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damage to our reputation, or a diminution in thevalue of our brand names.
We
 have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and we may not generate sufficientcash flow
 from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of ourindebtedness, which could h
ave an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.We have
 a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including underour
 commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities. Our outstanding indebtednessand any additional ind
ebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:21

    •
requiring  us to use a significant  portion  of our cash flow from  operations  and other  available cash to service  our indebtedness,  therebyreducing the amount of cash available for other purpos
es, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions;•
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adversechanges in general economic a
nd industry conditions;•
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;•
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends or other generalcorporate and other purposes may be limited; and
•
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.These risks
 increase as the level of our debt increases. Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness dependsupon
 our  future  performance,  which  will  be  subject  to  general  economic  conditions,  industry  cycles  and  financial,  business  and  other  factorsaffecting
 our results of operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flowfrom operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things:
    
•
incur the tax cost of repatriating funds to the United States;•
seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•
sell selected assets; or•
reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.Such
 measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might notbe available on economic
ally favorable terms or at all.Our
 revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain, and any debtinstruments we enter into in the future may contain, financial and other coven
ants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business andoperatio
ns. If we fail to pay amounts due under, or breach any of the covenants in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the rightto
 demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to grace or cure period). Moreover, any such accelerationand required repayment of or
 default in respect of any of our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments,thereby
 resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect ourliquidity and financial condi
tion.A downgrade in our credit ratings could material
ly adversely affect our business.The
 credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations, financial conditionor
 dispositions and acquisitions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that suchratings
 will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a so-called “watch list” for a possible downgrade orassigned
 a negative ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades inour
 credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, wouldlikely
 increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flowsand could harm our business.
Our business may be subject to sales and other taxes.
The
 application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax (including the “digital servicestax”),
 business  tax  and  gross  receipt  tax  to  ecommerce  businesses  is  a  complex  and  evolving  issue.  Many  of  the  fundamental  statutes  andregulations
 that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clearhow
 existing statutes apply to ecommerce services. In addition, many state and foreign governments are looking for ways to increase revenues,which
 has  resulted  in  legislative  action,  including  new  taxes  on  services  and  gross  revenues  and  through  other  indirect  taxes.  There  are  manytransactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determin
ation is uncertain.22

From time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on ourservices.
 These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful inthe future, which would harm our business.
Similar
 issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex andevolving.
 While we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due, some of our subsidiaries have, from time to time,received
 claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within thevarious countries
 in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of ourunique
 business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one ormore countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.
In
 certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, taxauthorities
 may raise questions about our calculation, reporting and collection of these taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes. Should anynew taxes become applicable to our services or if the taxes we pay are fou
nd to be deficient, our business could be harmed.We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabil
ities.The
 determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and thereare many transactions and calculatio
ns where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subjectto
 tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determination of our taxliability
 is  always  subject  to  audit  and  review  by  applicable  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities,  and  we  are  currently  undergoing  a  number  ofinvestigations,
 audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our business structure. Any adverse outcomeof any
 such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statementsand
 may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reservesbased on assumptions and estimates that we beli
eve are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In
 addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of ourdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, oraccounting principles, as well as certai
n discrete items.In
 light of continuing fiscal challenges in certain U.S. states and in many countries in Europe, various levels of government are increasinglyfocused
 on  tax  reform  and  other  legislative  action  to  increase  tax  revenue,  including  corporate  income  taxes.  A  number  of  U.S.  states  haveattempted
 to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes andother
 direct  business  taxes  on  companies  that  have  no  physical  presence  in  their  state,  and  taxing  authorities  in  foreign  jurisdictions  may  takesimilar actions. Many
 U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to theirstate
 from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe, and elsewhere in the world, there are various tax reform efforts underway designedto
 ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Companies that operate over the Internet, such as eBay, are atarget
 of some of these efforts. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that do not have a physicalpresence in their respective jurisdictions, this coul
d increase our effective tax rate.Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-ke
eping obligations.The
 application of sales tax and other indirect taxes on cross border sales by remote sellers is continuing to change and evolve. On June 21,2018,
 the U.S. Supreme Court decided South  Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al,  a case challenging the current law under which online retailers are notrequired
 to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer’s state. This decision allows states to adopt new or enforceexisting
 laws  requiring  sellers  to  collect  and  remit  sales  and  use  tax,  even  in  states  in  which  the  seller  has  no  presence.  The  adoption  orenforcement of
 any such legislation could result in a sales and use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers. This collection responsibilityand the additional costs associate
d with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens forbuyers
 and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms and could harm our business. Moreover, the application of such taxes on our commerceplatforms could cause a marketplace to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers, which co
uld adversely impact our business, financial23

performance, and growth. The majority of U.S. states have enacted laws or have pending legislation that require marketplace facilitators to collectand remit sales tax for some or all sellers using these marketplaces.
Similar laws imposing tax collection resp
onsibility on foreign sellers are being considered in other countries as well. We are now jointly liable forU.K.
 VAT and German VAT for certain sellers who fail to fulfill their VAT obligations unless we suspend their eBay activity until the seller resolvesthe matter with the corresponding VAT authority. Other jurisdictions are consideri
ng similar legislation.Multiple
 jurisdictions have enacted laws which require marketplaces to report user activity or collect and remit taxes on certain items sold onthe marketplace. For
 example, we are collecting Australian GST on certain imports into Australia and remitting the GST to the Australian Tax Office.The
 European Union has also adopted a VAT reform package which starting in 2021 requires marketplaces such as eBay to collect and remit VATon most imports from outside the European Union.
One
 or  more  states,  the  U.S.  federal  government  or  foreign  countries  may  seek  to  impose  reporting  or  record-keeping  obligations  oncompanies
 that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance or if oneof our
 companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates. Certain of our companiesare
 required to report to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and most states on customers subject to U.S. income tax if they reach certainpayment
 thresholds. As a result, we are required to request tax identification numbers from certain payees, track payments by tax identificationnumber
 and,  under  certain  conditions,  withhold  a portion  of  payments  and forward  such  withholding  to  the  IRS.  These  obligations  can increaseoperational
 costs and change our user experience. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties andother
 sanctions and could harm our business. Imposition of an information reporting requirement could decrease seller or buyer activity on our sitesand would harm our business.
We
 have periodically received requests from tax authorities for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites,and
 in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records forall
 or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that are imposed onus
 but not on alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from or prosecute sellers or buyers, coulddecrease activity on our sites and harm our business.
Our business is subject to online security risks, includin
g security breaches and cyberattacks.Our
 businesses involve the storage and transmission of users’ personal financial information. In addition, a significant number of our usersauthorize
 us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us or, in certain cases, third-party  serviceproviders
 utilized  in  our  payment  services.  An  increasing  number  of  websites,  including  those  owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offlinecompanies,
 have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of theirwebsites
 or  infrastructure.  The  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable,  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems,  changefrequently,
 may  be  difficult  to  detect  for  a  long  time,  and  often  are  not  recognized  until  launched  against  a  target.  Certain  efforts  may  be  statesponsored
 and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may be even more difficult to detect. As a result, wemay
 be unable to anticipate  these techniques  or  to implement  adequate preventative  measures.  Unauthorized  parties  may also attempt  to  gainaccess to our
 systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceivingour
 employees,  contractors  and  temporary  staff.  A  party  that  is  able  to  circumvent  our  security  measures,  or  those  of  our  third-party  serviceproviders,
 could misappropriate our or our users’ personal information, cause interruption or degradations in our operations, damage our computersor
 those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties usingfraudulent
 “spoof”  and  “phishing”  emails  to  misappropriate  user  names,  passwords,  payment  card  numbers,  or  other  personal  information  or  tointroduce
 viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our users’ computers. Our information technology and infrastructure may bevulnerable
 to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card datathat
 are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similareffects.
In
 May  2014,  we  publicly  announced  that  criminals  were  able  to  penetrate  and  steal  certain  data,  including  usernames,  encrypted  userpasswords and other non-financial us
er data. Upon making this announcement, we required24

all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in order to log into their account. The breach and subsequent password reset havenegative
ly impacted the business. In July 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from thebreach. The lawsuit was dismissed with leav
e to amend. In addition, we have received requests for information and became subject to investigationsregarding this incident from numerous regulatory and other gov
ernment agencies across the world.We
 may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.These
 issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of markets where we operate. Additionally, our insurancepolicies
 carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able tofully collect, if at all, under these insurance polici
es.Systems
 failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  the  performance  of  our  websites,applications, products or services could harm our busin
ess.Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to of hardware a
nd software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service
 and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommun
ications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject tobreak-ins,
 sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  notsufficient for all eventualities.
We
 have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks and other events or conditions from timeto
 time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications, including our payments services.These
 events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or otherfunctionality
 of our websites and mobile applications or payments services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptionsin our services could cause current or potential users to believ
e that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoidour sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and bran
ds. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damagesto
 our  customers  or  their  businesses,  these  customers  could  seek  significant  compensation  from  us  for  their  losses  and  those  claims,  even  ifunsuccessful,
 would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by thirdparties
 and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or thesethird
 parties cease to provide the services or facilities. In particular, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility that weuse
 could cause system interruptions  and delays, result in loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions  in our services. We do not carrybusiness interrupt
ion insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failuresand similar events.
The
 closing of the proposed sale of StubHub is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with expectedplans or on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and the pen
ding sale may be disruptive to StubHub.As previously announced, on Nov
ember 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell StubHub.The sale is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020. 
The completion, on our expected timeline, of the propose d sale of StubHubis
 subject to closing conditions and viagogo’s ability to obtain debt and equity financing on a timely basis. If  the conditions to the closing of the saleof
 StubHub are neither satisfied nor, where permissible, waived on a timely basis or at all, we may be unable to complete the sale of StubHub orsuch
 completion  may  be  delayed  beyond  our  expected  timeline. We  are  also  subject  to  risks  regarding  the  failure  of  the  buyer  to  obtain  thenecessary
 financing to complete the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement and risks related to the equity and debt financingand related guarantee arrangements entered i
n connection with the stock purchase agreement. Whether
 or  not  the  proposed  sale  of  StubHub  is  completed,  the  announcement  and  pendency  of  the  StubHub  sale  may  be  disruptive  toStubHub
 and may adversely affect StubHub’s relationships with current and prospective employees and business partners and buyers and sellerson its platform. Uncertainties related to the pending sale of
25

StubHub may impair StubHub’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could divert the attention of StubHub’s management andother
 employees from its day-to-day business and operations in preparation for and during the sale. If we are unable to effectively manage theserisks, StubHub’s business, results of operations, financia
l condition and prospects would be adversely affected.If the proposed sale of
 StubHub is delayed or not completed for any reason, including due to the inability to satisfy the closing conditions or dueto
 the buyer’s inability to obtain the necessary financing or industry or economic conditions outside of our control, investor confidence could declineand
 we  could  face  negative  publicity  and  possible  litigation.  In  addition,  in  the  event  of  a  failed  transaction,  we  will  have  expended  significantmanagement
 resources in an effort to complete the sale and, although in some circumstances the buyer may be obligated to pay us a terminationfee
 of $200 million, will have incurred significant transaction costs. Accordingly, if the proposed sale of StubHub is not completed on the terms setforth
 in the stock purchase agreement or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be adverselyaffected.
Acquisitions,
 dispositions, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harmour business or impact our financial results.
We
 have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products, disposed of significantbusiness
es (including PayPal and our Enterprise business in 2015), and in November 2019 we have entered into an agreement to sell our StubHubbusiness
 to viagogo. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall businessstrategy,
 including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as wellas strategic investments and joint ventures.
These transactions may involve significant cha
llenges and risks, including:•
the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,following and continui
ng after announcement of our transaction plans;•
declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result fromchanges
 in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposedbusiness;
•
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;•
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,integration and administration;
•
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;•
the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrativesystems),
 technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costlyprocess;
•
the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  andexpenditures that may arise as a result;
•
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  toacquisition
 may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicablelegal and other standards;
•
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;•
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claimsor
 disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in thecase
 of dispositions, liabilities to the acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties andindemnities;
•
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third-party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which inand of itself may require regulatory approval and or additi
onal controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and•
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processesand
 the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statementsor make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.
26

At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any ofthese
 transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it may take us longer than expected to fullyrealize
 the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all,which
 could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operating  results.  Any  acquisitions  or  dispositions  may  also  require  us  to  issue  additional  equitysecurities, spend our
 cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operatio
ns and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.    
We
 have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management andoperatio
nal control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent withours, and
 business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm toour
 reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture. Our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks.Any
 circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adversely affect the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action orlawsuits in connection with our investments, coul
d harm our business or negatively impact our financial results.We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that entitles us to acquire a fixed number ofshares
 of the Adyen’s common stock subject to certain milestones being met. This warrant is accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASCTopic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging .  Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of thiswarrant. We report
 this warrant on a quarterly basis at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the fair value of this warrant arerecogniz
ed in our consolidated statement of income. Fluctuations in Adyen’s common stock or other changes in assumptions could result in materialchanges
 in the fair value that we report in our consolidated balance sheets and our consolidated statement of income, which could have a materialimpact on our financial results.
We
 are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the strategic review of our asset portfolio, as well as the execution of our plan for operatingefficiency.
In
 March  2019,  we  announced that  we  initiated,  with  the  assistance  of  external  financial  advisors,  a strategic  review  of  our  asset  portfolio,including
 but not limited to StubHub and eBay Classifieds Group. In November 2019,  as an outcome of our strategic review, we entered into anagreement
 to sell our StubHub business to viagogo. Our strategic review efforts continue, however, there can be no assurance that the strategicreview
 will result  in  any  further  sale,  spin-off  or  other  business  combination  involving  our  assets.  We  will incur  expenses  in  connection  with  thereview
 and our future results may be affected by the pursuit or consummation of any specific transaction or other strategic alternative resulting fromthe
 strategic review. While this review is ongoing, we are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties, including retaining and attracting employeesduring
 the  review  process;  the  diversion  of  management’s  time  to  the  review;  and  exposure  to  potential  litigation  in  connection  with  the  reviewprocess
 or any specific transaction or other strategic alternative resulting therefrom, all of which could disrupt and negatively affect our business.Speculation
 regarding  any  developments  related  to  the  review  of  strategic  alternatives  and  perceived  uncertainties  related  to  the  future  of  theCompany could cause our stock
 price to fluctuate significantly. There is no finite timetable for completion of the strategic review, and we can provideno
 assurance  that  any  transaction  or  other  strategic  alternative  we  pursue  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  our  results  of  operations  or  financialcondition.
In addition, we announced that our operati
ng review has resulted in a three-year plan for operating efficiency, which is expected to enhance ouroperating margins and create capacity for reinvestment initiatives. The ex
ecution of this plan is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and therecan be no assurance that we will be abl
e to achieve the anticipated results of this plan.Our
 success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,and
 develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm ourbusiness.
Our
 future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including keyengineering
 and product  development  personnel,  and our  ability  to attract,  retain,  and motivate  key personnel.  Competition  for  key personnel  isintense, especially in the Silic
on Valley where our corporate27

headquarters  are  located,  and  we  may  be  unable  to  successfully  attract,  integrate  or  retain  sufficiently  qualified  key  personnel.  In  makingemployment
 decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards theywould
 receive  in  connection  with  their  employment  and  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  may  make  it  more  difficult  to  attract,  retain  and  motivateemployees.
 In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” lifeinsurance
 policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified seniormanagement and other key personnel, could h
arm our business.On September 25, 2019, we announced the ap
pointment of an interim Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors is actively undertaking asearch for our next Chief Executive Officer. This search and any eventual transition to a Chi
ef Executive Officer may result in disruptions to ourbusiness and uncertainty among investors, employ
ees and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any such disruptions anduncertainty, as well as a delay or failure in successfully i
dentifying, attracting or retaining a permanent Chief Executive Officer, could have anadverse effect on our business and financial resu
lts.Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide servic
es to us or to our sellers could harm our business.A
 number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,merchant
 tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shippingproviders
 that  deliver  goods  sold  on  our  platform,  among  others.  Financial  or  regulatory  issues,  labor  issues  (e.g.,  strikes,  lockouts,  or  workstoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers cou
ld harm our business.Price
 increases by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clientscould
 also reduce the number of listings on our platforms  or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions,  thereby harming ourbusiness.
 Some third parties who provide services to us or our sellers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to uswithout
 competitive constraint. While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance theirshipping
 experience, postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers’ offerings, and postal service changes could requirecertain sellers
 to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on oursites, thereby harming our business.
We
 have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which arecritical
 to  our  operations.  If  our  service  providers  do  not  perform  satisfactorily,  our  operations  could  be  disrupted,  which  could  result  in  userdissatisfaction and could harm our business.
There
 can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or atall.
 If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our sellers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may beunable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner an
d on acceptable terms, or at all.Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party develop
ers, subject us to additional risks.We
 provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed toallow
 them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-partydevelopers
 will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors couldcause
 such  third-party  developers  to  curtail  or  stop  development  for  our  platforms.  In  addition,  our  business  is  subject  to  many  regulatoryrestrictions.
 It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatoryrestrictions and we may be held responsible for such vio
lations, which could harm our business.We cannot provide assurance that we will contin
ue to pay dividends on our common stock. 
In
 January  2019,  we  initiated  a  quarterly  cash  dividend  on  our  common  stock.  The  timing,  declaration,  amount  and  payment  of  any  futuredividends
 fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, working capital, financialcondition,
 results of operations, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments, applicable law and other considerations that our Board ofDirectors considers relevant. A
28

reduction  in  the  amount  of  cash  dividends  on  our  common  stock,  the  suspension  of  those  dividends  or  a  failure  to  meet  market  expectationsregarding
 potential  dividend  increases  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock.  If  we  do  not  pay  cashdividends
 on our common stock in the future, realization of a gain on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely on the appreciation ofthe price of our common stock, which may not occur.
 
We could incur significant liabil
ity if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.We
 have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that our distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal toour
 stockholders on July 17, 2015 (the “Distribution”) qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the InternalRevenue
 Code. The opinion relies  on certain  facts,  assumptions,  representations  and undertakings  from  PayPal and us regarding  the past  andfuture
 conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings areincorrect
 or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant taxliabilities.
 Notwithstanding  the  opinion  of  tax  counsel  we  have  received,  the  IRS  could  determine  on  audit  that  the  Distribution  is  taxable  if  itdetermines
 that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with theconclusions
 in the opinion. If the Distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject toU.S. federal income tax and we could incur signific
ant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a resu
lt of the Distribution.We
 entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  therelationship
 of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal.  The indemnity  rights  we have against PayPal under  the agreements  may  not be sufficient  to  protect  us. In addition,  our indemnityobligations to PayPal may be sign
ificant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 1B:

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES     We
 own  and  lease  various  properties  in  the  U.S.  and  31  other  countries  around  the  world.  We  use  the  properties  for  executive  andadministrative
 offices, data centers, product development offices, fulfillment centers and customer service offices. Our headquarters are located inSan
 Jose, California and occupies approximately 0.5 million square feet. Our owned data centers are solely located in Utah. As of December  31,2019
, our owned and leased properties provid ed us with aggregate square footage as follows (in millions): 
United States   Other Countries  Total Owned facilities
1.3  —  1.3 Leased facilities
0.8  3.9  4.7 Total facilities
2.1  3.9  6.0 From time to time we consider various alternatives related to our long-term facilities needs. While w
e believe that our existing facilities, whichare used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate to meet our immediate ne
eds, it may become necessary to develop and improve land thatwe own or lease or acquire addition
al or alternative space to accommodate any future growth.30

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate of the reasonably possible loss or
 range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of lossesarising
 directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Item 3, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued  for  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  for  which  we  believe  a  loss  is  probable  were  not  material  for  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2019.  Except  as  otherwise  noted  for  the  proceedings  described  in  this  Item  3,  we  have  concluded,  based  on  currently  availableinformation,
 that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  orsettlement)
 in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable andsubject
 to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations,
 the  impact  on  our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  material.  Legal  fees  are  expensed  asincurred.
General Matte
rsThird
 parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Weare subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be sub
ject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our businessas
 our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/oragainst
 our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposureto
 such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past beenforced
 to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, theLanham
 Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of therange of products and services that we offer and
 our geographical operations) and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying lawswith
 respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuitsalleging that we have violate
d patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, aretime
 consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enterinto costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorab
le terms.From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules,
 policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,prices,
 rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  andregulatory
 landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products andservices
 that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatoryactions
 against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages forcertain
 causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significa
nt amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significantoperational resources or otherwise harm our business.
31

Indemnification ProvisionsWe
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the un
ique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.To
 date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant,either individually or
 collectively.ITEM 4:

PART IIITEM
 5: MARKET  FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITYSECURITIES
        Common Stock
Our
 common  stock  has  been  traded  on  The  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  under  the  symbol  “EBAY”  since  September  24,  1998.  As  ofJanuary
 27, 2020,  there were approximately 3,524 holders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are a significantly largernumber of beneficial owners of our common stock.
Dividend Policy
During
 2019, the company paid a total of $473 million  in  cash dividends. In January 2020, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 pershare
 of common stock to be paid on March 20, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2020. The timing, declaration, amount and paymentof
 any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, workingcapital,
 financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  capital  requirements,  covenants  in  our  credit  agreement,  applicable  law  and  other  businessconsiderations

In  January 2018 our Board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program and in January 2019 our Board authorized an additional $4.0  billion stock  repurchaseprogram. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under ourstock
 repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchasetransactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
During
 the  three  months  ended December  31,  2019,  we  repurchased  approximately $1.0  billion of  our  common  stock  under  our  stock  repurchase  program.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2019,  a total of approximately $2.2  billion remained  available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. DuringJanuary 2020, our Board authorized an additional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.
We
 expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, ourstock
 repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety offactors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Business
eBay Inc., a global commerce leader, includes Marketplace, Stub
Hub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, eBay connects millions of buyersand
 sellers  around  the  world,  empowering  people  and  creating  opportunity  for  all.  Founded  in  1995  in  San  Jose,  California,  eBay  is  one  of  theworld’s
 largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our technologies and services are designed to givebuyers choice and a
 breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime andanywhere. In 2019,
 eBay enabled over $90 billion  of Gross Merchandise Volume. Presentation
In addition to
 the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measuresin reviewing our financial results.
 The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-GAAP
 financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-Neutral
 information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information providedbelow
 in  “Non-GAAP  Measures  of  Financial  Performance,”  which  includes  reconciliations  of  FX-Neutral  financial  measures  to  the  most  directlycomparable
 GAAP  measures.  We  calculate  the  year-over-year  impact  of  foreign  currency  movements  using  prior  period  foreign  currency  ratesapplied to current year transactional currency amounts.
Our
 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, Britishpound,
 Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the factthat
 we  generate  a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  internationally,  including  during  the  years  ended  December  31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  we aresubject to the risks related to doing business in foreign co
untries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”The
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2019 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar againstthe euro, British pound and Korean won.
Fiscal Year Highlights
Net
 revenues  increased 1%  to $10.8  billion in 2019 compared  to 2018 ,  primarily  driven  by  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  andClassifieds
 marketing services and other revenues. FX-Neutral net revenue (as defined above) increased 2%  in 2019 compared to 2018 . Operating margin increased to 
21.5%  in 2019 compared to 20.7%  in 2018. 37

We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion  in 2019 compared to $2.7 billion  in 2018, ending the year with cash, cash equivalents and non-eq
uity investments of $3.8 billion . In
 the first quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of the U.K. based classifieds site, Motors.co.uk for $93 million in cash. During thethird quarter of 2019, $400 
million of floating rate notes and $1.15 billion of 2.200% fixed rate notes matured and were repaid. During the year endedDecember 31, 2019 we paid 
$473 million  in cash dividends. In
 the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell StubHub to viagogo for a purchase price of $4.05 billion in cash.The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approva
l and closing conditions.Diluted earnings per
 share from continuing operations was $2.10  in 2019 compared  to diluted earnings per share of $2.55  in 2018. In January 2020,
 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock to be paid on March 20, 2020 to stockholders of record as ofMarch 2, 2020.

, 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. The hedging activity in net revenues specifically relates to hedges of net transaction revenues generated by ourMarketplace segment. Foreign currency
 movements relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of $211 million , a favorable impact of $174 million
 and  unfavorable impact of $39 million  on  net revenues for the years December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. The effect of foreigncurrency
 exchange rate movements in 2019  compared  to 2018  was  primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro,British pound
 and Korean won. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily  attributable to theweakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British p
ound and Korean won.39

Net Revenues by Type and SegmentWe generate two types of net revenues:
Net
 transaction revenues primarily  include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellerson
 our Marketplace platforms and final value fees from sellers and buyers on our StubHub platforms. Our net transaction revenues alsoinclude
 store  subscription  and  other  fees  often  from  large  enterprise  sellers.  Our  net  transaction  revenues  are  reduced  by  incentives,including discounts, coupo
ns and rewards, provided to our customers.Marketing
 services and other ("MS&O") revenues  consist of Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds revenues principally from the saleof advertisements, classifieds fees, revenue sharing arrangements an
d first-party inventory programs.The following table presents net revenu

Key Operating Metrics
Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net transaction revenues.
GMV
 consists  of the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace or StubHub platforms during theapplicable
 period,  regardless  of  whether  the  buyer  and  seller  actually  consummated  the  transaction.  Despite  GMV’s  divergence  fromrevenue
 during 2019, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow throughour platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the i
nclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.Take rate
 is defined as net transaction revenues divide d by GMV.40

Marketplace  net transaction revenues were net of $81  million,  $8 million and $28  million hedging  activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Marketplace
 net transaction revenues increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees and a higher takerate. Marketplace transaction take
 rate was higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with finalvalue
 fees are calculated as a percentage of an item’s sale price, and category mix. The increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2019compared
 to  2018  was  due  to  take  rate  considerations  discussed  above,  despite  declining  Marketplace  GMV.  We  expect  that  the  divergencebetween
 Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  and  Marketplace  GMV  will  continue.  Despite  GMV’s  divergence  from  net  transaction  revenuesduring
 the year, we still believe the metric provides a useful measure of overall volume of closed transactions that flow through the platform in agiven period.
The increase
 in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in Marketplace GMV and afavorable
 impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Marketplace transaction take rate was higher in 2018 compared to2017,
 primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final value fees are calculated as a percentage of an items sale price, and adecrease in seller incentives, partially offset by a decreas
e in revenues from final value fees attributable to pricing and category mix.StubHub Net Transaction Revenues

StubHub net transaction revenues in 2019 compared to 2018  decreased  slightly primarily driven by lower GMV from concerts and theater,partially
 offset  by  an  increase  in  sporting  events  and  a  slightly  higher  take  rate.  The  slight  increase  in  StubHub  transaction  take  rate  in  2019compared to 2018 was primarily due to pricing chan

**Not meaningful Marketplace MS&O Revenues
The
 decrease in Marketplace MS&O revenues during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenues thatwas
 driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are recognized in net transaction revenues and lower revenues resulting from thesale of brands4friends. These decreases were partia
lly offset by increases in first-party inventory program in Korea in 2019 compared to 2018.The
 increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to ourfirst-party inventory program in Korea and revenue sharing arrangements, particul
arly shipping, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenuesthat was driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are reco
gnized in net transaction revenues.Classifieds MS&O Revenues
The
 increases in Classifieds MS&O revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 and in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increasedrevenue from our Classifieds horizontal and vertical motors platforms primarily in Germany.
StubHub MS&O Revenues
The
 increase in StubHub MS&O revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to growth in revenues from first-party inventory salesfrom sporting events. The change in StubHub MS&O revenue in 2
018 compared to 2017 was relatively flat.42

Cost of Net RevenuesCost
 of  net  revenues  primarily  consists  of  costs  associated  with  customer  support,  site  operations,  costs  of  goods  sold  and  paymentprocessing.
 Significant components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment andamortization
 expense,  first  party  inventory  costs,  bank  transaction  fees,  and  credit  card  interchange  and  assessment  fees.  The  following  tablepresents cost of net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

23.2 %    22.2 %    22.4 %The increase in cost of
 net revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in site operationand
 payment processing costs as we increased our investments in our business, and an increase in costs of goods sold driven by our first-partyinventory program in Korea.
 
Cost
 of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $56 million attributable to foreign currency movementsrelative
 to the U.S. dollar in 2019 compared to 2018. Cost of net revenues was unfavorably impacted by $34 million attributable to foreign currencymovements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2018. There was no hedg

 Operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by $68 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2018compared to 2017. There was no hedging activ
ity within operating expenses in 2019 and 2018.43

Sales and Marketing 
Sales
 and  marketing  expenses  primarily  consist  of  advertising  and  marketing  program  costs  (both  online  and  offline),  employeecompensation,
 certain  user  coupons  and  rewards,  contractor  costs,  facilities  costs  and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Online  marketing  expensesrepresent
 traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline advertising primarilyincludes brand campaigns an
d buyer/seller communications.The
 decrease  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  a  favorable  impact  from  foreign  currencymovements
 relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases in offline advertising spend and employee-related costs. These costs were partially offset byonline marketing spend and user cou
pons and rewards largely driven by our Japan platform acquired in the second quarter of 2018. The
 increase in sales and marketing expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in user coupons and rewards andtraffic acquisition costs.
Product Development
 
Product
 development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment.Product
 development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  product  development  efforts,  including  thedevelopment
 and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include payment intermediation capabilities and improvedseller tools and buyer experiences bu
ilt on a foundation of structured data.Capitalized internal
 use and platform development costs were $137 million  and $147 million  in 2019 and 2018 ,  respectively, and are primarilyreflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
The decrease in
 product development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs, foreigncurrency
 movement relative to the U.S. dollar and depreciation on equipment. The increase in product development expenses in 2018 compared to2017 was primarily due to an increase in empl
oyee-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on equipment.General and Administrative
 
General and administrative expenses primarily co
nsist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment,employer
 payroll  taxes  on  stock-based  compensation,  legal  expenses,  restructuring,  insurance  premiums  and  professional  fees.  Our  legalexpenses, including those relate
d to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019
 compared to 2018 was primarily due to severance costs incurred in 2019 relatedto our CEO transition.
The
 increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to restructuring costs related to our globalworkforce
 reduction and an increase in employee-related costs. For additional details related to the restructuring, refer to “Note 18 – Restructuring”to the consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report.  
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision
 for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, fraud and baddebt
 expense  associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  We  expect  our  provision  for  transaction  losses  to  fluctuate  depending  on  manyfactors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regul
atory changes.The
 increase  in  provision  for  transaction  losses  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  bad  debt  expense.  Theincrease in provision for transaction losses in 20
18 compared to 2017 was not significant.44

 increase in income from operations in 2019 compared 2018 was primarily due to an increase in income from our Marketplace segment.Income
 from  our  StubHub  and  Classifieds  segments  was  not  a  significant  contributor  to  the  increase  in  total  income  from  operations  in  2019compared
 to 2018. The decrease in income from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to global workforce reduction and anincrease in employee related costs, partially offset by an increas
e in income from our Marketplace and Classifieds segments.Interest and Other, Net
 
Interest
 and  other,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  earned  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  investments,  as  well  as  foreign  exchangetransactio
n gains and losses, gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from Adyen, our portion of operating results frominvestments
 accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  investment  gain/loss  on  acquisitions  or  disposals  and  interest  expense,consisting
 of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interestexpense

 increase in interest and other, net in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the $313 million gain recognized on the sale ofour

e in fair value of the warrant.45

Income Tax ProvisionThe following table presents provisi
on for income taxes (in millions, except percentages): 
Year Ended December 31,  
2019   2018   2017 Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 415  $190  $3,288 Effective tax rate
18.8 %  7.0 %  144.5 % The
 increase  in our  effective  tax  rate  in 2019 compared  to  2018 was primarily  due to  a reduction  in 2018 to  the  provisional  tax  amountsrecorded
 in 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment inGiosis
 that  was  not  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  on  a  current  basis  that  did  not  recur  in  2019,  and  certain  expenses  in  2019  including  anegotiat
ed reduction in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our Classifieds platforms. These impacts were partially offset in 2019 by the effectivesettlements
 of audits, reduction in the U.S. deferred tax liability for minimum tax on foreign earnings, related to the above reduction in tax basis ofintangible assets, and a benefit due to the en
acted New York state legislation regarding the taxability of foreign earnings.The
 decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $3.1 billion provisional tax charge related to the TaxCuts
 and Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”) recorded in 2017. In 2018, as we completed our analysis of U.S. tax reform, we recorded a $463million reduction to
 the provisional tax amounts recorded in 2017.  Further, the 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by U.S. tax reform andthe gain
 recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in Giosis in the second quarter 2018 that is not subject to U.S.federal income tax on a current basis.
On
 December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal income taxrate from 35% to
 21% beginning in 2018, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriationof
 unremitted  foreign  earnings  in  2017  and  created  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  recognized  a  provisionalincome
 tax charge of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidatedstatement
 of  income.  We  completed  our  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  U.S.  tax  reform  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2018 and recognized  a $463 millionreduction
 to the provisional tax amounts  recorded in the fourth  quarter of 2017, which is included as a component of income tax expense fromcontinuing operations in
 2018.Included
 in the 2017 provisional amount was $1.4 billion for the income tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. Wecompleted
 the computation of this amount as part of the 2017 income tax return filing and reduced the provisional amount by $18 million and weutilized $213 million of foreign tax credits to reduce the n
et liability, both in 2018.The
 remaining  provisional  amount  of  $1.7  billion  was  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.minimum tax
 on foreign earnings, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreignearnings. We completed our analysis of the components of the deferred tax computatio
n in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a tax benefit of$445
 million as a reduction to the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the deferred income tax effects of the Act. Thisamount
 includes  a  $389  million  tax  benefit  as  a  result  of  clarification  by  Swiss  tax  authorities  regarding  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  torepatriated earnings in October 2018.
As
 a result of U.S. tax reform, our earnings in foreign jurisdictions are taxed at substantially the same rate as the U.S. federal statutory taxrate of 21%. 
In 2017, our provision for income taxes differed from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarilydue
 to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The impact on our provision for incometaxes
 of foreign income being taxed at different rates that the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $217 million in 2017. Theforeign
 jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in 2017 include Switzerland. See“Note 15 - Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements inclu
ded in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.46

From time to time we engage in certain intercompany transactions. We consider many factors when evaluating these transactions. Thesetransactions
 may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. The impact in any period may be significant. These transactionsare complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.
We
 are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have beenreserved
 for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given theinherent
 uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing ofthese
 adjustments. However, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. See “Note 15 – Income Taxes” to theconsolidated financial statements inc
luded in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  we  use  FX-Neutral
 net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financialresults.
 We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-yearimpact
 of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excludinghedging activity.
These
 non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  bedifferent
 from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set ofaccounting
 rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results ofoperations
 as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction withthe corresponding GAAP measures.
These
 non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospectsfor
 the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding theforeign
 currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we havehistorically
 reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in ourfinancial reporting.

Cash provided by continuing operating activities of 
$3.1 billion  in 2019  was primarily attributable to net income of $1.8 billion  with adjustments of 
$681 million in  depreciation and amortization, $505  million in  stock-based compensation, $300  million in  provision for transaction losses, $117 million
 for  deferred income taxes, $52 million  loss  on the sale of a business, partially offset by a decrease of $200 million  in  changes in assets andliabilities, net of acquisition effects, and 
$133 million  for changes in the fair value of the Adyen warrant. Cash
 provided by continuing operating activities of $2.7 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to net income of $2.5 billion with adjustmentsof
 $696  million  in  depreciation  and  amortization,  $538  million  in  stock-based  compensation  and  $286  million  in  provision  for  transaction  losses,partially

04 million for changes in fair value of the Adyen warrant.The
 net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of changes in assets andliabilities,
 net  of  acquisition  effects,  and  a  net  loss  of  $1.0  billion  offset  by  adjustments  of  $1.7  billion  in  deferred  income  taxes,  $676  million  indepreciation and amortization and $
483 million in stock-based compensation.Cash paid for
 income taxes in 2019 , 2018 and 2017  was $333 million , $597 million and $308 million , respectively. Cash  paid for income taxesin
 2018 included tax payments related to our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under U.S. tax reform of $168 million, including aprepayment of $72 million.
Investing Activities
Cash provided
 by investing activities of $2.8 billion  in  2019 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $50.5 billion  from  the maturities and salesof
 investments, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $47.0 billion ,  property and equipment of $554 million , equity investment in Paytm Mall of $160 million and acquis
itions of $93 million . Cash provided by
 investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $30.9 billion from the maturities and salesof
 investments and $1.0 billion from the sale of equity investment in Flipkart, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $28.1billion, property and equipment of $65
1 million and acquisitions of $302 million.The
 net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2017 was primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666 million andcash paid for our equity investment in Flipkart of $514 millio
n.The
 largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  ourinvestments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase a
nd sale activity will fluctuate.49

Financing ActivitiesCash used
 in financing activities of $7.1 billion  in  2019 was primarily used to repurchase $5.0 billion  of  common stock, repay outstanding debtof 
$1.6 billion and pay $473 million  of cash dividends. Cash
 used in financing activities of $5.4 billion in 2018 was primarily used to repurchase $4.5 billion of common stock and repay $750 millionof our outstanding senior notes.
The net cash used in financing activiti
es of $1.8 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $2.7 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and$1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstandi
ng debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.The
 negative effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S.dollar
 against other currencies, primarily the Korean won, euro and British pound during 2019. The negative effect of exchange rate movements oncash,
 cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro, Korean wonand
 British pound, during 2018. The positive effect  of exchange rate movements  on cash, cash equivalents and restricted  cash was due to theweakening of the U.S. dollar against other currenci
es, primarily the euro and Korean won, during 2017.Stock Repurchases
In
 January 2018, our Board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program and in January 2019, our Board authorized an additional $4.0billion
 stock  repurchase  program.  These  stock  repurchase  programs  have  no  expiration  from  the  date  of  authorization.  Our  stock  repurchaseprograms
 are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any sharerepurchases
 under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions(including
 accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will befunded from our working capital or other financing alternativ
es.During 
2019 ,  we repurchased approximately $5.0  billion of  our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December  31,2019
,  a total of approximately $2.2 billion  remained  available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. InJanuary 2020, our Board authorized an ad
ditional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.We
 expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  ourcommon
 stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actualnumber
 of  shares  repurchased  will  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  corporate  and  regulatory  requirements,  price  and  other  marketconditions and management’s determin
ation as to the appropriate use of our cash.  Dividends
The company paid a total of 
$473 million  in cash dividends during the year end ed December 31, 2019 . No cash dividends  were paid in 2018and 2017. In January 2020, we declared a cas
h dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock to be paid on March 20, 2020 to stockholders ofrecord as of March 2, 2020.
Shelf Registration Statement and Debt
As
 of December  31, 2019,  we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allowsus to
 issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest inshares
 of  preferred  stock,  purchase  contracts  and  units  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  offerings.  Each  issuance  under  the  shelf  registrationstatement
 will  require  the  filing  of  a  prospectus  supplement  identifying  the  amount  and  terms  of  the  securities  to  be  issued.  The  registrationstatement
 does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions andother factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compli
ance with the covenants in our credit agreement.50

Senior NotesAs
 of December  31, 2019,  we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion .  The netproceeds
 from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures,share
 repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and afterMarch
 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000%  fixed  rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, at aredemptio
n price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or allof
 the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plusaccrued
 and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixedrate
 notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000%fixed
 rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to101% of
 the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. For additional details related to our senior notes, please see “Note 10 – Debt” to theconsolidated financial statements inc
luded in this report.To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion  of  the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBankOffered
 Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed ratesenior notes resulting from changes in
 interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as $1.15 billion related toour
 2.200%  senior  notes  of  the  $2.4  billion  aggregate  notional  amount  matured.  In  addition,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  weterminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% sen
ior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes dueJuly
 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as anincrease to the long-term debt balance and is being recogn
ized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. Thegain
 recognized  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019  was  immaterial.  For  additional  details  related  to  the  interest  rate  swap  termination,please see, “Note 10 – Debt” to the consolidated fina
ncial statements included in this report.The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith respect to specified properties, and also inclu
des customary events of default.Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof
 up to $1.5  billion outstanding  at any time with maturities of up to 397  days from the date of issue. As of December  31, 2019,  there were nocommercial paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In
 November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2  billion five-year  revolving credit facility. We mayalso,
 subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amountof 
$1 billion.  Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and othergeneral corporate purposes.
As
 of December  31, 2019,  no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion  credit  agreement. However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5 billion  commercial  paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion  of  available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in orderto repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are una
ble to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,$500 million
 of borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2019  for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans
 under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent
 to 1.5  percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5  percent or LIBOR plus 1.0 percent, plus a
 margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero  percent to 0.5  percent. The credit agreement will terminate and allamounts owing thereunder will be d
ue and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request51

or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity dateis
 extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,affirmative
 and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  Thenegative
 covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.The
 financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximumconsolidated
 leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect tous.
We were in compliance with all covena
nts in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2019 . Credit Ratings
As
 of December  31, 2019,  we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
 rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  FitchRatings,
 Inc. (long-term  rated BBB, short-term  rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of oursources
 of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actionstaken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings wil
l likely increase our borrowing costs. Commitments and Contingencies
We
 have  certain  fixed  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  include  future  estimated  payments  for  general  operating  purposes.Changes
 in  our  business  needs,  contractual  cancellation  provisions,  fluctuating  interest  rates,  and  other  factors  may  result  in  actual  paymentsdiffering
 from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes ourfixed contractual obligations and commitments (in milli
ons):Payments Due During the Year Ending December 31,
  Debt    Leases   Purchase Obligations  Total 2020
  $1,257  $200  $140  $1,597 2021

  4,349  78  3  4,430  
  $10,674   $746  $296  $11,716 The significant assumptions used in our determin
ation of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•
Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. For additional details related to our debt,please
 see  “Note  10  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report.  This  table  does  not  reflect  any  amountspayable
 under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstandingas of 
December 31, 2019 . •
Lease amounts include payments for our operating and finance leases for office space, data centers, as well as fulfillment centers andother
 corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and arenot
 expected  to  differ  significantly  from  actual  results  under  our  existing  leases,  unless  a  substantial  change  in  our  headcount  needsrequires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office faci
lity early.•
Purchase  obligation  amounts  include  minimum  purchase  commitments  for  advertising,  capital  expenditures  (computer  equipment,software
 applications,  engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  theordinary course of business.
As
 we  are  unable  to  reasonably  predict  the  timing  of  settlement  of  liabilities  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  net,  the  table  does  notinclude $285 million of such n
on-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated52

balance sheet as of December  31, 2019.  The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected to be reduced within the next twelve months isapproximately
 $19 million. See “Note 15 – Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information onunrecognized tax benefits.
Liquidity and Capital Resou
rce RequirementsAs
 of December  31, 2019 and December  31, 2018,  we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term
 non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $3.8 billion  and $8.6 billion ,  respectively. As of December  31, 2019,  this amount includedassets
 held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $3.4  billion.  As we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required topay
 income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.
We
 actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety ofprincipal
 and  secondarily  on  improving  yield  on  these  assets.  We  diversify  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  investments  among  variouscounterparties
 in  order  to  reduce  our  exposure  should  any  one  of  these  counterparties  fail  or  encounter  difficulties.  To  date,  we  have  notexperienced
 any material  loss or lack of access  to our invested cash,  cash equivalents  or short-term  investments;  however, we can provide noassurances
 that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financialmarkets.
 At any point  in time  we have funds  in our operating  accounts  and customer  accounts  that  are  deposited and invested  with third  partyfinancial institutions.
We
 believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generatedfrom
 operations,  borrowings  available  under  our  credit  agreement  and  commercial  paper  program,  and  our  access  to  capital  markets,  will  besufficient
 to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, repayment of debt, stock repurchases and dividends for the foreseeablefuture.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
December 31, 2019 ,  we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2019 , we  had a total of $4.8 billion  in  aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.7 billion in cash withdrawals, held within the fin
ancial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and oth
er branding elements to the53

extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnificationfor
 intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to ourlimited
 history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recordedin our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provis
ions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
General
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions thataffect
 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have basedour
 estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich
 form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Oursenior management has discussed the deve
lopment, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
An accounting policy is considered to be
 critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that arehighly
 uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accountingestimates
 that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the followingcritical
 accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.The
 following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financialstatements and related notes and other disclosures incl
uded in this report.Revenue Recognition
We
 may  enter  into  certain  revenue  contracts  that  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  goods  or  services  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 We also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment issometimes
 required  to  determine  the  appropriate  accounting  for  these  transactions  including:  (1)  whether  services  are  considered  distinctperformance
 obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of eachdistinct
 performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as anagent);
 (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized asrevenue
 or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing oramount of revenue recognition.
Income Taxes
Our
 annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions inwhich
 we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.Significant
 judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  tax  expense  and  in  evaluating  our  tax  positions,  including  evaluating  uncertainties  and  thecomplexity
 of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions
 are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome
 tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred
 tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation ofdeemed
 repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at thebalance sheet date.
Deferred
 tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arisebecause
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and taxcredit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverabil
ity of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxableincome from all sources,
54

including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of incomerely
 heavily  on  estimates  that  are  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  our  historical  experience  and  short-range  and  long-range  businessforecasts.
 As  of December  31,  2019,  we  had  a  valuation  allowance  on  certain  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  based  on  ourassessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
We
 recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,pursuant to which we only recognize the tax
 benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination
 by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements fromsuch
 positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimatesettlement.
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.GAAP
 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings inthe quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest an
d penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We
 file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain taxposition
 is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolutionof
 any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, aswell
 as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require theuse of cash.
The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 :  
Year Ended December 31,  
2019  2018  2017  
(In millions, except percentages) Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 415  $190  $3,288 Effective tax rate
18.8 % 7.0 % 144.5 % Our
 future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutoryrates
 and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  orliabil
ities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examinationof
 our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the ade
quacy of our provision for income taxes.Based
 on  our  results  for  the  year  ended December  31,  2019,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  apercentage
 of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $22  million,  resulting in anapproximate 
$0.03  change in diluted earning s per share.Goodwill and Intangible As
setsThe
 purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business withthe
 residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgmentsand
 estimates.  These  judgments  can  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cash  flows  that  an  asset  is  expected  to  generate  in  the  future  and  theappropriate weighted average cost of capita
l.As
 of December  31,  2019,  our  goodwill  totaled $5.2  billion and  our  identifiable  intangible  assets,  net  totaled $67  million.  We  assess  theimpairment
 of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may notbe
 recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore
 likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value.  If  the  reporting  unit  does  not  pass  the  qualitativeassessment,
 then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using marketand
 discounted  cash  flow  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Thediscounted cash flow approach uses ex
pected future operating results. The market55

approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. Failure to achieve theseexpected
 results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test ofgoodwill
 as of August 31, 2019  and 2018 .  As of December  31, 2019,  we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for anyreporting units was required. See “Note 4 – Goodwil
l and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.Legal Contingencies
In
 connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, andprovided
 for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of thefacts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are sub
ject to change based upon new information and future events.From
 time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involvedin
 legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  12  –  Commitments  andContingencies”
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims againstus,
 and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could requiresignificant
 amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certainclaims,
 we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting asignificant
 part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.
Recent Accounting Pronoun
cementsSee "Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Acco
unting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report,regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronou
ncements on our consolidated financial statements.56

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk
We
 are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events(including
 volatility  or  distress  in  the  equity  and/or  debt  or  credit  markets)  may  impact  regional  and  global  financial  markets.  These  events  andconditions,
 including  uncertainties  and  instability  in  economic  and  market  conditions  caused  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  the  EuropeanUnion and any outcomes resulting from
 that vote, could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility thatmay result from adverse economic conditions and events or changes i
n interest rates.The
 primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk.To
 achieve  this  objective,  we  maintain  our  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  in  a  variety  of  asset  types,  including  bank  deposits,government bonds
 and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 24%  of our total cash and investments was held in cashand
 cash equivalents. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, the fair market values of our fixed ratesecurities
 may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that havedeclined in market value due to chang
es in interest rates. 
As
 of December  31,  2019,  the  balance  of  our  corporate  debt  and  government  bond  securities  was $2.8  billion,  which  representedapproximately 
67%  of  our  total  cash  and investments.  Investments  in both  fixed-rate  and floating-rate  interest-earning  instruments  carry  varyingdegrees
 of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.In
 general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating ratesecurities
 generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected ifinterest
 rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment incomemay
 fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interestrates.
 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of $8 millionand $44 million as of 
December 31, 2019  and 2018, respectively. As
 of December  31, 2019,  we had an aggregate principal amount of $7.8  billion of  outstanding senior notes, of which 95%  bore interest atfixed
 rates.  In  2014,  we  entered  into  $2.4  billion  of  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  had  an  economic  effect  of  modifying  the  fixed  interestobligations associated with $
1.15 billion of our 2.200% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021, and $500million
 of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus aspread.
 In July 2019, $1.15 billion of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured. In addition, during the third quarter of 2019, we terminatedthe interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021 and $500 mil
lion of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024,which
 were designated as fair value hedges. As a result of the early termination hedge, accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain ontermination
 was recorded as an increase to the long-term debt balance and is being recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as areduction to interest expense. The gain recogniz
ed during the year ended December 31, 2019 was immaterial. Further
 changes  in  interest  rates  will  impact  interest  expense  on  any  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facility,  which  bear  interest  atfloating
 rates,  and  the  interest  rate  on  any  commercial  paper  borrowings  we  make  and  any  debt  securities  we  may  issue  in  the  future  and,accordingly,
 will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 10 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.
 
Equity Price Risk
Equity Investments
Our equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held compani
es. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a componentof interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounti
ng. Equityinvestments without readily determinable fair valu
es are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable pricechanges obtained from orderly transactions for identical or simil
ar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the equityinvestment are recognized in interest and other, net. As of 
December 31, 2019 , our equity 57

investments totaled $355 million , which represented approximately 9%  of our total cash and investments, and were primarily related to equityinvestments without readily determinable fair valu
es.Warrant
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrantis
 accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equityvolatility
 may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  value  of  the  warrant.  As  of December  31, 2019,  a one dollar  change in Adyen’s  common  stock,holding
 other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrant by approximately $1 million. For additional details related tothe warrant, please see “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financ
ial statements included in this report.Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily theeuro,
 British pound, Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. Wetransact
 business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our internationalsubsidiaries
 for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operationsand certain of our
 intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we mayrecord significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuati
ons and related hedging activities.We
 have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  theseexposures
 and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through thepurchase
 of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts isat
 times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 7– Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report.We
 use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreigncurrency
 exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.Most
 of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or lossis
 initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the sameperiod
 the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s gainor loss is recognized immediately in earning
s in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cashflow hedge accounting.
The
 following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and net investmenthedges,
 and the before-tax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of December  31,2019
.  The  sensitivity  for  foreign  currency  contracts  is  based  on  a  20%  adverse  change  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  against  relevant  functionalcurrencies.

 our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes inthe value of the underlying exposure.
We
 also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other thanthe
 functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movementson our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency

gains  and  losses  on  the  assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  in  interest  and  other,  net,  which  are  offset  by  the  gains  and  losses  on  the  foreignexchange contracts.
We
 considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  inexchange
 rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  onincome before income taxes of approximately $18 milli
on as of December 31, 2019  taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in place as of 
December 31, 2019 . ITEM 8:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockho
lders of eBay Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Cont
rol over Financial ReportingWe
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and therelated
 consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31,
 2019, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2019
 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal controlover
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  ofDecember
 31,  2019  and  2018,  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2019  inconformity
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,effective internal control o
ver financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issuedby the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the con
solidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for Opinions
The Company’s
 management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits
 assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our re
sponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates)
 (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rulesand regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial repor
ting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,evidence
 regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weaknessexists,
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performingsuch other procedures as we cons
idered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, o
r disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.F-1

Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter 
communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated to the audit co
mmittee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii) involved our especially challenging, s
ubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on thecritical audit matter or on
 the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Income Taxes
As described in Notes 1 and 15 to the con
solidated financial statements, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and inevaluating management’s tax pos
itions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. As disclosed by management, theCompany’s income tax rate 
is affected by the tax rates that apply to their foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit derived from the amortizat
ion of the Company’s intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred tax benefit may from time to t
ime change based on changes in tax rates. Management recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordancewith generally accepted ac
counting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, pursuant to which management only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain taxposition if it is mo
re likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The total provision for inco
me taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $415 million, and the effective tax rate was 18.8%.The principal considerat
ions for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are there is significant judgmentapplied by management when determin
ing the tax expense and in evaluating management’s tax positions, including analyzing uncertain tax positions and taxeson foreign earnings, which 
in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidencerelating to income taxes.
Addressing the matter invol
ved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements. These procedures included te
sting the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including controls over uncertain tax positions and theprovision for income taxe
s. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating tax positions taken by management, including evaluating thereasonableness of management’s determ
ination of the probability of sustaining the position under tax examination, evaluating communications with the relevanttax authorities, testing appl
icable tax rates applied by management, and evaluating the impact of taxes on foreign earnings./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay
 Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose,California,
 eBay  is  one  of  the  world’s  largest  and  most  vibrant  marketplaces  for  discovering  great  value  and  unique  selection.  Collectively,  weconnect
 millions of buyers and sellers around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity for all. Our technologies and services aredesigned
 to give buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale,virtually anytime and anywhere. 
When
 we refer to “we,” “our,” “us” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) andits consolidated subsidiaries, un
less otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.In
 the first quarter of 2019, we announced several organizational changes, including bringing our Marketplace geographic regions togetherunder
 one global leadership team. We changed from one  reportable segment to three  reportable  segments to reflect the way management and ourchief
 operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  review  and  assess  performance  of  the  business.  Our three  reportable  segments  are  Marketplace,StubHub
 and Classifieds. Marketplace includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite ofmobile
 apps.  StubHub  includes  our  online  ticket  platform  located  at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobileapps.
 Classifieds  includes  a  collection  of  brands  such  as  Mobile.de,  Kijiji,  Gumtree,  Marktplaats,  eBay  Kleinanzeigen  and  others.  Prior  periodinformation
 has been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation. For further information on our segments, refer to “Note 5 –Segments” to our consolidated financial statements inc
luded in this report.On
 November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion ,  subject tocertain adjustme
nts. The completion, on our expected timeline, of the proposed sale of StubHub is subject to closing conditions and viagogo’s abilityto
 obtain debt and equity financing on a timely basis, both of which have not been met as of December 31, 2019. If the conditions to the closing ofthe
 sale of  StubHub  are  neither  satisfied  nor,  where  permissible,  waived  on a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  we  may  be  unable  to  complete  the  sale  ofStubHub
 or such completion may be delayed beyond our expected timeline. Given the uncertainty, we have determined as of December 31, 2019the
 transaction  is  not  considered  probable  to  close.  As  such,  StubHub  continues  to  be  classified  as  held  for  use  in  our  December  31,  2019consolidated financial statements. 
Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requiresmanagement
 to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets andliabilities at the date of the consolidate
d financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On anongoing
 basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenuerecognition,
 stock-based  compensation,  investments,  goodwill  and  the  recoverability  of  intangible  assets.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historicalexperience
 and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  thoseestimates.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-ownedsubsidiaries
 and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  beeneliminated
 in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidationrequirement
 for VIEs. Investments in entities where we hold at least a 20%  ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence,but not
 control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investees’ resultsof operations is included in interest and oth
er, net and our investment balance is included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where wehold less than a 
20%  ownershipF-9

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
interest
 are generally accounted for as equity investments to be measured at fair value or, under an election, at cost if it does not have readilydeterminable
 fair  value,  in  which  case  the  carrying  value  would  be  adjusted  upon  the  occurrence  of  an  observable  price  change  in  an  orderlytransaction for identical or similar instruments or impairment.
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue recognition
We
 recognize revenue when we transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequentlyremitted to governmental authorities.
Net transaction revenues
Our
 net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers inour Marketplace and final value fees
 from sellers and buyers on our StubHub platforms. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscriptionand other fees often from large enterprise sellers. Our net transaction revenues are reduced by ince
ntives provided to our customers.We
 identified one performance obligation to sellers on our Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on our secure andtrusted
 Marketplace  platforms.  Final  value  fees  are  recognized  when  an  item  is  sold  on  a  Marketplace  platform,  satisfying  this  performanceobligation.
 There may be additional services available to Marketplace sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings, that are not distinct within thecontext
 of the contract. Accordingly, fees for these additional services are recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promotedlisting
 fees are recognized when the item is sold and feature and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires. Onour
 StubHub platform, our performance obligation extends to both buyers and sellers. We made the policy election to consider delivery of tickets inour
 StubHub platform to be fulfillment activities and, consequently, the performance obligation is satisfied, and final value fees are recognized, uponpayment to sellers.
Store
 subscription  and  other  nonstandard  listing  contracts  may  contain  multiple  performance  obligations,  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 Determining  whether  performance  obligations  should  be  accounted  for  separately  or  combined  may  require  significant  judgment.  Thetransaction
 price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). In instances where SSP is not directlyobservable,
 we generally estimate selling prices based on when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography. These estimates aregenerally
 based on pricing strategies, market factors, strategic objectives and observable inputs. Store subscription revenues are recognized overthe
 subscription  period,  and  discounts  offered  through  store  subscription  or  nonstandard  listing  contracts  are  recognized  when  the  options  areexercised or when the options expire.
Further, to
 drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts onitems
 sold,  coupons  and  rewards.  Evaluating  whether  a  promotion  or  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  may  require  significant  judgment.Promotions
 and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue isrecognized
 or when we pay or promise to pay the incentive. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom wehave
 no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, we may provide credits to customers when we refundcertain
 fees.  Credits are accounted for as variable consideration  at contract  inception when estimating  the amount of revenue to be recognizedwhen
 a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of  revenue  will  not  occur  and  updated  asadditional information
 becomes available.Marketing services and other revenues
Our
 marketing  services  and other  revenues  are derived principally  from  the sale of advertisements,  classifieds  fees,  and revenue sharingarrangements.
 Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on “impressions” (i.e., the numberof times that an
 advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platformsclick
 through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) delivered to advertisers. We use the output method and apply the practicalexpedient to recognize advertising reve
nue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. For contractsF-10

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
with
 target advertising commitments with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration to the extent it is probable that asignificant reversal of revenue will not occur.
We
 generate net revenues related to fees for listing items on our Classifieds platforms, which are recognized over the estimated period of theclassifieds
 listing and fees to feature the listing that are recognized over the feature period or a point in time depending on the nature of the featurepurchased. Discounts offered through purchase of packa
ges of multiple services are allocated based on the SSP of each respective feature.Revenues related to
 revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on whether we are the principal and are responsible for fulfilling thepromise
 to  provide the specified  services  or whether  we are  an agent arranging  for  those services  to  be provided by our  partners.  Determiningwhether
 we are a principal or agent in these contracts may require significant judgment. If we are the principal, we recognize revenue in the grossamount of consideration received from the
 customer, whereas if we are an agent, we recognize revenue net of the consideration due to our partnersat
 a point in time when the services are provided. Our most significant revenue share arrangements are with shipping service providers. We areprimarily acting as an
 agent in these contracts and revenues are recognized at a point in time when we have satisfied our promise of connecting theshipping service provider to our customer.
Refer to “Note 5 – Segments” for further information, including revenue by types and geogra
phical markets.Contract balances  
Timing
 of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers.  Accounts receivable represents amounts invoiced andrevenue
 recognized  prior  to  invoicing  when  we  have  satisfied  our  performance  obligation  and  have  the  unconditional  right  to  payment.  Theallowance
 for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience,the
 age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances,  current  economic  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  our  customers’  ability  to  pay.  Theallowance
 for  doubtful  accounts  and  authorized  credits  was $128  million and $106  million as  of December  31,  2019 and December  31,  2018, respectively.
Deferred revenue
 consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally short-term
 duration  of  contracts,  the  majority  of  the  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  in  the  following  reporting  period.  The  amount  of  revenuerecognized
 for the twelve  months  ended December  31, 2019 that  was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was$93 million
.  The amount of revenue recognized for the twelve  months ended December 31, 2018  that  was included in the deferred revenue balanceat the beginning of the period was 
$96 million . Internal use software and platform development costs
Direct
 costs incurred to develop software for internal use and platform development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimateduseful
 life of one  to five years. During the years ended December  31, 2019 and 2018 ,  we capitalized costs, primarily related to labor and stock-based
 compensation, of $137 million  and $147 million ,  respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $150 million , $160 millionand 
$156  million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platformdevelopment are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense
We
 expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements inthe
 period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses arerecognized based on the terms of
 the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions deliveredover
 the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertisingexpense totaled 
$1.4 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion  for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. F-11

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Stock-based compensation
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units,  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  We  primarily  issue  RSUs.  We  determinecompensation
 expense  associated  with  RSUs  based  on  the  fair  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  We  determine  compensationexpense
 associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generallyrecognize
 compensation  expense  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method  over  the  respective  vesting  period  for  awards  that  are  ultimatelyexpected
 to  vest.  Accordingly,  stock-based  compensation  expense  for 2019 , 2018 and 2017  has  been  reduced  for  estimated  forfeitures.  Whenestimating
 forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. We recognize a benefit or provisionfrom
 stock-based compensation in earnings as a component of income tax expense to the extent that an incremental tax benefit or deficiency isrealized by following the orderin
g provisions of the tax law.Provision for transaction losses
Provision
 for  transaction  losses  consists  primarily  of  losses  resulting  from  our  buyer  protection  programs,  fraud  and  bad  debt  expenseassociated
 with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  Provisions  for  these  items  represent  our  estimate  of  actual  losses  based  on  our  historicalexperience and many other factors including ch
anges to our protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as economic conditions.Income taxes
Significant judgment is required in d
etermining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and thecomplexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions qu
arterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty bas
ed on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on forei
gn earnings. The deferred taxbenefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based o
n the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. 
We
 account  for  income  taxes  using an  asset  and liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  thecurrent
 year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statementsor
 tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of futurechanges in
 tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefitsthat are not expected to be realized based on avai
lable evidence.We
 report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Werecognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unreco
gnized tax benefits in income tax expense.Cash and cash equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, whichmay include bank deposits, US Treasury securities, time depos
its, and certificates of deposit.Investments
Short-term investments are
 investments with original maturities of less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-sale andare
 reported  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method.  Short-term  investments  are  primarily  comprised  of  corporate  debt  securities,commercial paper, and agency securities.
Long-term
 investments are primarily comprised of corporate debt securities, agency securities, and equity investments. Debt securities areclassified as available-for-sale an
d are reported at fair value using the specific identification method.F-12

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Unrealized
 gains  and  losses  on  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as  a  component  of  othercomprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or be
nefits.Our
 equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. We account for equity investments through which we exercisesignificant
 influence  but  do  not  have  control  over  the  investee  under  the  equity  method.  Our  consolidated  results  of  operations  include,  as  acomponent
 of  interest  and  other,  net,  our  share  of  the  net  income  or  loss  of  the  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  ofaccounting.
 Our share of investees’ results of operations is not significant for any period presented. Our equity investments not accounted for underthe
 equity method are carried at under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at costminus
 impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the  identical  or  a  similarinvestment of the same issuer. Such changes in the basis of the equity investment are recog
nized in interest & other, net.We
 periodically perform impairment assessment review of our debt and equity investments. For debt securities, this assessment takes intoaccount
 the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required tosell the security before recovery of
 its amortized cost basis, and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is,whether
 a credit loss exists). If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the security to its fair value and record thecorresponding
 charge as interest & other, net. For equity investments we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize animpairment if there
 are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in interest& other, net.
Leases
We
 determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating and finance lease liabilities are recognized based onthe
 present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicitin
 the lease is not readily determinable for our operating leases, we generally use an incremental borrowing rate based on information available atthe
 commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and finance lease assetsare
 generally recognized based on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to ten years
,  some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years ,  and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year
. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single leasecomponent for our data center leases. Lease and non-le
ase components for all other leases are accounted for separately.Operating
 leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidatedbalance
 sheets.  Finance  leases  are  included  in  property  and  equipment,  net,  short-term  debt,  and  long-term  debt  on  our  consolidated  balancesheet.
Property and equipment
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation  for  equipment,  buildings  and  leaseholdimprovements
 commences once they are ready for our intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful
 lives  of  the  assets,  generally, one  to three years  for  computer  equipment  and  software,  up  to thirty  years  for  buildings  and  buildingimprovements, the shorter of 
five  years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and three  years for furniture, fixtures and vehicles. Land is not depreciated.

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
 is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed todetermine
 whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not passthe
 qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimatedusing
 income  and  market  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Thediscounted
 cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. Themarket
 approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entitiesor mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricin
g metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of our reporting units. Failureto
 achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reportingunit.
 We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2019  and 2018  and determined  that no adjustment to the carrying valueof goodwill for any reporting units was required. 
Intangible
 assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,including
 patents and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line methodand estimated useful lives ranging from 
one  to five years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assets
We
 evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that thecarrying
 amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscountedfuture net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , no impairment was noted. Foreign currency
 
Most
 of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  local  currency  of  their  respective  countries  as  their  functional  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  aretranslated
 into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  averageexchange
 rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component ofaccumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest an
d other, net.Derivative instruments
We
 use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, options and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.We
 may also use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Wedo not use derivative financial instruments for trading purpos
es. We
 also  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  addition  to  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5%  of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrantis accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 81
5, Derivatives and Hedging . See “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments” for a full description of our derivative instrument activities and relate
d accounting policies.F-14

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Concentration of credit risk
Our
 cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash andcash
 equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived fromrevenue earned from
 customers. In each of the years ended December 31,  2019, 2018 and 2017,  no customer accounted for more than 10% of netrevenues.
 Our  derivative  instruments  expose  us  to  credit  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  counterparties  may  be  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  theagreements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In
 2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  new  guidance  related  to  accounting  for  leases.  The  new  guidancerequires the
 recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previousguidance.
 We  adopted  this  guidance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019  using  the  modified  retrospective  approach,  electing  the  package  of  practicalexpedients,
 and  the  practical  expedient  to  not  separate  lease  and  nonlease  components  for  data  center  operating  leases.  We  also  elected  theoptional
 transition method that permits adoption of the new standard prospectively, as of the effective date, without adjusting comparative periodspresented. Adoption of the standard resulted in the recog
nition of $728 million  of ROU assets and $744 million  of lease liabilities  on our consolidatedbalance sheet
 at adoption related to office space, data and fulfillment centers, and other corporate assets. The difference of $16 million  represented deferred
 rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of right-of-use assets. The adoption ofthe standard on January 1, 2019 did not have a material imp
act on our consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows.In
 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to theearliest
 call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing. The new guidance will not impact debt securities held at adiscount. Adoption
 of this standard was made on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earningsas
 of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, includinginterim
 reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of the standard in the first quarter of 2019 did not have a materialimpact on our consolidated financia
l statements at adoption.In
 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions  by expanding thescope of
 ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ,  to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services fromnonemployees.
 Under  the  new  standard,  most  of  the  guidance  on  stock  compensation  payments  to  nonemployees  would  be  aligned  with  therequireme
nts for share-based payments granted to employees. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,2018, including
 interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of the standard in the first quarter of 2019 did not havean impact on our consolidated financi
al statements.In
 2018,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  to  permit  use  of  the  Overnight  Index  Swap  (“OIS”)  rate  as  a  U.S.  benchmark  interest  rate  for  hedgeaccounting
 purposes  in  addition  to  the  UST,  the  London  InterBank  Offered  Rate  (“LIBOR”)  swap  rate,  the  OIS  rate  based  on  the  Fed  FundsEffective
 Rate, and the Securities Industry and Financial Market Association Municipal Swap Rate. This guidance is effective for annual reportingperiods
 beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of the standardin the first quarter of 2019 did not have a material impact on our consolidate
d financial statements at adoption.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented atthe
 net  amount  expected  to  be  collected,  not  based  on  incurred  losses.  Further,  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  should  berecorded
 through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The new standard is effective forfiscal
 years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard impacts the Company’s accounting forallowa
nces for doubtful accounts, available-for-sale securities and other assets subject to credit risk. In preparation for the adoption of this standard,we
 will update our credit loss models as needed. The Company has completed its analysis of the impact of this guidance and the adoption of thisstandard will not have a material impact on our consol
idated financial statements.F-15

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In
 2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  removing  the  requirement  to  perform  ahypothetical
 purchase price allocation to compute the implied fair value of goodwill to measure impairment. Instead, any goodwill impairment willequal
 the  amount  by  which  a  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  not  to  exceed  the  carrying  amount  of  goodwill.  Further,  theguidance
 eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if itfails
 that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairmenttest in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect the ad
option of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.
In
 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloudcomputing
 arrangement that is hosted by the vendor (i.e., a service contract). Under the new guidance, customers will apply the same criteria forcapitalizing
 implementation  costs  as  they  would  for  an  arrangement  that  has  a  software  license.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reportingperiods
 beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard will not havea material impact on our consolidated financi
al statements.In
 2018,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  clarify  the  interaction  between  Collaborative  Arrangements  and  Revenue  from  Contracts  withCustomers
 standards.  The  guidance  (1)  clarifies  that  certain  transactions  between  collaborative  arrangement  participants  should  be  accountedunder
 revenue guidance; (2) adds unit of account guidance to the collaborative arrangement guidance to align with the revenue standard; and (3)clarifies

 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principlesand
 also simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition ofenactment of

Note 2 – Net Income (loss) Per Share
Basic
 net  income  (loss)  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  commonshares
 outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weightedaverage
 number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstandingoptions and equity
 incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation ofdiluted net income (loss) per share excludes all a
nti-dilutive common shares.The following table presents the computatio

In
 the first quarter of 2019, we announced several organizational changes, including bringing our Marketplace geographic regions togetherunder
 one global leadership team. We changed from one  reportable segment to three  reportable  segments to reflect the way management and ourchief
 operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  review  and  assess  performance  of  the  business.  Our three  reportable  segments  are  Marketplace,StubHub
 and Classifieds. Marketplace includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite ofmobile
 apps. StubHub includes our online ticket platform  located at www.stubhub.com,  its localized counterparts  and the StubHub mobile apps.Classifieds
 includes a collection of brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. The accounting policiesof our segments are the same as those described in “Note 1 – The Company and S
ummary of Significant Accounting Policies”. Prior period segmentinformation has been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentati
on.Our
 reportable segments reflect the way management and our CODM review and assess performance of the business. Our CODM reviewsrevenue
 and  operating  income  (loss)  for  each  reportable  segment.  Our  CODM  does  not  evaluate  reportable  segments  using  asset  information.Corporate
 and other costs includes: (i) corporate management costs, such as human resources, finance and legal, that are not allocated to oursegments;
 (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) restructuring charges; (iv) stock-based compensation; and (v) results of operations of variousinitiatives that support all of our reportable segments.

 cash is held primarily in interest bearing accounts for letters of credit primarily related to our global sabbatical program and variouslease
 arrangements.  Our  fixed-income  investments  consist  of  predominantly  investment  grade  corporate  debt  securities  and  government  andagency
 securities. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on theircredit ratings from the major rating agencies.
The
 longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interestrates
 increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  tochanges
 in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitativeand
 quantitative criteria. We presently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value ofall these investments upon maturity or sale.

es.Note 7 – Derivative Instruments
Our
 primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currencyexchange
 rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate andinterest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We
 use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  andliabilities,
 including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one  month to one  year in duration, butwith
 maturities up to 24  months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cashflows
 are  not  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  ourforeign exchange contracts designated as cas
h flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis.We
 used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.These
 interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion  of  these notes so that theinterest
 payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a spread. There were no interest rate swaps outstandingas of December 31, 2019.

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Cash Flow Hedges
For
 derivative  instruments  that  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially  reported  as  a  component  ofaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  income  (“AOCI”)  and  subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  hedgedtransaction
 affects  earnings.  Derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  must  be  de-designated  as  hedges  when  it  is  probable  theforecasted hedg
ed transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains andlosses in AOCI associated with such derivati
ve instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings.  As of December 31, 2019 , we have estimated that
 approximately $2  million of  net derivative loss related to our cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income will bereclassified
 into  earnings  within  the  next  12  months.  We  classify  cash  flows  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  as  operating  activities  in  ourconsolidated statement of cash flows.
Net Investment Hedges
For
 derivative instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in the translationadjustments
 component  of  AOCI  and  is  reclassified  to  net  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  the  hedged  subsidiary  is  either  sold  or  substantiallyliquidated.
Fair Value Hedges
We
 designated the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019,2021
 and 2024 as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for them as fair value hedges. These transactions were designated as fair valuehedges
 for financial accounting purposes because they protected us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due tobenchmark
 interest  rate  movements.  In  2019, $1.15  billion related  to  our 2.200%  senior  notes  due  2019  of  the $2.4  billion aggregate  notionalamount
 matured. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million  of our 
2.875% senior  notes due July 2021 and $500  million of  our 3.450%  senior  notes due July 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedgeaccounting
 was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as an increase to the long-term debt balance and is beingrecognized
 over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. The gain recognized during the year ended December31, 2019 was immaterial
. Non-Designated Hedges
Our
 derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetaryassets
 or  liabilities,  including  intercompany  balances  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies.  The  gains  and  losses  on  our  derivatives  notdesignated
 as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other,  net, which are offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the relatedassets
 and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net. We classify cash flows related to our non-designated hedging instruments asoperating activities in our consolid
ated statement of cash flows.Warrant
We
 entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  conjunction  with  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5%  of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warranthas
 a term of seven  years  and will vest in a series of four  tranches,  at a specified price per share upon meeting significant processing volumemilestone
 targets on a calendar year basis. If and when the relevant milestone is reached, the warrant becomes exercisable with respect to thecorresponding tranche of warrant shares up
 until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranches that can vest inone calendar year is 
two . 
The
 warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives  and Hedging.  We report the warrant at fair value within otherassets
 in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in interest and other, net in our consolidatedstatement
 of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of the warrant, which was recorded as a deferred credit, is reported withinother liabilities in our consoli
dated balance sheets and will be amortized over the life of the commercial arrangement.F-24

Credit Risk
Our derivatives
 expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek tomitigate
 such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of losswith
 any one counterparty  resulting  from  this type of credit  risk  is monitored  on an ongoing basis.  To further  limit  credit  risk,  we also enter  intocollateral
 security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fairvalue
 of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgradeby either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral rel
ated to our foreign exchange derivative transactions.Note 8 – Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities

Our
 financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1), less active markets (Level 2) and little orno
 market activity (Level 3). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involvingidentical
 assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instrumentsin
 less  active  markets,  or  models  using  market  observable  inputs.  Level  3  instrument  valuations  typically  reflect  management’s  estimate  ofassumptions
 that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability.  We  did  not  have  any  transfers  of  financial  instruments  betweenvaluation levels during 
2019  or 2018. The
 majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputswhere
 applicable, such as equity prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates. Our warrant, which is accounted for as aderivative
 instrument,  is  valued  using  a  Black-Scholes  model.  Key  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  include  risk-free  interest  rates;  Adyen’scommon
 stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding; exercise price; and details specific to the warrant. The value is also probabilityadjusted
 for management assumptions with respect to meeting the processing volume milestone targets. These assumptions and the probability ofmeeting
 processing volume milestone targets may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. Refer to “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments”for further details on our derivative instruments.
Other
 financial  instruments,  including  accounts  receivable  and  accounts  payable,  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  their  fair  valuebecause of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Senior NotesIn
 2019, $400  million of  floating rate notes and $1.15  billion of 2.200% fixed  rate notes matured and were repaid. In 2018, $750  million of 2.500%
 fixed rate notes due 2018 matured and were repaid. None of
 the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000%  fixed rate notes due 205
6 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100%  of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpai
d interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from timeto time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and un
paid interest.If a
 change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.150%  fixed  rate notes due 2020, the 3.800%  fixed  rate notes due 2022, thefloating rate notes
 due 2023, the 2.750%  fixed  rate notes due 2023, the 3.600%  fixed rate  notes due 2027 or the 6.000%  fixed rate  notes due 2056,we
 must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101%  of  the principal amount,plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith respect to specified properties, and also inclu
des customary events of default.To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion  of  our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread.These
 swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes ininterest
 rates. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of thehedged
 portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in market interest rates. In 2019, $1.15  billion related  to our 2.200%  senior notes
 of the $2.4  billion aggregate  notional amount matured. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2019, we terminated theinterest rate
 swaps related to $750 million  of our 2.875%  senior notes  due July 2021 and $500 million  of our 3.450%  senior  notes due July 2024. Asa
 result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as an increase to thelong-term
 debt  balance  and  is  being  recognized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  underlying  debt  as  a  reduction  to  interest  expense.  The  gainrecognized during the year ended D
ecember 31, 2019 was immaterial. The
 effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization ofany
 original  issue  discount  on  these  senior  notes.  Interest  on  these  senior  notes  is  payable  either  quarterly  or  semiannually.  Interest  expenseassociated
 with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December  31, 2019, 2018 and 2017  was approximately 
$301 million , $318 million and $307 million ,  respectively. As of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the  estimated fair value of these seniornotes, using Level 2 inputs, was approximately 
$7.9 billion  and $9.0 billion , respectively. Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof up to 
$1.5 billion  outstandi ng at any time with maturities of up to 397  days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2019  and 2018, there  wereno
 commercial paper notes outstanding.Credit Agreement
In
 November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2  billion five-year revolving credit facility. We mayalso,
 subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amountof 
$1 billion.  Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and othergeneral corporate purposes.
As
 of December  31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion  credit  agreement. However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5 billion  commercial  paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion  of  available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in orderto repay commercial paper borrowings in the event
F-31

we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result, $500 million  of  borrowing capacity was availableas of 
December 31, 2019  for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans
 under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent
 to 1.5  percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5  percent or LIBOR plus 1.0 percent, plus a
 margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero  percent to 0.5  percent. The credit agreement will terminate and allamounts
 owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our requestor,
 if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity dateis
 extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,affirmative
 and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  Thenegative
 covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.The
 financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximumconsolidated
 leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect tous.
We were in compliance with all covena

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
December 31, 2019 ,  we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2019 , we  had a total of $4.8 billion  in  aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.7 billion in cash withdrawals, held within the fin
ancial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Litigation and Other Legal Matters
 
Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate of the reasonably possible loss or
 range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of lossesarising
 directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 12, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve  months ended December
 31, 2019.  Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 12, we have concluded, based on currently availableinformation,
 that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  orsettlement)
 in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable andsubject
 to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations,
 the  impact  on  our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  material.  Legal  fees  are  expensed  asincurred.
General Matte
rsThird
 parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Weare subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be sub
ject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our businessas
 our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/oragainst
 our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposureto
 such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past beenforced
 to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, theLanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are

interpreted
 by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and ourgeographical
 operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  in  jurisdictions  where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  onlineintermedi
aries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyrightor
 trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend andresolve,
 could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreementson unfavorable terms.
From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules,
 policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,prices,
 rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  andregulatory
 landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products andservices
 that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatoryactions
 against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages forcertain
 causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significa
nt amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significantoperational resources or otherwise harm our business.
Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the un
ique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.To
 date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant,either individually or
 collectively. F-36

Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
We
 are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the numberof
 shares included within each series; to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any relatedqualifications,
 limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of aseries
 then outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2019  and 2018 ,  there were 10 million  shares of $0.001
 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and no  shares issued or outstanding.Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issu
e 3.6 billion  shares of common stock. Stock Repurchase Programs
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject to market
 conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstandingshare
 count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privatelynegotiat
ed transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deemsappropri
ate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminatedat
 any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate andregulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.  In
 January  2018,  our  Board  of  Directors  (“Board”)  authorized  a $6.0  billion stock  repurchase  program,  and  in  January  2019,  our  Boardauthorized
 an additional 4.0 billion  stock  repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during 
2019  was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Incentive Plans
 
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  As  ofDecember 31, 2019
, 755 million shares were authorized under our equity incentiv e plans and 55 million  shares were available for future grant. Stock
 options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5%  six months from the date of grant (or 25%  one year from the date of grant forgrants to
 new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08%  per  month thereafter, and generally expire seven  to ten years from the dateof
 grant. RSU awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over a periodof 
three to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date.In 
2019, 2018 and 2017 ,  certain executives were eligible to receive PBRSUs. PBRSU awards are subject to performance and time-basedvesting
 requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measuredagainst the
 performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Generally, if the performancecriteria are satisfied, one-
half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the other half of the award vests in Marchof the following year.
Deferred Stock Units
Prior
 to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  ourannual
 meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to anew
 non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25%  one year from the date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08%  per  month thereafter. Inaddition,
 directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwisebe
 payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date ofgrant.
 Following termination of a non-employee director’s service on the Board, deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013 are payable instock
 or cash (at our election), while deferred stock units granted on or after August 1, 2013 are payable solely in stock. As of December 31, 2019 , there
 were  approximately 207,179  deferred  stock  units  outstanding,  which  are  included  in  our  restricted  stock  unit  activity  below.  As  ofDecember 31, 2016, we no longer grant deferred stock units.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We
 have  an  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (“ESPP”)  for  all  eligible  employees.  Under  the  plan,  shares  of  our  common  stock  may  bepurchased
 over  an  offering  period  with  a  maximum  duration  of two  years  at 85%  of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  first  day  of  theapplicable
 offering period or on the last day of the six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their eligible compensatio
n during an offering period. During 2019 , 2018, and 2017 , employees purchased approximately 3 million , 4 million and 4 million
 shares  under this plan at average prices of $25.24 , $23.82 and $22.32  per  share, respectively. As of December  31, 2019,  approximately 9 million
 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance. Stock Option Activity
No stock options were granted in 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 . During 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our equity incentive plans was $20 million , $18 millionand 
$26  million,  respectively,  determined  as  of  the  date  of  option  exercise.  As  of December  31,  2019,  options  to  purchase  approximately 800 thousand
 shares of our common stock were outstanding and in-the-money. F-38

 all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase tothe
 extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of grants between stock options and restricted stock units or assume unvested equityawards in connection wi

We
 have a defined contribution  plan, which is qualified under  Section 401(k)  of  the Internal  Revenue Code.  Participating  employees  maycontribute
 up to 50%  of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  we contributed one dollar for eachdollar
 a  participant  contributed,  with  a  maximum  contribution  of 4%  of  each  employee’s  eligible  compensation,  subject  to  a  maximum  employercontribution
 of $11,200 , $11,000 and $10,800  per  employee for each period, respectively. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by various othersavings plans. Total expense for these plans w

$ 1,731  $1,868 As
 of December  31, 2019,  our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $11 million
, $55 million and $361  million,  respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations underSection
 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards willbegin
 to expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $12 million do
 not expire, $246 million  are  subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2020, and $104 million  are  not subject to valuation allowancebut
 will begin to expire in 2024. As of December  31, 2019,  state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $140 million . Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.
As
 of December  31, 2019 and 2018 ,  we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarilyto operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictio
ns and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized.During the first half of 2017, we recognized a noncash i
ncome tax charge of $376 million  caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset related to
 intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of theintangible
 assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result of voluntary domiciling our Classifieds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction andrecognized a tax benefit of 
$695 million . On
 December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal income taxrate from 
35%  to 21% beginning in 2018, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriationof
 unremitted  foreign  earnings  in  2017  and  created  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  recognized  a  provisionalincome tax
 charge of $3.1 billion  in  the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidatedstatement
 of income.  We  completed  our  analysis  of the  impacts  of U.S.  tax reform  in the fourth  quarter  of 2018 and recognized  a $463  millionreduction
 to the provisional tax amounts  recorded in the fourth  quarter of 2017, which is included as a component of income tax expense fromcontinuing operations in
 2018.Included
 in the 2017 provisional amount was $1.4  billion for  the income tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. Wecompleted
 the computation of this amount as part of the 2017 income tax return filing and reduced the provisional amount by $18  million and  weutilized 
$213 million  of foreign tax credits to reduce the net F-41

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
liability,
 both  in  2018.  We  elected  to  pay  the  liability  for  the  deemed  repatriation  of  foreign  earnings  in  installments,  as  specified  by  theAct.
 Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $884 million  and $968 million  of  our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings wasincluded in other liabilitie
s on our consolidated balance sheet.The
 remaining  provisional  amount  of $1.7  billion was  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.minimum tax
 on foreign earnings, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreignearnings. We completed our analysis of the components of the deferred tax computatio
n in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a tax benefit of$445
 million as  a reduction to the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the deferred income tax effects of the Act. Thisamount
 includes  a $389  million tax  benefit  as  a  result  of  clarification  by  Swiss  tax  authorities  regarding  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  torepatriated earnings in October 2018.
We
 have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvestthe
 unremitted  earnings  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  We  have  not  provided  for  deferred  taxes  on  outside  basisdifferences
 in  our  investments  in  our  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  unrelated  to  unremitted  earnings.  These  basis  differences  will  be  indefinitelyreinvested. A determination of the unrecognized d
eferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis difference is not practicable.The following table reflects changes i
n unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017  (in millions):

 within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $387 million  as  of December 31, 2019  is $55 million of  unrecognized taxbenefits
 indemnified by PayPal. If total unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $285 million . Of this amount, approximately 
$51 million  of  unrecognized tax benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reduced upona
 future  realization.  As  of December  31, 2019,  our  liabilities  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were  included  in  other  liabilities  on  our  consolidatedbalance sheet.
We
 recognize  interest  and/or  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  income  tax  expense.  In 2019 , $8  million was  included  in  taxexpense for
 interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2019  and 2018  was approximately $46 million and 
$61 million, respectively.  
We
 are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  bycertain
 tax  authorities  for  the  2008  to  2018  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  mayultimately
 result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for taxyears after 2007 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and Californ
ia), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
Although
 the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  grossunrecognized
 tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and thenumber
 of  matters  being  examined,  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  full  range  of  possible  adjustments  to  the  balance  of  gross  unrecognized  taxbenefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced w
ithin the next twelve months by at least $19 million .  
On
 July 27, 2015, in Altera  Corp. v. Commissioner,  the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatmentof

 following  Altera’s petition filed on July 22, 2019. It has not been determined if this ruling will be further appealed as of the date ofour

 the risk of the Tax Court’s decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any benefit or expense as of December 31, 2019 . We will continue to monitor ongoing d

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): (i) its common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“common stock”), and (ii) its
6.00% Notes due 2056.
References in the following discussion to “eBay,” “eBay Inc.,” “we,” “our” and “us” and similar references mean eBay Inc.
excluding, unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise expressly stated, its subsidiaries.
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
The
 following is a description of some of the terms of our common stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the“charter”),
 our amended and restated bylaws (the “bylaws”) and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).The following description
 is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our charter and bylaws, each of whichis
 filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, and the DGCL. Youshould read our charter and bylaws and the applicable provisions of the DGCL for a complete statement of the provisions described under this
caption “Description of Common Stock” and for other provisions that may be important to you.
Common Stock
Under
 our charter, the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which we are authorized to issue is 3,590,000,000 shares,consisting
 of two classes: 3,580,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share(“preferred stock”).
Each
 share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders. Ourcharter
 does not entitle the holders of our common stock to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of our directors. This meansthat
 the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election by ourcommon
 stockholders (assuming there are no outstanding shares of our preferred stock entitled to vote as a single class with our commonstock in such election).
Nominees for election
 as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders shall stand for election to a one-year term expiring at the nextannual
 meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to earlier death, resignation,retirement
 or removal. Pursuant to our bylaws and subject to the rights of any series of our preferred stock that may be outstanding, eachmember
 of our board of directors shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director(excluding
 abstentions) by the shares represented and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present; provided,however,
 that if our board of directors determines that the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected atsuch
 meeting (a “Contested Election”) and has not rescinded that determination as provided in our bylaws, each of the directors to be electedat
 such meeting shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented and entitled to vote at suchmeeting
 with respect to the election of such director. If an incumbent director fails to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votescast at a meeting for the election of directors
 

(other than a Contested Election), either our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or a committee of independent directors shalldetermine
 whether to accept or reject any resignation that may have been previously tendered by such incumbent director or whether otheraction
 should be taken (including whether to request the incumbent director to resign from the board of directors if no resignation haspreviously been tendered).
Unless
 otherwise provided by applicable law, the rules or regulations of any applicable stock exchange, or our charter or bylaws,every matter
 to be voted on by our stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders ofa
 majority in voting power of the shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon that are present in person or represented by proxy at theapplicable meeting.
Our
 bylaws require us to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name of any person nominated forelection
 to our board of directors by a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of upto
 20 beneficial owners who own and have owned, in each case continuously for at least three years, at least 3% (determined as provided inour
 bylaws) of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding common stock and any other capital stock entitled to vote generally in theelection
 of directors; provided that such stockholders give us written notice of such request within the time period set forth in our bylaws andsuch
 stockholders and their nominees satisfy the other requirements specified in our bylaws; and provided, further, that the number of suchnominees
 whose names appear in our proxy materials shall not exceed the greater of (x) two nominees and (y) the largest whole number ofnominees that does not exceed 20% of the number of our directors then in office, subject to possible reduction as provided in our bylaws.
Subject
 to any preferential rights of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock to receive dividends before any dividends may bepaid
 on our common stock, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in any dividends payable on our common stockthat may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.
Upon
 our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to shareratably
 in any of our assets remaining for distribution to our common stockholders after payment of or provision for our debts and otherliabilities
 and subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock to receive distributions in the event of ourliquidation, dissolution or winding-up before distributions are made to holders of our common stock.
Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights.
Under our charter, our board of directors is authorized, without vote or other action by our stockholders, to cause the issuance of up to
10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock in one or more series from time to time, to establish the number of shares to be included in each such
series
 and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series (which may include, without limitation,voting
 rights, dividend rights and preferences, liquidation rights and preferences, redemption provisions and rights to convert the preferredstock
 of such series into other securities or property) and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, and to increase or decrease thenumber
 of shares of any such series (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding). Our board of directors mayauthorize the issuance of
 preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation, conversion or other rights (which may include, without limitation,rights
 of one or more series of preferred stock, voting as a separate class, to elect one or more directors, rights of one or more series ofpreferred

dissolution or winding-up before any dividends or distributions may be paid to holders of our common stock) that could dilute or otherwiseadversely
 affect the voting power or the dividend, liquidation or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferredstock,
 while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could, among otherthings,
 have  the  effect  of  delaying,  deterring  or  preventing  a  merger,  change  of  control  or  other  takeover  of  our  company  that  ourstockholders
 might consider to be in their best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the marketprice
 of our common stock, and may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any other securities that we may issueand the voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law
We
 are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (“Section 203”). In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporationfrom engaging in “business combination”
 transactions with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time that thestockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:
•
prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the corporation’s board of directors approved either the applicablebusiness combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;
•
upon  consummation  of  the  transaction  which  resulted  in  the  stockholder  becoming  an  interested  stockholder,  the  interestedstockholder
 owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excludingfor
 purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) shares ownedby
 directors who are also officers of the corporation and shares owned by employee stock plans in which the employee participantsdo
 not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchangeoffer; or
•
at or subsequent to the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by thecorporation’s
 board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.
A
 “business combination” is defined to include, among other things and in general and subject to exceptions, a merger of thecorporation
 with the interested stockholder; a sale of 10% or more of the market value of the corporation’s consolidated assets to theinterested stockholder; certain transactions that result in the issuance of the corporation’s stock to the interested stockholder; a transaction that
has
 the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the corporation’s stock owned by the interested stockholder; and any receipt by theinterested
 stockholder of loans, guarantees or other financial benefits provided by the corporation. An “interested stockholder” is defined toinclude,
 in general and subject to exceptions, a person that (1) owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation or (2) isan “affiliate” or “associate” (as
 defined in Section 203) of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the corporation’s outstandingvoting stock at any time within the prior three year period.
A
 Delaware corporation may opt out of Section 203 with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by anamendment
 to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to be governed by Section 203 and approved by a majority ofits
 outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out of Section 203. As a result, Section 203 could delay, deter or prevent a merger, changeof control or other takeover of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests, including
3

transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our common stock, and may also adversely affect the marketprice of our common stock and any other securities that we may issue.
Anti-Takeover Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws
Certain
 provisions of our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiringor seeking to acquire control of us. For example, our charter and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that:
•
authorize our board of directors, without vote or other action by our stockholders, to cause the issuance of preferred stock in one ormore
 series from time to time and, with respect to each series, to establish the number of shares constituting that series and to fix therights
 and other terms of that series, which may include, without limitation, voting rights, dividend rights and preferences, liquidationrights and preferences and rights to convert the preferred stock of such series into other securities or property;
•
provide that, subject to the rights of any series of our preferred stock that may be outstanding, vacancies on our board of directors ornewly
 created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directorsthen in office, even though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director;
•
provide that the number of directors constituting our board of directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by ourboard of directors;
•
require that actions to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not bywritten consent;
•
establish advance notice procedures and other requirements for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to ourboard of directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;
•
provide that, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock that may be outstanding and except as may be required by law,special
 meetings of stockholders may be called only by (1) our board of directors; (2) our Chairman of the Board; (3) our ChiefExecutive
 Officer; or (4) our Secretary upon the written request of one or more of our stockholders that have continuously held, fortheir
 own account or on behalf of others, at least a 20% aggregate “net long position” (as defined and determined as provided in ourbylaws)
 of our outstanding common stock for at least 30 days as of the date such request is delivered to us and that have compliedwith the other requirements set forth in our bylaws; and
•
do not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, which means that theholders
 of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock can elect all directors standing for election by our commonstockholders.
The
 provisions described above are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bidsand
 to encourage anyone seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. However, these provisions may alsodelay,
 deter or prevent a merger, change of control or other takeover of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their bestinterests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our common stock,
4

and may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any other securities that we may issue. These provisions may alsohave the effect of preventing changes in our management.
Limitation on Liability of Directors; Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Our charter provides
 that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of our directors shall be personally liable for monetary damagesfor
 breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permittedby
 the DGCL. We believe that these limitations of liability and indemnification provisions are useful to attract and retain qualified directorsand officers.

GeneralThe
 notes were originally issued on February 29, 2016. The notes constitute a separate series of debt securities under the indenture,were issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 and will mature on February 1, 2056.
We
 may from time to time, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes, issueadditional
 notes having the same terms (except for the issue date, public offering price, sale price, the first interest payment date and the datefrom
 which interest shall begin to accrue) as, and ranking equally in right of payment with, the notes then outstanding. Any such additionalnotes, together with the notes then outstanding, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture.
The notes are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “EBAYL.”
The notes
 are issuable in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 in principal amount and in integral multiplesof
 $25 in principal amount in excess thereof. The notes are in book-entry form and are evidenced by one or more notes in global form(“global
 notes”), registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as depositary (the “Depositary”) for the global notes, orits
 nominee. Beneficial owners of interests in the global notes are not entitled to receive physical certificates registered in their names exceptin
 the limited circumstances described below under “Description of Indenture — Book-Entry Form and Transfer” and, unless physicalcertificates registered in their names are issued, beneficial owners will not be considered “holders” of notes under the indenture.
The
 notes are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. Except as described below under “—Change of Control TriggeringEvent,”
 the indenture does not contain any provisions which are intended to protect holders of notes in the event of a change of control ofeBay
 or a highly leveraged transaction (whether or not relating to a change of control) involving eBay. The indenture does not limit theincurrence of unsecured debt by us or any of our subsidiaries.
We
 may at our option, at any time or from time to time, repurchase notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, and may holdor resell such notes or surrender such notes to the trustee for cancellation.
Ranking
The
 notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future seniorunsecured
 indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness tothe
 extent of the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, the notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existingand
 future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, which are separate legal entities from us and have no obligation to pay anyamounts due pursuant to the notes or to make funds available for such purpose.
Interest
The
 notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per year, accruing from the most recent date to which we have paid or provided for intereston
 the notes. Interest on the notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year (each, an“interest
 payment date”). Interest paid on the notes on any interest payment date is payable to the persons who were the registered holders ofthe
 notes at the close of business on the January 15, April 15, July 15 or October 15, as the case may be, whether or not a business day,immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date.

Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payableon
 the notes on any interest payment date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below), maturity date or other dateon

 of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. If an interest payment date, redemption date, Change ofControl

As
 used under this caption “—Change of Control Triggering Event,” all references to rules and regulations under the Exchange Actshall
 include any successor provisions thereto; and all references to “the Change of Control Triggering Event covenant,” “the Change ofControl
 Triggering Event provisions” and other similar references mean all of the terms and provisions set forth above under this caption “—Change of Control Triggering Event.”
If
 we are required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficientfinancial
 resources available, or that we will be able to arrange sufficient financing, to satisfy our obligation to repurchase the notes.Moreover,
 any such failure to repurchase the notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event could constitute anevent
 of default under other debt instruments of ours and our subsidiaries resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that otherindebtedness. Any
 of these events could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and on the market value of thenotes.
The
 Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the notes may not provide holders of notes protection in the event of highlyleveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or similar
11

transactions involving us that might adversely affect holders of notes. In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change ofControl
 Triggering Event with respect to the notes, in which case we would not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respectto
 the notes. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, neither the notes nor the indenture containprovisions
 that permit holders of notes to require us to repurchase or repay the notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger orsimilar transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries.
In
 addition, clause (b) of the definition of “Change of Control” appearing above includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirectsale, transfer, conveyance
 or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation) of “all or substantially all” of the properties andassets
 of us and our Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”there
 is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, our obligation to make an offer to repurchase thenotes
 as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the properties and assets of us and our Subsidiaries,taken as a whole, may be uncertain.
Moreover,
 under clause (c) of the definition of Change of Control appearing above, a Change of Control will occur when a majorityof
 the members of our board of directors are not “Continuing Directors” (as defined above). In a decision in connection with a proxy contest,a
 Delaware court held that the existing directors could approve a dissident slate of director nominees (who would constitute a majority of thenew
 board of directors) as “continuing directors” under a similar indenture provision and avoid triggering a change of control under suchindenture,
 provided the incumbent directors give their approval in the good faith exercise of their fiduciary duties. Therefore, in certaincircumstances involving a
 significant change in the composition of our board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest whereour
 board of directors does not endorse a dissident slate of directors but approves them as “Continuing Directors” for purposes of the Changeof Control
 Triggering Event provisions, holders of the notes may not be entitled to require us to make a Change of Control Offer with respectto the notes.

The
 indenture provides that any amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind every holder of debt securities of each series affectedby
 such amendment, supplement or waiver unless it is of the type, or relates to any of the matters, described in any of the bullet points in theimmediately
 preceding paragraph. In that case then, anything in the indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the amendment, supplement orwaiver
 shall bind every holder of a debt security who has consented to it and every subsequent holder of a debt security or portion of a debtsecurity that evidences the same debt as the consenting holder’s debt security. (Section 9.5 of the base indenture)
The
 holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all debtsecurities of such
 series, waive any past default or event of default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences, excepta
 default or event of default in the payment of the principal of, or premium or interest, if any, on, any debt security of that series; provided,however,
 that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration of thedebt
 securities of that series and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration. (Section 6.13 ofthe base indenture)
Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants
The
 indenture provides that, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the indenture, we shall be deemed to have paid anddischarged
 the entire indebtedness on all outstanding debt securities of any series on the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred to inclause
 (a) under “—Conditions to Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” below with respect to the debt securities of such series andthe provisions of the indenture, as it relates to the outstanding debt securities of such series, shall no longer be in effect except for:
23

•the rights of holders of debt securities of such series to receive, solely from the funds described in clause (a) under “—Conditions
 to Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” below, payment of the principal of and premium and interest, ifany, on the outstanding debt securities of such series when due; and
•
a limited number of other provisions of the indenture, including provisions relating to transfers and exchanges of, and themaintenance
 of a registrar and paying agent for, the debt securities of such series and the replacement of stolen, lost ormutilated debt securities of such series.
We
 sometimes refer to this as “legal defeasance.” Upon the legal defeasance of the debt securities of any series, we will bedischarged
 from our obligations to make payments on the debt securities of such series and (subject to the exceptions as described above) allof our other obligations under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of such series.
The
 indenture further provides that, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the indenture, we will be released from ourobligations
 under, and may omit to comply with, the covenants described under the heading “—Covenants” above and certain othercovenants in the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series, as well as any additional covenants applicable to the debt securities
of
 such series which may be identified in a resolution of our board of directors (or committee thereof), supplemental indenture or officers’certificate establishing the
 terms of the debt securities of such series as provided in the indenture as being subject to covenant defeasance, andthe
 failure to comply with any such covenants shall not constitute a default or event of default with respect to any debt securities of suchseries. We sometimes refer to this as “covenant defeasance.”
Conditions
 to Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.  In order to effect legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the debtsecurities of any series, we must, among other things:
(a)
deposit with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities of any series denominatedin
 a currency other than U.S. dollars, money and/or foreign government obligations, that, through the payment of interest andprincipal
 in accordance with their terms, will provide an amount in cash sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognizedfirm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest, if any, on
and
 any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the dates those payments are dueor, if applicable, any redemption date;
(b)
in the case of legal defeasance, deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that we have received from, or therehas been published by, the
 United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of the indenture, there has been achange in the
 applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinionshall
 confirm that, the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United Statesfederal
 income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, legal defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United Statesfederal
 income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if suchdeposit, legal defeasance and discharge had not occurred; and
(c)
in the case of covenant defeasance, deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debtsecurities
 of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result ofsuch deposit and covenant
24

defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at thesame
 times as would have been the case if such deposit and covenant defeasance had not occurred. (Sections 8.3 and 8.4 ofthe base indenture)
In
 the event we exercise our option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of debt securities and the debt securitiesof that
 series are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an event of default (including an event of default due to our failure tocomply
 with any covenant that remains in effect following such covenant defeasance), the amount of money and/or U.S. governmentobligations
 or foreign government obligations, as the case may be, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on thedebt securities of that series on
 the dates those payments are due or, if applicable, a redemption date, but may not be sufficient to pay amountsdue
 on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from the event of default. However, we shall remain liable forthose payments.
When we use the term “U.S. government obligations,” we mean:
•
securities which are (a) direct obligations of the United States of America for the payment of which its full faith and credit ispledged
 or (b) obligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the UnitedStates
 of America, the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the UnitedStates of America, and which in the case of (a) and (b) are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof; and
•
depository receipts issued by a bank or trust company as custodian with respect to any such U.S. government obligations or aspecific
 payment of interest on, or principal of or other amount payable with respect to, such U.S. government obligationsheld
 by such custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt, provided that (except as required by law) suchcustodian is
 not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from anyamount
 received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. government obligation or the specific payment of interest on orprincipal of or other amount payable with respect to the U.S. government obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.
Satisfaction and Discharge
The indenture will cease to be of any further effect with respect to any series of debt securities if:
•
all outstanding debt securities of such series have (subject to certain exceptions) been delivered to the trustee for cancellation;or
•
all outstanding debt securities of such series not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due andpayable,
 will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, have been called for redemption or are to becalled
 for redemption within one year, or have been legally defeased as described above under “—Defeasance of DebtSecurities
 and Certain Covenants,” and (except in the case of debt securities that have been legally defeased) we havedeposited
 with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, and premium and interest, if any, on, such debtsecurities to
 the date of such deposit (in the case of debt securities which have become due and payable on or prior to the dateof such deposit) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;
25

and, in either case, we also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable under the indenture by us with respect to the debt securities of thatseries and satisfy certain other conditions specified in the indenture. We sometime refer to this as “satisfaction and discharge.” (Section 8.1 of
the base indenture)
Notwithstanding
 the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series, a limited number ofprovisions
 of the indenture shall remain in effect, including provisions relating to transfers and exchanges of, and the maintenance of aregistrar and paying agent for, debt securities, and the replacement of stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities.
Repayment of Unclaimed Funds
The
 indenture provides that the trustee and any paying agent shall pay to us upon request any money, U.S. government obligations orforeign
 government obligations held by them for payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, or any sinking fund payment on any debtsecurities
 that remain unclaimed for two years after the respective dates such principal, interest or premium, if any, or sinking fund paymentshall
 have become due and payable. Thereafter, holders of debt securities entitled to those payments must look to us for payment as generalcreditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. (Section 8.5 of the base indenture)
Governing Law
The indenture and the debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
No Recourse Against Others
The
 indenture provides that a director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of ours shall not have any liability for any of ourobligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.
The
 indenture further provides that each holder of debt securities, by accepting a debt security, waives and releases all such liability and thatsuch waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the debt securities.
Book-Entry Form and Transfer
The
 debt securities of any series may be issued in the form of one or more debt securities in global, fully registered form (“globalsecurities”), without interest coupons. Each
 such global security will be deposited with or on behalf of a depositary for the global securities ofsuch series (the “Depositary”) and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary. The following discussion assumes
that The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will be the Depositary.
Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through the Depositary if they are direct participants (as defined below)
or indirectly through organizations that are participants (as defined below) in the Depositary. Except in the limited circumstances described
below, holders of beneficial interests in the global securities of any series will not be entitled to receive debt securities of such series in
definitive, certificated form (“certificated securities”) or to have debt securities of such series registered in their names.
The Depositary holds securities of institutions that have accounts with the Depositary (“direct participants”) to facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants,
thereby eliminating the need for
26

physical movement of securities certificates. The Depositary’s direct participants include brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies, clearingcorporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to the Depositary’s book-entry system is also available to other organizations
(“indirect participants” and, together with direct participants, “participants”), such as brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing
corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, whether directly or indirectly. The rules
applicable to the Depositary and its direct participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
So long
 as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of a global security of any series, the Depositary or such nominee, asthe case
 may be, will be considered the sole holder and owner of the debt securities represented by such global security for all purposes underthe
 indenture and such debt securities. Owners of beneficial interests in a global security of any series will not be considered the owners orholders
 of the debt securities of such series under the indenture, will not be able to transfer those beneficial interests except in accordancewith
 the procedures of the Depositary and its participants and, except under the limited circumstances set forth below, will not be entitled toreceive
 certificated securities or to have debt securities registered in their names. Accordingly, each owner of a beneficial interest in a globalsecurity
 of any series must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a direct participant, on the procedures of theparticipants through which it owns its beneficial interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities of such series under the indenture.
We
 understand that, under existing industry practice, in the event owners of beneficial interests in global securities of any series wish to takeany
 action that DTC or its nominee, as the holder of such global securities, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the applicableparticipants
 to take such action, and that such participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take suchaction or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such beneficial owners. Because DTC can only act on behalf of direct participants, who
in
 turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that donot participate
 in the DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificaterepresenting that interest.
All
 payments on the debt securities of any series represented by a global security registered in the name of the Depositary or itsnominee
 will be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered holder of the global security. We expect that theDepositary or
 its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, or premium or interest, if any, on, a global security of any series, willcredit
 the applicable direct participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in theprincipal
 amount of the global security as shown on the records of the Depositary. We also expect that payments by participants to owners ofbeneficial
 interests in the global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices asis
