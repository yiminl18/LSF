alliances, divestitures, joint ventures, or other investments; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce
fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness; our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives; the impacts of our
international operations; economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do business; changes in our
management team or other key personnel and our ability to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce; risks associated with

commodity, energy, and other input costs; volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use; increased pension, labor and people-
related expenses; compliance with laws, regulations, and related interpretations and related legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions, including
additional risks and uncertainties related to our restatement and any potential actions resulting from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ongoing
investigation, as well as potential additional subpoenas, litigation, and regulatory proceedings; an inability to remediate the material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting or additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or the failure to maintain an effective system of
internal controls; our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports; the restatement of certain of our previously issued consolidated financial
statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues; our ability to protect intellectual property
rights; tax law changes or interpretations; the impact of future sales of our common stock in the public markets; our ability to continue to pay a regular
dividend and the amounts of any such dividends; volatility of capital markets and other macroeconomic factors. For additional information on these and other
factors that could affect our forward-looking statements, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. We disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statement in this report, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

Explanatory Note
General
On May 2, 2019, management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, concluded that our audited consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and
each of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods in fiscal year 2017 and each of our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 included in our
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018,
March 31, 2018, and September 30, 2017) and Form 10-Q/A (unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended July 1,
2017 and April 1, 2017) should no longer be relied upon due to misstatements that are described in greater detail below, and that we would restate such
financial statements to make the necessary accounting corrections. We discussed this conclusion with our independent registered public accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Restatement
This Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes audited consolidated financial statements at December 29, 2018 and
December 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, as well as relevant unaudited interim financial
information for the quarterly periods ended December 29, 2018, September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, September 30,
2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017. We have restated certain information within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial
statements at December 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, selected financial data at and for the year ended
January 3, 2016, and the relevant unaudited interim financial information for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018,
December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 (collectively known as the “Financial Statements”).
Restatement Background
As described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 6, 2019, management noted certain
misstatements contained in the Financial Statements relating principally to the accounting treatment for supplier contracts and related arrangements. As
previously disclosed, we received a subpoena from the SEC in October 2018related to our procurement area, specifically the accounting policies, procedures,
and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to
agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with external counsel and forensic accountants, and subsequently, under
the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”), conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and
related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation, which is now complete and which identified that multiple employees in the
procurement area engaged in misconduct, we corrected prior period misstatements that generally increased the total cost of products sold in prior financial
periods. These misstatements principally related to the incorrect timing of when certain cost and rebate elements associated with supplier contracts and related
arrangements were initially recognized. The findings from the internal investigation did not identify any misconduct by any member of the senior
management team. We continue to cooperate with the SEC concerning its investigation of these matters.
In connection with the internal investigation, we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other
potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates, incentive payments, and pricing arrangements. The review identified further
misstatements, which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. These misstatements were
primarily related to certain supplier contracts and related arrangements where the allocation of value of all or a portion of rebates and up-front payments to
contractual elements in the current period should have been deferred and recognized over an applicable contractual period. We corrected these misstatements
to defer the up-front consideration from suppliers when the retention or receipt of that consideration was contingent upon future events and to correctly
recognize the consideration as a reduction of cost of products sold over the terms of the arrangements with the suppliers.
4
Our internal investigation and review identified adjustments that resulted in an understatement of cost of products sold totaling $208 million, including $175
million relating to the periods up through September 29, 2018 that are being restated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The misstatements of cost of
products sold related to our internal investigation and review included $22 million for fiscal year 2018, $94 million for fiscal year 2017, $35 million for fiscal
year 2016, and $24 million for fiscal year 2015. We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior
financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number of years over which
the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions, suppliers, and procurement employees involved, we determined that it would be appropriate to
correct the misstatements in our previously issued consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also included
corrections for additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods. Accordingly, we have restated our consolidated
financial statements and the impacted amounts within the accompanying footnotes thereto.
In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of accounting standards
update (“ASU”) 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter
of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The
restated statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2017-07 and are labeled “As Recast.”
Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K restates amounts included in the 2017 Annual Report described above, including the audited consolidated financial
statements at December 30, 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In addition to the misstatements related to the
supplier contracts and related arrangements, including the misstatements related to lease classification, we corrected additional identified out-of-period and
uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements were related
to customer incentive program expense misclassifications, balance sheet misclassifications, income taxes, impairments, and other misstatements.
See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional
information.
The relevant unaudited interim financial information for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 30,
2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017, has also been restated. The 2018 quarterly restatements will be effective with the filing of our
future 2019 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement filings in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
See Note 23, Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited), in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for such restated information, and see
Supplemental Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information, in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, for additional interim financial information.
Selected financial information for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 has also been restated. See Item 6, Selected Financial Data.
This restatement resulted in the following decreases to our results:

Condition and Results of Operations, for the related definitions and reconciliations.

Control Considerations
In connection with the restatement, management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment,
management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting resulting in the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 29, 2018. Management has taken and is taking
additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, for additional
information related to these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and the related remedial measures.
Additional Information Specific to Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment
We announced on February 21, 2019 that as part of our normal quarterly reporting procedures and planning processes for the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair
values of certain goodwill and intangible assets were below their carrying amounts. As a result, we announced non-cash impairment losses of $15.4 billion to
lower the carrying amount of goodwill in certain reporting units, primarily U.S. Refrigerated and Canada Retail, and certain intangible assets, primarily the
Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6, 2019, we subsequently identified errors in the
calculations performed in connection with the interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Specifically, we identified certain errors in projected net cash flows and allocations to certain brands. Correcting this allocation error resulted in an increase to
the impairment losses initially calculated for brands of approximately $278 million, partially offset by a reduction to the impairment losses initially calculated
for reporting units of approximately $171 million.
In addition, the corrections to the carrying values on our balance sheet at December 29, 2018 recorded as part of the correction of the procurement-related
misstatements described above resulted in an adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain reporting units, and therefore resulted in a reduction to goodwill
impairment losses of approximately $92 million. The net impact of these misstatements was an increase of approximately $15 million from the $15.4 billion
total impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 previously announced in our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019.
As discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the
level of precision used to review the allocation of cash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim
impairment assessments in response to the significant reduction in, and in certain instances elimination of, the excess fair value over carrying amount for
certain brands that resulted from the changing business environment. This material weakness resulted in the errors in the calculations performed in connection
with the interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018, as described above, because approximately
five to ten percent of cash flows were not subjected to our control procedures. This material weakness arose during our interim impairment testing in the
fourth quarter of 2018 due to the significant reduction in excess fair value over carrying amount for certain brands as noted above, which required us to
increase the percentage of cash flows subject to our control procedures to nearly one hundred percent. This did not result in a misstatement of any previously
reported consolidated financial statements but was determined to be a material weakness because it could have resulted in a material misstatement that would
not have been prevented or detected.
PART I
Item 1. Business.
General
For 150 years, we have produced some of the world’s most beloved products at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC). Our Vision is To Be the Best Food
Company, Growing a Better World. We are one of the largest global food and beverage companies, with 2018 net sales of approximately $26 billion. Our
portfolio is a diverse mix of iconic and emerging brands. As the guardians of these brands and the creators of innovative new products, we are dedicated to
the sustainable health of our people and our planet.
On July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary
of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company, and H.
J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company.
Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire Hathaway”) and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P.
(“3G Capital”) (together, the “Sponsors”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.
6
Reportable Segments
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two
operating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
Our segments reflect a change, effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018, to reorganize our international businesses to better align our global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment into
the historical Europe reportable segment, forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became
the APAC operating segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
See Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our geographic financial information by segment.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long
as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by
segment based on net sales in 2018 were:
  Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks
United States  Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O
Canada  Kraft, Cracker Barrel, Heinz, Philadelphia, Maxwell House, Classico, McCafe*, P’Tit Quebec, Tassimo*
EMEA  Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Kraft, Benedicta, Karvan Cevitam
Rest of World  Heinz, ABC, Master, Quero, Kraft, Golden Circle, Wattie's, Glucon-D, Complan
*Used under license. Additionally, our license to use the McCafe brand in Canada will expire in December 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations, predominantly in Canada and India, including the intellectual
property rights to Cracker Barrel and P’Tit Quebec in Canada, as well as Glucon-D and Complan globally. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on these transactions.
We sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2018, brands used under licenses from third parties included Capri Sun packaged drink
pouches for sale in the United States, TGI Fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the United States and Canada, McCafe ground, whole bean, and on-demand
single cup coffees in the United States and Canada, and Taco Bell Home Originals Mexican-style food products in U.S. grocery stores. In addition, in our
agreements with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz International”) following the spin-off of Kraft from Mondelēz International in 2012, we each
granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time.
We also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties,
proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied
for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio
is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

Research and Development
Our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:
•product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth;
•world-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;
•superior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and
•continuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers,
large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional
companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product
quality and innovation, brand recognition and loyalty, service, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, the introduction of new products and
the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Improving our market
position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.
Sales and Customers
Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and
independent grocery accounts, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, bakeries, pharmacies, mass merchants, club stores, foodservice distributors, and
institutions, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, health care facilities, and certain government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various
e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2018, approximately 21% of our
net sales in 2017, and approximately 22% of our net sales in 2016.
Additionally, we have significant customers in different regions around the world; however, none of these customers are individually material to our
consolidated business. In 2018, the five largest customers in our U.S. segment accounted for approximately 49% of U.S. segment net sales, the five largest
customers in our Canada segment accounted for approximately 71% of Canada segment net sales, and the five largest customers in our EMEA segment
accounted for approximately 26% of our EMEA segment net sales.
Net Sales by Product Category
In 2018, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change for all historical
periods presented. The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were:
 December 29,
2018  December 30,
2017  December 31,
2016
Condiments and sauces 26% 25% 24%
Cheese and dairy 20% 21% 21%
Ambient foods 10% 10% 9%
Frozen and chilled foods 10% 10% 10%
Meats and seafood 10% 10% 10%

Raw Materials and Packaging
We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of
commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn
products, and wheat products, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, and cardboard to package
our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and
energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately
source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers
and smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with
many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and
agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe
weather or global climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy,
and agricultural programs.
Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices.
Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and
that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many
of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other
operational measures.
Seasonality and Working Capital
Although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the
year.
Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these factors
influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-period (e.g., a
shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results.
For information related to our cash flows provided by/(used for) operating activities, including working capital items, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.
Employees
We had approximately 38,000 employees as of December 29, 2018.
Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation,
storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality and safety of our products and their ingredients, and our occupational safety,
health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by federal, state, and local government
agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets where our products are manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug
Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection
Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of the United States,
including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are
also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act,
and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house
and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the
United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and other regulatory regime changes may add cost
and complexity to our compliance efforts.
9
Environmental Regulation
Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the
handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our
operations.
In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA
imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under
CERCLA (and other similar state actions under similar legislation) related to our current operations and certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for
which we retain liability.
As of December 29, 2018, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we
believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will
not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance
efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Industry Risks
We operate in a highly competitive industry.
The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as
well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service,
taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy
changing consumer preferences.
We may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures, including pressures in relation to private label products that are
generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to
commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact
the achievement of our objectives.
11
The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships
and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate
spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These
expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our
profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.
Our success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to
meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.
Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the
tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not
offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
We must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer
preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because
of our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product
offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories, demand for our
products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products (including as they relate to obesity or other health
concerns) could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer
preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences
could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are
inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on
our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to
correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon
the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our
competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance.
Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors in our major markets, may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but
larger customers for our business across various channels. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their positions to
improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically-tailored
product offerings. In addition, larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and
market their own private label products. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding
material and adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel
purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results.
In addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also
significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes, we may be
disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.
12
Changes in our relationships with significant customers, suppliers, or other business relationships could adversely impact us.
We derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business). There can be no assurance
that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as
increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a material
reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.
Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers
and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, terminations of relationships with other
significant contractual counterparties, including licensors, could adversely affect our portfolio, product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
In addition, the financial condition of such customers, suppliers, and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and
events that are beyond our control. Significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers, suppliers, and other business relationships
could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Maintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success.
We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our
existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.
We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product
innovation. Negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and
scrutiny of marketing practices. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social
impacts, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand
image, undermine our customers’ confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our
operations. Furthermore, existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response to
those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands.
In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment.
We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and
extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products, or our
suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition,
we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding
our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results
could be materially and adversely affected.
We must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products.
In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our
products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may
not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products
or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product
mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster-growing and more
profitable categories.
Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the
countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster-growing
and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market
share decreases in our key product categories, or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
13
Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.
Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or
other adulteration. We have decided and could in the future decide to, and have been or could in the future be required to, recall products due to suspected or
confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, undeclared allergens, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or
market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the
product for a period of time.
We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system
generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our
products, or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition.
We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our
marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory
enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product
liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.
We have a complex network of suppliers, owned and leased manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information
systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather,
raw material shortages, natural disasters, fires or explosions, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, could damage or disrupt
our operations or our suppliers’, co-manufacturers’ or distributors’ operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain
or distribution network. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key
manufacturing or distribution locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in
delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our
customers’ confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition, and operating results.
Business Risks
We may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures, joint ventures, or other investments.
From time to time, we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances, joint ventures, or other investments that may
strategically fit our business objectives, and we have divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or
profitability targets. These activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management’s
attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, inability to effectively and
immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population, adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier
business relationships, and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition
laws in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we may be required to obtain the approval of these transactions by
competition authorities, as well as to satisfy other legal requirements.
To the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories, we may
face additional risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations include compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations
outside of the United States, such as the FCPA, currency rate fluctuations, compliance with foreign regulations and laws, including tax laws, and exposure to
politically and economically volatile developing markets. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results.
14
We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and
improve our competitiveness.
We have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives, including our Integration Program (as defined in Overview, in Item 7, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We
have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our
competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives. In addition, certain of our
initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must accurately
predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry,
particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business, and
execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts, we could
be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, profitability, financial conditions, and operating results could be adversely
affected.
We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives.
We plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these
markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may
also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Any
of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. We may also face difficulties divesting business operations with
minimal impact to the retained businesses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives, that any new
business will be profitable or meet our expectations, or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption, which could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.
Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.
We are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 31% of our 2018 net sales
were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by
market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include:
•compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA;
•changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
tax laws or their interpretations, or tax audit implications;
•the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, or similar restrictions on our sales or imports, trade agreements, regulations, taxes,
or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs;
•currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values;
•compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national, and multi-national regulations and laws in
multiple jurisdictions;
•discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions;
•changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies, or other limits on our ability to import raw
materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;
•challenges associated with cross-border product distribution;
•changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the
potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;
•risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries
in which we operate;
•the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application, and
enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;
•risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency exchange markets and the decisions made and positions taken to hedge such
volatility;
•changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;
•greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and
15
•design, implementation, and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base.
In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption,
expropriation, and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. Slow economic
growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could
adversely impact our profitability. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do business.
Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other
nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the legal and regulatory
effects of Brexit, changes to major international trade arrangements (e.g., the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), and the imposition of tariffs by
certain foreign governments, including China and Canada, in response to the imposition of tariffs or modification of trade relationships by the United States,
could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the United States and in international locations where we do
business include export and import restrictions, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, cash repatriation restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign
ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, and political unrest. Such factors in either domestic or
foreign jurisdictions, and our responses to them, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. For further
information on Venezuela, see Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global
workforce.
We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability
to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within
and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel and a diverse
global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. Unplanned turnover, failure to attract and develop personnel
with key emerging capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing skills, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions,
including the Chief Executive Officer position, could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Changes in immigration laws
and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. Any such loss, failure, or limitation could adversely affect our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
We are significantly dependent on information technology, and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption,
misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to
manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information
technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These
information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to
hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or
by cyber-attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions,
reputational damage, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation
or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers,
consumers, or suppliers.
16
Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of
opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts
and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated
confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and
increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach
or to repair or replace networks and information systems.
Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers, distributors, or regulators operate.
We have been and may in the future be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or tsunamis that
could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, distributors, or regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our
facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of
our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse
effects on our results of operations. While we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to
manage business continuity planning, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or
other disasters or that our business continuity plans will effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a
single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our
supply chain.
The Sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.
As of December 29, 2018, the Sponsors own approximately 49% of our common stock. Four of our current 11 directors had been directors of Heinz prior to
the closing of the 2015 Merger and remained directors of Kraft Heinz pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition, the Board elected Joao M. Castro-Neves,
a partner of 3G Capital, one of the Sponsors, effective June 12, 2019. Furthermore, some of our executive officers, including Bernardo Hees, our Chief
Executive Officer, are partners of 3G Capital. As a result, the Sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control
over decisions of our Board of Directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting any
amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets. In addition, to the extent
that the Sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock, they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent
to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions, such as corporate transactions, that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding
common stock. The directors designated by the Sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure, including the
issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the decision of whether
to declare dividends and the amount of any such dividends. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from
time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that
may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to own a
significant amount of our equity, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.
Financial Risks
Our level of indebtedness, as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business and financial
condition.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Our
existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements,
acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;
•resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, including our commercial paper programs; liquidity;
and access to capital markets;
•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as
highly leveraged;
17
•making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;
•requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, payments of dividends, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;
•exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency, as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and substantially all of
our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars; and
•in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us
to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity.
There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or
to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving
credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”) to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)). The
creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity
of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and file our
periodic reports with the SEC, we have needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to
avoid being in default.
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility. As previously disclosed, we entered into two waiver agreements with respect to the Senior Credit Facility,
pursuant to which the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted temporary waivers of
compliance by us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29,
2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than July 31, 2019. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29,
2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July
31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.
For further information related to the two waiver agreements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
However, we may not be able to secure similar waivers for any future delays in our periodic reports with the SEC. Furthermore, if we breach any covenants
under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors, or we may not be able to remedy
compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and
unable to access our Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain creditors could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation.
Additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and
results of operations.
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units, and our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We
test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained
decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to
regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural
disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, or significant adverse
changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its
carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the
case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.
18
As detailed in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as a result of our 2018 annual impairment
test in the second quarter of 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $133 million and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $101
million. Additionally, as part of our interim impairment test in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of
$215 million and a definite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $3 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts.
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.
While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units and brands were below their carrying amounts. These factors
included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net
assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected
supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018, which provided
additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years, such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November
2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada, which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the
associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase
in the United States in December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as
of the end of December 2018.
Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test on these reporting units and brands as of December 29, 2018. As a result of our interim impairment
test, we recognized goodwill impairment losses of $6.9 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of
2018.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic,
and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth
rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the
development of our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. As detailed in
Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we recorded impairment losses totaling $15.9 billion for
the year ended December 29, 2018. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in
zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, these and other individual reporting units and
brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any
assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Reporting units with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: U.S. Grocery, U.S. Refrigerated, Canada Retail, Latin America Exports, Southeast
Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Northeast Asia. Of the $29.0 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $9.3 billion is attributable to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Brands with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate carrying amount of
$29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip, Stove Top, ABC, and
Quero. Of the $29.3 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $24.0 billion is attributable to brands with 0% excess fair value over carrying
amount. Although the remaining reporting units and brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment
testing date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to
impairments, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth.
19
Our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety
of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Brazilian real,
Indonesian rupiah, Chinese renminbi, and Indian rupee. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates
from period to period will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue
to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are
paid in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could
significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Commodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable
oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, wheat products, cucumbers, onions, other fruits and vegetables, spices, and flour to manufacture our products.
In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, cardboard, glass, plastic, paper, fiberboard, and other materials to package our
products, and we use other inputs, such as natural gas and water, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, which influence both
our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to
predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, crop failures, or shortages due to plant
disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative
energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect
to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our
operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in cross-currency transaction rates. Rising
commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and
distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price
increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures
markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other
supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover
these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes, or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer
pressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input
price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in
our gross profit and net income.
We use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans,
sugar, vegetable oils, wheat products, corn products, cocoa products, packaging products, diesel fuel, and natural gas. We recognize gains and losses based on
changes in the values of these commodity derivatives. We recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income
to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process. We recognize these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment
operating results until we sell the underlying products, at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results. Accordingly, changes in
the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income.
Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.
Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States, Canada, and other foreign
jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension
plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of
benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.
20
Furthermore, we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained
agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes
or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United States.
Regulatory Risks
Compliance with laws, regulations, and related interpretations and related legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could impact our
business, and we face additional risks and uncertainties related to any potential actions resulting from the SEC’s ongoing investigation, as well as
potential additional subpoenas, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.
As a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly-evolving legal and regulatory frameworks.
Various laws and regulations govern production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling, including on-pack claims, information or disclosures,
marketing, licensing, trade, labor, tax, environmental matters, privacy, as well as health and safety and data protection practices. Government authorities
regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. In particular, Brexit could result in a new regulatory regime in the United Kingdom that may
or may not follow that of the European Union, and the creation of new and divergent laws and regulations could increase the cost and complexity of our
compliance. In addition, this shift in regime could create a number of legal and accounting complexities with respect to existing relationships, including
uncertainty regarding the continuity of contracts entered into by entities in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Our compliance with new or revised
laws and regulations, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, we are faced with a heightened risk of
legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions.
As previously disclosed on February 21, 2019, we received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC related to our procurement area, specifically the
accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and
changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with external counsel and forensic
accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters.
Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019, when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible
asset impairments, the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting, internal controls, and disclosures, our assessment of goodwill
and intangible asset impairments, and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern District of Illinois also is reviewing this matter, working with the SEC and receiving materials from it. After our earnings release, four securities
class action lawsuits, one class action lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), and five stockholder derivative actions were
filed against us and certain of our current and former officers, directors, and employees. One of the securities class action lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed
without prejudice, while the other matters are still pending.
We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. We are unable, at this time, to estimate our potential liability in these matters, but we may be required
to pay judgments, settlements, or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses in connection with the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits and the
stockholder derivative actions. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 18, Commitment and Contingencies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Furthermore, if the SEC commences legal action as a result of the investigation, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to
injunctions, cease and desist orders, and other equitable remedies. The SEC investigation will not be resolved as a result of the completion of the internal
investigation and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory
investigation.
We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the internal
investigation, the SEC investigation, and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses, the delay in timely filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
the delay in timely filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, and the diversion of the attention of the
management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial
condition, and cash flows.
As a result of matters associated with the internal investigation related to the SEC investigation and various lawsuits, we are exposed to greater risks
associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings, and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional
lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
21
We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we
experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may
not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the price of our common stock may decline.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the
effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other
rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to
furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public
accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
In connection with our most recent year-end assessment of internal control over financial reporting, we determined that, as of December 29, 2018, we did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness in our risk assessment process related to designing and maintaining
controls sufficient to appropriately respond to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to material
weaknesses arising from (i) supplier contracts and related arrangements, and (ii) goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, and we
have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. For further discussion of the material weaknesses
identified and our remedial efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.
Remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. As a result, we may not
be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management, be able to do so in a timely manner, or
be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future.
If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting,
the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, our access to capital markets, the perceptions of our
creditworthiness, and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable
securities laws, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements
regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial
reporting; we may suffer defaults, accelerations, or cross-accelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to
obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches; and our stock price may decline.
Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, restricts our
ability to issue equity securities, including within the Kraft Heinz Savings Plan and the Kraft Heinz Union Savings Plan (collectively, the “Plan”), and
could impact our listing on Nasdaq.
We did not file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018 or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
March 30, 2019 within each respective timeframe required by the SEC, meaning we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC.
This limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business
strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would
allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use “shelf” registration statements to conduct
offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering now, we would be
required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer
than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and the necessity of using a Form S-1 for a public offering of registered
securities could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete
acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.
22
In addition, as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8 registration
statements. As a result, on April 23, 2019, the administrator of the Plan issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during
which participants are prohibited from acquiring beneficial ownership of additional interests in The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund. If we are not able to
become and remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, it restricts our ability to maintain The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund or issue
other equity securities to our employees.
As previously disclosed, we also received notices from Nasdaq regarding our noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed
companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We timely submitted our plan to regain compliance, and Nasdaq granted the
Company until September 11, 2019 to regain compliance, subject to our compliance with certain terms outlined in the notice received on May 15, 2019,
including filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended March 30, 2019, which we expect to file as promptly as practicable following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are not able
to file before September 11, 2019, however, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.
We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may
affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues.
As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial
Data (Unaudited), in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and to restate each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods for the nine months ended
September 29, 2018 and for fiscal year 2017, following the identification of misstatements as a result of the internal investigation conducted. We do not
believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of
the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions,
suppliers, and procurement employees involved, we determined that it would be appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued
consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and
uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods. As a result, we have incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or
related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of
our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyrights, and
licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of
patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and trade dress laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and
policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our
products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property,
may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition. We also license certain intellectual property, most notably
trademarks, from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with
these third parties, our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted.
We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or
other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business
operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to
significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
23
Changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on
the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable
tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the
interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the United States, which represents the
majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms
that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax
rate, our deferred income taxes, and the taxation of foreign earnings. The comprehensive impact of U.S. Tax Reform is yet to be determined, and future
guidance and interpretations may have adverse or uncertain effects. Relatedly, changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development’s (“OECD”) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing (“BEPS”) could impact our effective tax rate. It is
not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact
on our business and financial condition.
Significant judgment, knowledge, and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is
impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in geographic mix of income, increases
in expenses not deductible for tax, including impairment of goodwill, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we
believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical
income tax provisions and accruals. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more
difficult. The results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
Registered Securities Risks
Sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, sales of our common stock by the Sponsors, or the perception that these
sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity
securities. A sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened (in November and December 2018, which was a contributing factor
to our decision to perform an interim impairment test for certain reporting units and brands in the fourth quarter of 2018, for which we ultimately recorded
impairment losses) and could in the future happen, which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets, which could increase
the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
Kraft Heinz, 3G Capital, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all
registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsors as of the date of the
closing of the 2015 Merger. As of December 29, 2018, registrable shares represented approximately 49% of all outstanding shares of our common stock.
Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods, the registrable shares are not subject to a “lock-up” or similar
restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement. Sales of our common stock by the Sponsors
to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our
common stock.
Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and
may be limited by our financial condition, debt agreements, or limitations under Delaware law.
Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof
will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, income, legal
requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, debt agreements, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors has
decided, and may in the future decide, in its sole discretion, to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely.
For these reasons, shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our
common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.
24
Volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business.
Changes in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, uncertainty regarding Brexit, and interest rate volatility, including as
a result of the use or discontinued use of certain benchmark rates such as LIBOR, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing
maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these ratings
could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.
Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger
customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some
customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or
counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate co-headquarters are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois. Our co-headquarters are leased and house certain executive
offices, our U.S. business units, and our administrative, finance, legal, and human resource functions. We maintain additional owned and leased offices
throughout the regions in which we operate.
We manufacture our products in our network of manufacturing and processing facilities located throughout the world. As of December 29, 2018, we operated
84 manufacturing and processing facilities. We own 81 and lease three of these facilities. Our manufacturing and processing facilities count by segment as of

(a)As previously disclosed, we adopted a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018, and at the same time, we retrospectively corrected immaterial
misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications. This resulted in net sales decreases of $147 million in 2017, $152
million in 2016, and $55 million in 2015.
(b)The increases in net sales in 2016 and in 2015 compared to the prior year, and the increases in total assets and long-term debt from December 28, 2014 to January 3, 2016, were primarily driven
by the 2015 Merger.
27
(c)We have restated previously disclosed consolidated financial data for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, as well as the related balance sheet dates, to correct misstatements principally related to
supplier contracts and related arrangements, as well as other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements. See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial
Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
(d)The increases in income/(loss), income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders, and basic and diluted income/(loss) per common share in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily driven by
U.S. Tax Reform, which was enacted in December 2017. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
(e)The decreases in income/(loss), income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders, and basic and diluted income/(loss) per common share in 2018 compared to 2017, and the decrease in total
assets from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018, were primarily driven by non-cash impairment losses in 2018. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
(f)Amounts exclude the current portion of long-term debt.
(g)On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our 9.00% cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A (“Series A Preferred Stock”). See Equity and Dividends in Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, along with Note 19, Debt, and Note 20, Capital Stock, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.
(h)On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31, 2016, we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year
ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. In prior years, we operated on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending the Sunday closest to December 31. As a result, we
occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Our 2015 fiscal year includes a 53rd week of activity.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements:
We have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to the “Explanatory Note”
preceding Item 1, Business, for background on the restatement, the fiscal periods impacted, control considerations, and other information.
In addition, we have restated certain previously reported financial information at December 30, 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016 in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including but not limited to
information within the Consolidated Results of Operations, Results of Operations by Segment, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures sections. We have also
included certain restated quarterly information in the Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information section at the end of this item.
See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional
information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the misstatements and the impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
Description of the Company:
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products throughout the world.
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and EMEA. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two operating segments: Latin America and
APAC.
Our segments reflect a change, effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018, to reorganize our international businesses to better align our global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical AMEA operating segment into the historical Europe reportable segment,
forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became the APAC operating segment. We have
reflected this change in all historical periods presented.
See Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the consolidated financial statements for our financial
information by segment.
28
Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results
Impairment Losses:
Our 2018 results reflect goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses of $15.9 billion compared to $49 million in 2017. The increase was primarily driven
by impairment losses of $15.5 billion recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts.
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.
While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units and brands were below their carrying amounts. These factors
included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net
assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected
supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018, which provided
additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years, such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November
2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada, which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the
associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase
in the United States in December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as
of the end of December 2018.
As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts, we performed an
interim impairment test as of December 29, 2018. As a result of our interim impairment test, we recognized goodwill impairment losses of $6.9 billion and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
See Critical Accounting Estimates within this item and Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
U.S. Tax Reform:
U.S. Tax Reform legislation enacted by the federal government on December 22, 2017 significantly changed U.S. tax laws by, among other things, lowering
the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there were many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, revised deductions for
executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), and a
deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018, we accounted for this
anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion in 2017.
As a result, U.S. Tax Reform significantly impacted our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes and our effective tax rate, primarily in 2017, resulting in a
lack of comparability year over year.
See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Integration and Restructuring Expenses:
At the end of 2017, we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the “Integration Program”), which was
designed to reduce costs and integrate and optimize our combined organization. As of December 29, 2018, we had incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of
$2,146 million related to the Integration Program. These costs primarily included severance and employee benefit costs (including cash and non-cash
severance), costs to exit facilities (including non-cash costs such as accelerated depreciation), and other costs incurred as a direct result of integration
activities. Approximately 60% of total Integration Program costs were cash expenditures. As of December 29, 2018, we had incurred approximately $1.4
billion in capital expenditures related to the Integration Program since its inception in 2015.
Related to our restructuring activities, including the Integration Program, we recognized expenses of $460 million in 2018, $434 million in 2017, and $1.0
billion in 2016. Integration Program expenses included in these totals were $92 million in 2018, $316 million, in 2017, and $887 million in 2016.
See Note 6, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Results of Operations
We disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a
consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our
underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations from our consolidated financial statements see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
The restatement described in the Overview section within this item did not significantly impact the drivers of our consolidated results of operations or our
results of operations by segment. See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.
In addition, during the period between December 29, 2018 and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain industry trends impacting our results of
operations as described herein, including increased costs in procurement and logistics, pricing pressure as a result of increased private label competition, and
consumer trends focused on health and wellness, have continued.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:
Net sales increased 0.7% to $26.3 billion in 2018 compared to $26.1 billion in 2017, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.6 pp) and the net
favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (0.4 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 0.9% to $26.1 billion in 2018 compared to $25.9 billion in 2017 driven
by favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp). Volume/mix was favorable in all segments. Pricing was flat, with lower pricing in the United States and Canada offset by
higher pricing in Rest of World (primarily driven by highly inflationary environments in certain markets within Latin America) and EMEA.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:
Net sales decreased 0.9% to $26.1 billion in 2017 compared to $26.3 billion in 2016. The impacts of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures were
flat. Organic Net Sales decreased 0.9% to $26.0 billion in 2017 compared to $26.2 billion in 2016 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.5 pp), partially offset by
higher pricing (0.6 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable in the United States and Canada, partially offset by growth in Rest of World and EMEA. Higher pricing
in Rest of World and the United States was partially offset by lower pricing in Canada and EMEA.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:
Operating income/(loss) decreased 268.7% to a loss of $10.2 billion in 2018 compared to income of $6.1 billion in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to
higher impairment losses in 2018. Impairment losses were $15.9 billion in 2018 compared to $49 million in 2017. The remaining $390 million decrease in
operating income/(loss) was due to higher input costs and strategic investments. These decreases to operating income/(loss) were partially offset by lower
Integration Program and other restructuring expenses, the favorable impact of foreign currency (4.2 pp), the benefit from the postemployment benefits
accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018, savings from Integration Program and other restructuring activities, and productivity savings. See Note
10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our impairment losses.
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders decreased 193.2% to a loss of $10.2 billion in 2018 compared to income of $10.9 billion in 2017. The
decrease was primarily due to the operating income/(loss) factors described above (primarily higher impairment losses in 2018), as well as a lower tax benefit,
unfavorable changes in other expense/(income), net, and higher interest expense, which are detailed as follows:
•The effective tax rate was a benefit of 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss compared to a benefit of 100.6% in 2017 on pre-tax income. The 2018 effective
tax rate was lower, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate, non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments, nonmonetary
currency devaluation losses, and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans), the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our deferred
tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform, which were partially offset by the benefit from intangible asset impairment
losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information
related to our effective tax rates.
•Other expense/(income), net was income of $183 million in 2018 compared to income of $627 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a
$162 million non-cash settlement charge in 2018 related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans
compared to a $177 million non-cash curtailment gain from postretirement plan remeasurements in 2017. In addition, this decrease was due to a
$146 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss in the current period compared to a $36 million loss in the prior period related to our
Venezuelan operations. See Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
additional information.
•Interest expense was $1.3 billion in 2018 compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $3.0 billion aggregate principal
amount of long-term debt issued in June 2018. See Note 19, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional
information.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.3% to $7.0 billion in 2018 compared to $7.7 billion in 2017, primarily due to higher input costs, strategic investments, higher
overhead costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.5 pp), partially offset by savings from Integration Program and other restructuring
activities, and productivity savings.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:
Operating income/(loss) increased 8.1% to $6.1 billion in 2017 compared to $5.6 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by savings from the
Integration Program and other restructuring activities, lower Integration Program and other restructuring expenses in 2017, and lower overhead costs, partially
offset by higher input costs in local currency, lower Organic Net Sales, lower unrealized gains on commodity hedges in 2017, and the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency (0.4 pp).
31
Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased 220.3% to $10.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.4 billion in 2016. The increase was
primarily driven by U.S. Tax Reform, the operating income/(loss) factors discussed above, the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend in 2017, and
favorable changes in other expense/(income), net, partially offset by higher interest expense, detailed as follows:
•The effective tax rate was a 100.6% benefit in 2017 compared to 27.0% expense in 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven
by the $7.0 billion tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform, lower tax benefits associated with deferred tax effects of statutory rate changes, and taxes on
income of foreign subsidiaries in 2017. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional
information related to our effective tax rates.
•The Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed on June 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no dividends for 2017, compared to $180 million in
2016. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information.
•Other expense/(income), net was $627 million of income in 2017 compared to $472 million of income in 2016. This increase was primarily driven
by a $177 million non-cash curtailment gain from postretirement plan remeasurements in 2017. This was partially offset by a $36 million
nonmonetary currency devaluation loss in 2017 compared to $24 million in 2016 related to our Venezuelan operations. See Note 16, Venezuela -
Foreign Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
•Interest expense increased to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the May 2016 issuances of
long-term debt and borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which began in the second quarter of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.2% to $7.7 billion in 2017 compared to $7.6 billion in 2016, primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and
other restructuring activities and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.2
pp), and a decline in Organic Net Sales.

Adjusted EPS increased 0.3% to $3.51 in 2018 compared to $3.50 in 2017, driven by lower taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period, the benefit from
the postemployment benefits accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and the effect of dilutive equity awards, partially offset by lower
Adjusted EBITDA, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization in the current period. We have excluded the effect of dilutive equity
awards in 2018 as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS because of the net loss attributable to common shareholders. In 2017, the
effect of dilutive equity awards was included.

Adjusted EBITDA growth despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by higher interest expense.
Results of Operations by Segment
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and segment adjusted earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, and amortization (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations
before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and
restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs,
unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the
gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, other gains/(losses)
related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity
award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and
investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our
underlying operations.
Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar. As a result, we must revalue the results of our
Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S. dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (“DICOM”) rates,
and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are
recorded in current net income and are classified within other expense/(income), net as nonmonetary currency devaluation. See Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign
Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:
Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 0.6% to $18.1 billion in 2018 compared to $18.2 billion in 2017 primarily due to lower pricing (0.9 pp), partially
offset by favorable volume/mix (0.3 pp). Pricing was lower across most categories, particularly in ready-to-drink beverages, cheese, and meat, partially offset
by increases in boxed dinners and condiments and sauces. Favorable volume/mix across several categories, particularly in ready-to-drink beverages, was
partially offset by lower shipments in cheese.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.2% to $5.2 billion in 2018 compared to $5.9 billion in 2017 primarily due to non-key commodity cost inflation,
lower Organic Net Sales, strategic investments, and higher overhead costs, partially offset by favorable key commodity costs, and Integration Program
savings.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:
Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.3% to $18.2 billion in 2018 compared to $18.5 billion in 2017 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.8 pp), partially
offset by higher pricing (0.5 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily driven by distribution losses in nuts, cheese, and meat, and lower shipments in
foodservice. The decline was partially offset by gains in refrigerated meal combinations, boxed dinners, and frozen meals. Pricing was higher driven primarily
by price increases in cheese.
36
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.2% to $5.9 billion in 2017 compared to $5.7 billion in 2016 primarily driven by Integration Program savings and
lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, as well as unfavorable volume/mix.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:
Net sales decreased 0.2% to $2.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.3 pp). Organic Net
Sales increased 0.1% to $2.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017 driven by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (0.6
pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in cheese and coffee, primarily due to earlier execution of go-to-market agreements
with key retailers, partially offset by lower shipments in condiments and sauces. Lower pricing in cheese was partially offset by increases across a number of
categories, particularly in foodservice.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.4% to $608 million in 2018 compared to $636 million in 2017, partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
currency (0.3 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower pricing, higher overhead costs, and higher
input costs in local currency.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:
Net sales decreased 5.4% to $2.2 billion in 2017 compared to $2.3 billion in 2016, despite the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.9 pp). Organic Net
Sales decreased 7.3% to $2.1 billion in 2017 compared to $2.3 billion in 2016 due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.5 pp) and lower pricing (1.8 pp).
Volume/mix was unfavorable across several categories and was most pronounced in cheese, coffee, and boxed dinners, primarily due to delayed execution of
go-to-market agreements with key retailers, retail distribution losses (primarily in cheese), and lower inventory levels at retail versus the prior year. Lower
pricing was due to higher promotional activity, primarily in cheese.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.7% to $636 million in 2017 compared to $632 million in 2016, despite the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7
pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower Organic Net Sales partially offset by Integration Program
savings and lower overhead costs in 2017.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:
Net sales increased 5.1% to $2.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.6 billion in 2017 driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency (2.5 pp), partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (1.5 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 4.1% to $2.6 billion in 2018 compared to $2.5 billion in 2017
driven by favorable volume/mix (3.2 pp) and higher pricing (0.9 pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces,
including the addition of Kraft products in certain regions, and gains in foodservice. Pricing was higher, primarily driven by higher pricing in Middle East and
Africa, and favorable timing of promotional activity versus the prior year in the UK, partially offset by lower pricing in eastern Europe.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% to $724 million in 2018 compared to $673 million in 2017, including the favorable impact of foreign currency
(3.2 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the increase was primarily driven by Organic Net Sales growth, productivity savings, and the benefit from the
postemployment benefits accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher supply chain costs in the Middle East and Africa.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:
Net sales were flat at $2.6 billion in 2017 and in 2016, despite the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (0.5 pp) and acquisitions and divestitures (0.3 pp).
Organic Net Sales increased 0.8% to $2.5 billion in 2017 compared to $2.5 billion in 2016 driven by favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by lower
pricing (0.5 pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in foodservice and growth in condiments and sauces, partially offset by
ongoing declines in infant nutrition in Italy. Pricing was lower, primarily driven by higher promotional activity in the UK and Italy versus the prior period,
partially offset by higher pricing in the Middle East and Africa.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9.3% to $673 million in 2017 compared to $741 million in 2016, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
(1.4 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the decrease was due to higher input costs in local currency, partially offset by productivity savings.

increased 7.9% to $3.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.9 billion in 2017 driven by higher pricing (5.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (2.5 pp). Pricing was
higher primarily driven by highly inflationary environments in certain markets within Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was driven by growth across
several categories, which was most pronounced in condiments and sauces, partially offset by lower shipments in Southeast Asia.

Net sales increased 4.8% to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion in 2016, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.8 pp, including 2.0
pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Organic Net Sales increased 5.6% to $3.0 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion in 2016 driven by
higher pricing (4.2 pp) and favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local
currency, primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions partially offset by
volume/mix declines in several markets associated with distributor network re-alignment.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.0% to $590 million in 2017 compared to $621 million in 2016, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
(2.9 pp, including 3.5 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily
due to higher input costs in local currency and higher commercial investments, partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies
we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting
policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that
occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions
to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We
recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable
consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to
customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period
experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to
operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual
experience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $584 million in 2018, $629 million in 2017, and $708 million in 2016, which
represented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. The decrease in advertising expenses in 2018
compared to 2017 was driven by a shift from traditional ad spaces to non-traditional ad spaces. We also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as
shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs were $1,140
million in 2018, $1,115 million in 2017, and $1,221 million in 2016.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying amount of $36.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. Our indefinite-lived
intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $44.0 billion as of December 29,
2018.
39
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a
sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for
example due to regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example
due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, or
significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each
reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and
carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic,
and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth
rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the
development of our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. As detailed in
Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we recorded impairment losses totaling $15.9 billion for
the year ended December 29, 2018. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in
zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, these and other individual reporting units and
brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any
assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Reporting units with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: U.S. Grocery, U.S. Refrigerated, Canada Retail, Latin America Exports, Southeast
Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Northeast Asia. Of the $29.0 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $9.3 billion is attributable to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Brands with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate carrying amount of
$29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip, Stove Top, ABC, and
Quero. Of the $29.3 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $24.0 billion is attributable to brands with 0% excess fair value over carrying
amount. Although the remaining reporting units and brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment
testing date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to
impairments.
We generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Some of the more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit (including net sales,
cost of products sold, SG&A, depreciation and amortization, working capital, and capital expenditures), income tax rates, long-term growth rates, and a
discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using
historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management’s plans, and guideline
companies.
We generally utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands. Some of the more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales, cost of
products sold, and SG&A), contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount rate that reflects the level of risk
associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in
the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates,
management’s plans, and guideline companies.
We generally utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands. Some of the more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand, royalty rates (as a percentage of net
sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee), income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount
rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely.
We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated
product category growth rates, management’s plans, and guideline companies.
40
The discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates we used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair
value over carrying amount, as of the latest 2018 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand, were as follows:
 Goodwill Carrying
Value
(in billions) Discount Rate  Long-Term Growth Rate  Royalty Rate
  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum  Maximum
Reporting units $ 29.0 7.0% 10.7% 1.5% 4.7%    
Brands
(excess earnings method) 24.4 7.5% 7.5% 0.8% 2.1%    
Brands
(relief from royalty method) 4.9 7.5% 10.2% 0.5% 4.0% 1.0% 20.0%
Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts
and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in
isolation. However, as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur, as a sensitivity measure, we have presented the estimated effects of
isolated changes in discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates for our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying
amount. If we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying
amount, as of the latest testing date for each of these reporting units and brands, these isolated changes, which are reasonably possible to occur, would have
led to the following increase/(decrease) in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands (in billions):
 Discount Rate  Long-Term Growth Rate  Royalty Rate
 50-Basis-Point  25-Basis-Point  100-Basis-Point
 Increase  Decrease  Increase  Decrease  Increase  Decrease
Reporting units(a) $ (5.3) $ 6.3 $ 2.6 $ (2.4)    
Brands (excess earnings method)(a) (1.9) 2.3 0.9 (0.8)    
Brands (relief from royalty method)(a) (0.4) 0.5 0.2 (0.2) $ 0.4 $ (0.4)
(a)A reduction in fair value would not necessarily cause an impairment in all cases, but due to the low or zero excess fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units and brands, it is
reasonably possible that a reduction in fair value would lead to an impairment.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details related to our 2018 impairment testing.
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform a qualitative assessment each interim reporting period to determine
if it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is below its carrying amount. While we have not completed such impairment assessment
for the first fiscal quarter of 2019, nor have we completed our 2019 annual impairment testing as of the first day of our second fiscal quarter, it is reasonably
possible that an impairment of certain reporting units or brands could occur based on continued industry trends impacting our results of operations.
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income), net in future periods using the corridor
approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive.
41
For our postretirement benefit plans, our 2019 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.7%. We established this rate based upon our most recent
experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%.
The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2019 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the
following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 29, 2018 (in millions):
 One-Percentage-Point
 Increase  (Decrease)
Effect on annual service and interest cost $ 3 $ (3)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 48 (41)
Our 2019 discount rate assumption will be 4.3% for service cost and 4.1% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 discount rate assumption
will be 4.6% for service cost and 4.4% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 3.4% for service cost and 3.3% for interest cost for our non-U.S.
pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future
cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.
In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement benefit
plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components. We now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the
specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost
and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the
period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit
cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We accounted for this
change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
Our 2019 expected return on plan assets will be 5.4% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 expected rate of return on plan assets
will be 5.7% for our U.S. pension plans and 5.4% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan
assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to
maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments.
While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2019 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, as a sensitivity
measure, a 100-basis-point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following
effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions):
 U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans
 100-Basis-Point  100-Basis-Point
 Increase  Decr ease  Increase  Decr ease
Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ 11 $ (17) $ (2) $ (7)

Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement costs (8) 1 — (1)
Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on postretirement costs (10) 10 — —
42
Income Taxes:
We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn
income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for
tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that
we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax
benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the
impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information that has become
available after the balance sheet date, however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial
statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of
benefit recognized for financial reporting. These unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be
material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 4, New Accounting Standards, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
Contingencies
See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of our contingencies.
Commodity Trends
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable
oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, and wheat products to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of
resins, metals, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of
these commodities.
We define our key commodities in the United States and Canada as dairy, meat, coffee, and nuts. In 2018, we experienced cost decreases for dairy, coffee, and
meat, while costs for nuts increased. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk
management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends.
Dairy commodities, primarily milk and cheese, are the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy raw material
requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as well as government
programs, significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components of our meat products include pork, beef, and
poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the
prices of these meat products. The most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans, which we purchase on global markets. Quality and
availability of supply, currency fluctuations, and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices. The most significant cost components in
our nut products include peanuts, cashews, and almonds, which we purchase on both domestic and global markets, where global market supply and demand is
the primary driver of prices.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
our working capital needs, future contractual obligations (including repayments of long-term debt), payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends, planned
capital expenditures, restructuring expenditures, and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans. An additional potential source of liquidity is access
to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. Overall, while, as noted above, we
are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3, we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material
effect on our short-term or long-term liquidity.
43
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility and certain indentures. As a result, we obtained temporary waivers from certain creditors under our indebtedness
instruments. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated
financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019. See the “Total Debt” section below for additional information.
Cash Flow Activity for 2018 Compared to 2017:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $501 million for the year ended December 30,
2017. This increase was primarily driven by decreased postemployment benefit contributions in 2018, the timing of income tax payments, higher collections
on trade receivables as fewer were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables in connection with the unwind of all of our accounts receivable securitization and
factoring programs (the “Programs”) in 2018, and decreased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2018. These increases in cash provided by operating
activities were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $288 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30,
2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections on previously sold receivables of $990 million, as we unwound all of our Programs in 2018,
and cash payments to acquire businesses in 2018, primarily Cerebos Pacific Limited. These decreases in cash provided by investing activities were partially
offset by decreased capital expenditures, which was driven by the wind-up of Integration Program footprint costs in the prior year. We expect 2019 capital
expenditures to be approximately $800 million. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including Note 17, Financing Arrangements,
for additional information on our Programs, Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information on our 2018 acquisitions, and Note 6,
Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information on the Integration Program.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $3.4 billion for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017.
This decrease was primarily driven by increased proceeds from long-term debt issuances, which more than offset increased cash distributions related to our
dividends, higher net repayments of commercial paper, and higher repayments of long-term debt. See Note 19, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for additional information on our long-term debt issuances and repayments. See Equity and Dividends in this item for additional
information on our dividends.
Cash Flow Activity for 2017 Compared to 2016:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $501 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the $1.2 billion pre-funding of our postretirement benefit plans in 2017,
lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term
renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year, and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our pre-funding of postretirement plan benefits following
U.S. Tax Reform enactment on December 22, 2017.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from our Programs, as well as lower proceeds from cash
settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures were flat in 2017 compared to 2016.
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The decrease was driven by the benefit of fewer dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016, which more than offset higher net repayments of long-term
debt and commercial paper in 2017 compared to 2016, including cash outflows associated with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock in 2016.
Dividend payments were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend and the impact of four common stock
cash distributions in 2017 compared to five such distributions in 2016. See Equity and Dividends for additional information on cash distributions related to
common stock and Series A Preferred Stock.
44
Cash Held by International Subsidiaries:
Of the $1.1 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018, $923 million was held by international subsidiaries.
We consider the unremitted current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely
reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately
$20 million.
Our historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 30, 2017 are undistributed and currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As of
December 29, 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2 billion of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will be
owed when this cash is distributed.
Total Debt:
We obtain funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. At December 29, 2018, we had no commercial paper outstanding. At
December 30, 2017, we had commercial paper outstanding of $448 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%. The maximum amount of
commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 29, 2018 was $1.1 billion.
We maintain our $4.0 billion Senior Credit Facility, and subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add
additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at
December 29, 2018, at December 30, 2017, or during the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. In June 2018, we
entered into an agreement that became effective on July 6, 2018 to extend the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 6, 2021 to July 6, 2023 and
to establish a $400 million euro equivalent swing line facility, which is available under the $4.0 billion revolving credit facility limit for short-term loans
denominated in euros on a same-day basis. The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of
facilities and could upon the occurrence of certain events of default restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all
financial covenants during the year ended December 29, 2018.
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.
However, as previously disclosed, on March 22, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the “Original Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit
Facility, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by
us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Pursuant
to the Original Waiver, we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14, 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial
reporting, on May 10, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the “Second Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility, pursuant to which
the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us
with respect to the requirements to furnish the lenders copies of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and for the
fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019. Pursuant to the Second Waiver and in order to remedy our noncompliance, we are required to provide consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than
July 31, 2019. If we had not obtained these waivers, we would not have been able to access our Senior Credit Facility.
Our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $31.1 billion at December 29, 2018 and $31.0 billion at December 30, 2017. Our long-term debt
contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the year ended December 29,
2018.
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under certain indentures. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.
45
Under our existing indentures, if we do not file required reports within specified time periods, the trustee or holders of at least 30% in the case of our Second
Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and 25% in the case of any other series of notes may deliver a notice of default for such series of notes which would
commence the applicable cure period under such indenture. As of June 5, 2019, none of the cure periods under our existing indentures have been triggered in
connection with our failure to comply with the respective reporting covenants set forth in such indentures. However, if a cure period is triggered under such
indentures and we fail to file our annual and interim financial statements within such cure period, any outstanding notes issued thereunder would become
callable.
Our senior notes maturing in 2019 and 2020 include aggregate principal amounts of approximately $350 million in August 2019, approximately $900 million
in February 2020, and approximately 800 million Canadian dollars and $1.5 billion in July 2020. We expect to fund these long-term debt repayments
primarily with cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities, proceeds from our divestiture in Canada, and potential new issuances of short-term
or long-term debt.
See Note 19, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information related to our long-term debt.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
We have utilized accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient liquidity. During
2018, we had Programs in place in various countries across the globe. In the second quarter of 2018, we unwound our U.S. securitization program, which
represented the majority of our Programs, using proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in June 2018. As of December 29, 2018, we have unwound all
of our Programs.
See Note 17, Financing Arrangements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of our Programs and other financing
arrangements.
Aggregate Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 29, 2018 (in millions):
 Payments Due
 2019  2020-2021 2022-2023 2024 and
Thereafter Total
Long-term debt(a) 1,641 6,369 8,046 32,195 48,251
Capital leases(b)(f) 27 98 27 85 237
Operating leases(c)(f) 185 242 119 148 694
Purchase obligations(d)(f) 1,569 1,162 497 217 3,445
Other long-term liabilities(e) 41 83 98 203 425
Total 3,463 7,954 8,787 32,848 53,052
(a)  Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on variable and fixed rate long-term debt. Interest on variable rate long-term debt is calculated based on
interest rates at December 29, 2018.
(b)Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense.
(c)Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal
course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. Arrangements are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction.
Several of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash
payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty
provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current
expectations. We exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above.
(e)Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to U.S. Tax Reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-
term liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the
timing of payments for these items.
(f)As part of the restatement described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, certain amounts
in prior years, if presented, would have been recategorized between capital leases, operating leases, and purchase
46
obligations as well as across future periods. There would have been no impact on the total future contractual obligations as of December 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.
Pension plan contributions were $57 million in 2018. We estimate that 2019 pension plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Beyond 2019, we
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including
changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset
performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension plan contributions for 2019 have been excluded from the above table.
Postretirement benefit plan contributions were $19 million in 2018. We estimate that 2019 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately
$15 million. Beyond 2019, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Our actual contributions and
plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences
between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated postretirement benefit plan
contributions for 2019 have been excluded from the above table.
At December 29, 2018, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along
with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $445 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of
examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. We are unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net
unrecognized tax benefits from the above table.
Equity and Dividends
Common Stock Dividends:
We paid common stock dividends of $3.2 billion in 2018, $2.9 billion in 2017, and $3.6 billion in 2016. Additionally, on February 21, 2019, our Board of
Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which was payable on March 22, 2019 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2019.
Additionally, on May 21, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which is payable on June 14, 2019 to
holders of record as of May 31, 2019.
The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial
condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
Series A Preferred Stock Dividends:
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we no longer pay any associated dividends, and there
were no such dividend payments in 2018 or 2017. Prior to the redemption, we made cash distributions of $180 million in 2016.
See Note 19, Debt, and Note 20, Capital Stock, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and
Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP
financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures
are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or
other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making
by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our
non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with
meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same
tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental
information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when
considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations
47
to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these
disclosures.
Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We
calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela, for
which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in
comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying
operations.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit
from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when
they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains)
on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.,
remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that
can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes
do not directly reflect our underlying operations.
Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized
losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures
(e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax
expense/(benefit), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. We believe Adjusted EPS
provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.

($697 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line items:
•Cost of products sold included $194 million in 2018, $464 million in 2017, and $699 million in 2016;
•SG&A included $103 million in 2018, $119 million in 2017, and $293 million in 2016; and
•Other expense/(income), net, included expenses of $163 million in 2018, income of $149 million in 2017, and expenses of $20 million in 2016.
(b)Gross expenses included in deal costs were $23 million in 2018 ($19 million after-tax) and $30 million in 2016 ($20 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line
items:
•Cost of products sold included $4 million in 2018 and $3 million in 2016; and
•SG&A included $19 million in 2018 and $27 million in 2016.
(c)Gross expenses/(income) included in unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges were expenses of $21 million in 2018 ($16 million after-tax), expenses of $19 million in 2017 ($12 million
after-tax), and income of $38 million in 2016 ($25 million after-tax) and were recorded in cost of products sold.
(d)Gross expenses included in impairment losses were $15.9 billion in 2018 ($13.8 billion after-tax), $49 million in 2017 ($36 million after-tax), and $71 million in 2016 ($46 million after-tax) and
were recorded in the following income statement line items:
•Cost of products sold included $53 million in 2016; and
•SG&A included $15.9 billion in 2018, $49 million in 2017, and $18 million in 2016.
(e)Gross expenses included in losses/(gains) on sale of business were $15 million in 2018 ($15 million after-tax) and were recorded in SG&A.
(f)Gross expenses included in other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures were $27 million in 2018 ($15 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line
items:
•Interest expense included $3 million in 2018;
•Other expense/(income), net, included $17 million in 2018; and
•Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included $7 million in 2018.
(g)Gross expenses included in nonmonetary currency devaluation were $146 million in 2018 ($146 million after tax), $36 million in 2017 ($36 million after-tax), and $28 million in 2016 ($28
million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line items:
•Cost of products sold included $4 million in 2016; and
•Other expense/(income), net, included $146 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017, and $24 million in 2016.
(h)For Adjusted EPS, we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly, we included adjustments to EPS to include $180 million Series A
Preferred Stock dividends in the first quarter of 2016 (to reflect the March 7, 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015) and to exclude $51 million of Series A
Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was redeemed on June 7, 2016).
(i)U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit) was an expense of $104 million in 2018 and a benefit of $7.0 billion in 2017. Expenses in 2018 primarily related to the revaluation of our
deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform. These expenses were partially offset by net benefits related to changes in U.S. tax reserves, U.S. Tax Reform
measurement period adjustments, changes in estimates of certain 2017 U.S. income tax deductions, and the release of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credits. The benefit in 2017 was
related to the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Supplemental Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information
The following unaudited quarterly financial information is presented to illustrate the effects of the corrections of misstatements to previously reported
quarterly financial information as a result of the restatement. Such corrections of misstatements are described in more detail in Note 2, Restatement of
Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The following unaudited quarterly financial information for the fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2018 September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31,
2018, December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 29, 2018 and our restated audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. This unaudited quarterly
financial information should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The following tables represent the unaudited reconciliation of net sales to Organic Net Sales. Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these
exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that
principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in
commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management
strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative
instruments. See Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 14, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.
When we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our
agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure
we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. All of our non-exchange traded derivative contracts are
governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor
do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
56
Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices: 
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency swap contracts, assuming
a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions):
 December 29,
2018  December 30,
2017
Commodity contracts $ 38 $ 23
Foreign currency contracts 100 173
Cross-currency swap contracts 402 287
It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the
value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the
prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on
debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.
Effect of Hypothetical 1% Fluctuation in LIBOR and CDOR: 
Based on our current variable rate debt balance as of December 29, 2018, a hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR and CDOR would increase our annual interest
expense by approximately $19 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company
 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2018
and December 30, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 29, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a) (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the risk
assessment component of internal control, as the Company did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of material misstatement due to
changes in their business environment. The risk assessment material weakness gave rise to additional material weaknesses as the Company did not design and
maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and related arrangements or to reassess the level of precision used to review the
impairment assessments related to forecasted cash flows used within goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment calculations.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses
referred to above are described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material
weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2018 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has restated its 2017 and 2016 financial statements to correct misstatements.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it presents net periodic benefit costs in 2018.
 
Basis for Opinions
 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
58
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
Organization
On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The
Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global
Food Holdings, LP (“3G Global Food Holdings” and together with its affiliates, “3G Capital”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June
7, 2013.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are
eliminated.
Reportable Segments
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two
operating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
Our segments reflect a change, effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018, to reorganize our international businesses to better align our global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment into
the historical Europe reportable segment, forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became
the APAC operating segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. See Note 22, Segment Reporting, for our financial information
by segment.
Held for Sale
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations, predominantly in Canada and India. At December 29, 2018, we
have classified the assets and liabilities related to these disposal groups as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are
included in assets held for sale within current assets and liabilities held for sale within current liabilities. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for
additional information.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and
expenses. These policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and
assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be
reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market
volatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects
cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions
in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates
and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
We made reclassifications to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.
66
Note 2. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
We have restated herein our audited consolidated financial statements at December 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31,
2016. We have also restated impacted amounts within the accompanying footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Restatement Background
As previously disclosed on February 21, 2019, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in October 2018 related to
our procurement area, specifically the accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to,
agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with
external counsel and forensic accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”),
conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation, which is now
complete and which identified that multiple employees in the procurement area engaged in misconduct, we corrected prior period misstatements that
generally increased the total cost of products sold in prior financial periods. These misstatements principally related to the incorrect timing of when certain
cost and rebate elements associated with supplier contracts and related arrangements were initially recognized.
In connection with the internal investigation, we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other
potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates, incentive payments, and pricing arrangements. The review identified further
misstatements, which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. These misstatements are
described in more detail in restatement reference (a) below.
Our internal investigation and review identified adjustments that resulted in an understatement of cost of products sold totaling $208 million, including
misstatements of $175 million relating to the periods up through September 29, 2018 that are being restated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
misstatements of cost of products sold related to our internal investigation and review included $22 million for fiscal year 2018, $94 million for fiscal year
2017, $35 million for fiscal year 2016, and $24 million for fiscal year 2015. We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period
presented in our prior financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number
of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions, suppliers, and procurement employees involved, we determined that it would be
appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also
included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods.
Accordingly, we have restated herein our consolidated financial statements at December 30, 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. In addition to
the misstatements related to the supplier contracts and related arrangements, including the misstatements related to lease classification described in
restatement reference (b) below, we corrected additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the
aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements were related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications, balance
sheet misclassifications, income taxes, impairments, and other misstatements, all of which are described in more detail in restatement references (c) through
(g) below.
The restated interim financial information for the relevant unaudited interim financial information for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June
30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017, is included in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Information
(Unaudited). The categories of misstatements and their impact on our previously issued consolidated financial statements are described in more detail below.
67
Description of Misstatements
Misstatements Associated with Supplier Contracts and Related Arrangements
(a) Supplier Rebates
We recorded adjustments to correct the misstatements found as a result of the internal investigation related to procurement described above. In connection
with the internal investigation, we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential
misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates, incentive payments, and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements,
which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. These misstatements were primarily
related to certain supplier contracts and related arrangements where the allocation of value of all or a portion of rebates and up-front payments to contractual
elements in the current period should have been deferred and recognized over an applicable contractual period. We corrected these misstatements to defer the
up-front consideration from suppliers when the retention or receipt of that consideration was contingent upon future events and to correctly recognize the
consideration as a reduction of cost of products sold over the terms of the arrangements with the suppliers. The impacts of the supplier rebate misstatements
on each period are discussed in restatement reference (a) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
(b) Capital Leases
As part of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements in connection with the internal investigation, we evaluated additional elements of such
arrangements, including the classification of embedded lease provisions as capital or operating. We had initially classified certain embedded lease provisions
as capital leases and allocated their fixed consideration to the lease components. As a result of our analysis, and also taking into consideration, among other
elements, the total value of supplier contracts and related arrangements, we determined that the classification of the embedded lease element for certain
contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition, we identified certain arrangements that were improperly
accounted for as embedded capital leases. The impacts of the capital lease misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (b) throughout
this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
Additional Misstatements
(c) Customer Incentive Program Expense Misclassifications
As previously disclosed in March 2018, we retrospectively corrected immaterial misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer
incentive program expense misclassifications. The impacts of the customer incentive program expense misclassifications on each period are discussed in
restatement reference (c) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
(d) Balance Sheet Misclassifications
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain balance sheet misclassifications in the correct period. These adjustments primarily related to the classification
of state income taxes, capital expenditures, and the classification of products held at co-packer locations. The impacts of the balance sheet misclassifications
on each period are discussed in restatement reference (d) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
(e) Income Taxes
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain income tax items in the correct period, primarily deferred tax adjustments related to a Brazilian subsidiary, as
well as return-to-provision adjustments and various other misclassifications. The income tax impacts of all misstatements outside of this category are included
in their respective misstatement categories. The impacts of income tax misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (e) throughout this
note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
(f) Impairments
We recorded an adjustment to recognize certain non-cash impairment losses in the correct period. In 2018, we had determined that a definite-lived intangible
asset had been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a license termination in that period and recorded an out-of-period correction to recognize the non-
cash impairment loss. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to correct goodwill impairment losses related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit,
which had been overstated. The impacts of the impairment misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (f) throughout this note and in
Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
68
(g) Other
We recorded adjustments to correct other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to
our consolidated financial statements. These other misstatements were primarily related to structured payable and product financing arrangements,
postemployment benefit plans, inventory write-offs, certain accrued liabilities, and other misstatements within net sales and certain income tax and balance
sheet accounts. The impacts of the other misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (g) throughout this note and in Note 23,
Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).
Description of Restatement Tables
The following tables represent our restated consolidated statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, statements of equity, and statements of
cash flows for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, as well as our restated consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017.
Following the restated consolidated financial statement tables, we have presented a reconciliation from our prior periods as previously reported to the restated
values. The values as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 30, 2017 filed on February 16, 2018.
In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of accounting standards
update (“ASU”) 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter
of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The
restated statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2017-07 and are labeled “As Recast.” See Note 4,
New Accounting Standards, for additional information related to our adoption of ASU 2017-07.

The $36 million decrease to net income was primarily driven by the misstatements in the other, supplier rebates, and impairments categories, partially offset
by the misstatements in the income taxes category. See additional descriptions of the net income impacts in the consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2016 section above.
The $7 million increase to foreign currency translation adjustments is primarily the result of misstatements in the balance sheet misclassifications and the
other misstatements categories, partially offset by misstatements in the income taxes category.
The $66 million decrease to prior service credits arising during the period and the $3 million increase to net postemployment benefit gains reclassified to net
income are the result of misstatements in the other category.

The $77 million decrease to additional paid-in capital was primarily driven by the misstatements in the income taxes, supplier rebates, and other categories,
which resulted in a decrease to net income for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, which has been reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital
rather than retained earnings due to certain dividends declared in 2015 without a corresponding amount in retained earnings.
The $55 million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive losses at January 3, 2016 was primarily driven by the misstatements in the other and income
taxes categories, partially offset by the misstatements in the balance sheet reclassifications category.

Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that
occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions
to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We
recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.
Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable
consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to
customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period
experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.
Advertising expenses are recorded in SG&A. For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales
activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. We recorded advertising
expenses of $584 million in 2018, $629 million in 2017, and $708 million in 2016, which represented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in
television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency
advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs were $1,140 million in 2018, $1,115 million in 2017, and
$1,221 million in 2016.
Research and Development Expense:
We expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $109 million in
2018, $93 million in 2017, and $120 million in 2016.
Stock-Based Compensation:
We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which is generally five years. These
costs are primarily recognized within SG&A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity
award compensation costs. We classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 12, Employees’ Stock
Incentive Plans, for additional information.
Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income), net in future periods using the corridor
approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 13, Postemployment Benefits, for
additional information.
82
Income Taxes:
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference
between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss
carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and
expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate
resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change.
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in
valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.
Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
capital.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash
equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage is classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the
consolidated balance sheets.
Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.
Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery
and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software
costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed
seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in
forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash
flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be
disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
83
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units, and our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We
test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained
decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to
regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural
disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, or significant adverse
changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its
carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the
case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
Financial Instruments:
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management
strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our
operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use
highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and
are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss), in the same line item as the underlying hedged
item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement
line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain
foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our
non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method, with changes reported in foreign currency translation
adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until
the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated
as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the
settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows
within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged
item, which is generally within operating activities.
84
To qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at
inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness, we
reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income within other expense/(income), net.
We formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between
the hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we
specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will
not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net income in the current period.
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within
general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized, the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note
14, Financial Instruments, for additional information.
Our designated and undesignated derivative contracts include:
•Net investment hedges. We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts,
foreign exchange contracts, and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-
currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness.
We recognize the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts in net income/(loss) within interest expense. We amortize the forward points on
foreign exchange contracts into net income/(loss) within interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship.
•Foreign currency cash flow hedges. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and
intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling, euro,
and Canadian dollar. These instruments include cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Substantially all
of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency
swap contracts and the forward points and option premiums or discounts on foreign exchange contracts from the assessment and measurement of
hedge effectiveness and amortize such amounts into net income/(loss) in the same line item as the underlying hedged item over the life of the
hedging relationship.
•Interest rate cash flow hedges. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk
management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future
debt obligations.
•Commodity derivatives. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw
materials. We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, sugar, vegetable oils, wheat
products, corn products, and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for
derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures, options, and
swaps to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including the commodities noted above, as well as packaging products, diesel
fuel, and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also occasionally use futures to economically cross
hedge a commodity exposure.
Translation of Foreign Currencies:
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on
the balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period.
85
Highly Inflationary Accounting:
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly
inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available
exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities
are reflected in net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no
longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We apply highly
inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela and Argentina. The net monetary assets of our subsidiary in Argentina were
approximately $2 million at December 29, 2018. See Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, for additional information related to our
subsidiary in Venezuela.
Note 4. New Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards Adopted in the Current Year
Presentation of Net Periodic Benefit Costs:
In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension
and postretirement cost). This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance, the service cost
component of net periodic benefit cost must be presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from
services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in
the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income/(loss) subtotal. Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for
capitalization in assets. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively for the statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net
periodic benefit cost components and prospectively for the capitalization of service cost components. There is a practical expedient that allows us to use
historical amounts disclosed in our Postemployment Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the statement of income presentation
requirements. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted this ASU using the practical expedient described above. There was no impact to our consolidated
balance sheet at December 30, 2017 or to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. See
Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for the impacts on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Revenue Recognition:
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, companies must apply a
five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified
retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients,
including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if the contract period is for one year or less. This ASU was effective
beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method and the practical
expedient described above. Upon adoption, we made the following policy elections: (i) we account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment
costs, and (ii) we exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g., sales, use, and value added taxes) from the
transaction price. The impact of adopting this guidance was immaterial to our financial statements and related disclosures.
Income Tax Impacts of Certain Intercompany Transfers:
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax accounting impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as
intellectual property and property, plant and equipment. Under the new accounting guidance, current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon
transfer of the assets. Previously, recognition of current and deferred income taxes was prohibited until the asset was sold to an external party. This ASU
became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this new guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-
effect adjustment of $95 million to decrease retained earnings in the first quarter of 2018.
86
Definition of a Business Clarification:
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 clarifying the definition of a business used in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU provides a screen for companies to determine if an integrated set of assets and activities (“set”) is
not a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of
similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. If this screen is not met, the entity then determines if the set meets the minimum requirement of a business.
For a set to be a business, it must include an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. This ASU
became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this ASU on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not impact
our financial statements or related disclosures.
Goodwill Impairment Test Simplification:
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the entity will record an impairment loss based on that difference. The
impairment loss will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Previously, if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its
carrying amount (Step 1), an entity was required to calculate any impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount
(Step 2). Additionally, under the new standard, companies that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to
perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, reporting units with zero or negative
carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however, additional disclosure will be required of those companies. We
early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis as of April 1, 2018 (our annual impairment testing date in the second quarter of 2018). As a result of
adopting this ASU, we no longer perform Step 2 while completing our goodwill impairment testing, beginning with our annual goodwill impairment testing
in the second quarter of 2018.
Accounting for Hedging Activities:
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance impacted the accounting for financial (e.g., foreign
exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (e.g., commodity) hedging activities. We early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis in the
third quarter of 2018. Upon adoption, we recognized an insignificant cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit). The most significant impacts
of adoption are that we now:
•Recognize changes in the fair value of excluded components in net income/(loss) in the current period or in other comprehensive income/(loss) (and
then amortize into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship);
•Defer changes in the spot rate of the hedging instrument into other comprehensive income/(loss), while the excluded component (i.e., forward points
or option premiums or discounts) is amortized into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship. When the excluded component is
released or the forecasted transaction occurs, it is recognized in the same income statement line item affected by the hedged item; and
•Present additional details in our tabular disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements.
Additionally, ASU 2017-12 eliminated the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; therefore, we removed disclosures related to
hedge ineffectiveness. See our consolidated statements of other comprehensive income, Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, Note 14, Financial
Instruments, and Note 15, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses), for updated disclosures pursuant to ASU 2017-12.
87
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
Leases:
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of
financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. The updated guidance requires lessees to reflect the
majority of leases on their balance sheets as assets and obligations. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early
adoption is permitted. The guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method. The ASU also provides for certain practical
expedients. Among the practical expedients is an optional transition method that allows companies to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) on the adoption date. We plan to elect this practical expedient upon adoption. We also plan to elect
the package of practical expedients that will allow us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists, the classification of a lease, and whether
initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard. We do not expect to use the hindsight practical expedient. We do plan to elect the
land easement option, which will allow us to continue to use prior accounting conclusions reached in our accounting for land easements. We also plan to elect
the short-term lease exemption whereby we will not record an asset or liability for short-term leases. We have completed our scoping reviews, identified our
significant leases by geography and by asset type, and developed our accounting policies and expected policy elections, which will take effect upon adoption
of the standard. We have executed our lease data extraction strategy and completed data extraction efforts. Our identified accounting system, which will
support the future state leasing process, is also ready for implementation. We have completed our future state process design as part of the overall system
implementation. Upon adoption, we expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements.
We expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that, upon adoption, we will have total lease assets
between approximately $750 million and $910 million and total lease liabilities between approximately $810 million and $990 million. We will adopt this
ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019.
Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses:
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 to update the methodology used to measure current expected credit losses (“CECL”). This ASU applies to
financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and trade accounts receivable as well
as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as loan commitments. This ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a
methodology to reflect CECL and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates. The
guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period
of adoption. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the
impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption.
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017. U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to
21.0%. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be
presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However, the related tax effects of such deferred tax assets and liabilities may have been originally
recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional, and if elected, may be applied either to the period of adoption or
retrospectively to the period(s) impacted by U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, this ASU requires companies to disclose the policy election for stranded tax
effects as well as the general accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). This ASU will be
effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019 and
will make the policy election to reclassify stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). We
currently estimate the increase to retained earnings/(deficit) upon adoption will be between approximately $130 million and $140 million.
88
Fair Value Measurement Disclosures:
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of
and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred, and valuation processes
for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value
measurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing
requirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, including the amount and location of
unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in
determining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance
in whole is permitted. Alternatively, companies may early adopt removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their
effective date. Certain of the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively upon adoption, while other amendments must be applied retrospectively
upon adoption. We elected to early adopt the provisions related to removing disclosures in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018 on a retrospective basis.
Accordingly, we have removed information related to our valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements for pension plan investments within Note 13,
Postemployment Benefits. We also removed information about the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy from
Note 14, Financial Instruments. There was no other impact to our financial statement disclosures as a result of early adopting the provisions related to
removing disclosures. We are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of the provisions related to modifying and adding disclosures as well as the timing of
adoption.
Disclosure Requirements for Certain Employer-Sponsored Benefit Plans:
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 related to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures, including weighted-average interest rates used in
the company’s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period.
Additionally, this guidance eliminates certain previous disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year
2020. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact this
ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption.
Implementation Costs Incurred in Hosted Cloud Computing Service Arrangements:
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements.
Under the new guidance, implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the
nature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization, they must be amortized
over the term of the hosting arrangement and assessed for impairment. Companies must disclose the nature of any hosted cloud computing service
arrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of
cash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted,
including in an interim period. This guidance may be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of
adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption and
the application method.
Note 5. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Cerebos Acquisition
On March 9, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Cerebos Pacific Limited (“Cerebos”) (the “Cerebos
Acquisition”), an Australian food and beverage company with several local brands in Australia and New Zealand. The Cerebos business manufactures,
markets, and sells food and beverage products, including gravies, sauces, instant coffee, salt, herbs and spices, and tea. Cerebos is included in our
consolidated financial statements as of the Acquisition Date. We have not included unaudited pro forma results, prepared in accordance with ASC 805, as if
Cerebos had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, as it would not yield significantly different results.
The Cerebos Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The total consideration paid for Cerebos
was $244 million. We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such allocation was final as of December 29, 2018.
89
The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cerebos Acquisition was (in millions):
Cash $ 23
Other current assets 65
Property, plant and equipment, net 75
Identifiable intangible assets 100
Trade and other payables (41)
Other non-current liabilities (3)
Net assets acquired 219
Goodwill on acquisition 25
Total consideration $ 244
The Cerebos Acquisition resulted in $25 million of non tax deductible goodwill relating principally to planned expansion of Cerebos brands into new
categories and markets. This goodwill was allocated to Rest of World as shown in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The final purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Cerebos Acquisition was:
 Fair Value
(in millions of
dollars)  Weighted Average
Life
(in years)
Definite-lived trademarks $ 87 22
Customer-related assets 13 12
Total $ 100  
We valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant
assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales,
cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk
inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the
assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category
growth rates, management plans, and market comparables.
We used carrying values as of the Acquisition Date to value trade receivables and payables, as well as certain other current and non-current assets and
liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at the Acquisition Date.
We valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach. Raw materials and packaging inventory was valued using the
replacement cost approach.
We valued property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income approach, the market approach, and the cost approach, which is based on the
current replacement and/or reproduction cost of the asset as new, less depreciation attributable to physical, functional, and economic factors.
We incurred deal costs of $18 million in 2018 related to the Cerebos Acquisition.
Other Acquisitions
In the third quarter of 2018, we had two additional acquisitions of businesses, including The Ethical Bean Coffee Company Ltd., a Canadian-based coffee
roaster, and Wellio, Inc., a full-service meal planning and preparation technology start-up in the U.S. The aggregate consideration paid related to these
acquisitions was $27 million.
In November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in Primal Nutrition, LLC
(“Primal Nutrition”) for approximately $200 million (the “Primal Acquisition”). Primal Nutrition is a better-for-you brand primarily focused on condiments,
sauces, and dressings, with growing product lines in healthy snacks and other categories. The brand holds leading positions in the e-commerce and natural
channels. The Primal Acquisition closed on January 3, 2019.
We incurred aggregate deal costs related to other acquisitions of $2 million in 2018.
90
Divestitures
In May 2018, we sold our 50.1% interest in our South African subsidiary to our minority interest partner. The transaction included proceeds of $18 million,
which are included in other investing activities, net on the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2018. We recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of business of
approximately $15 million. The pre-tax loss was included in SG&A on the consolidated statement of income for 2018.
In October 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Zydus Wellness Limited and Cadila Healthcare Limited (collectively, the “Buyers”) to
sell 100% of our equity interests in Heinz India Private Limited (“Heinz India”) for approximately 46 billion Indian rupees (approximately $660 million at
December 29, 2018) (the “Heinz India Transaction”). In connection with the Heinz India Transaction, we will transfer to the Buyers, among other assets and
operations, our global intellectual property rights to several brands, including Complan, Glucon-D, Nycil, and Sampriti. Our core brands (i.e., Heinz and
Kraft) will not be transferred. The Heinz India Transaction closed on January 30, 2019. We expect to recognize a gain on this transaction upon closing. We
have presented the assets and liabilities related to the Heinz India Transaction as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018. This
divestiture is not considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, it will not be reported as
discontinued operations.
We entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the Heinz India Transaction.
Additionally, we entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges related to our investment in Heinz India.
See Note 14, Financial Instruments, for additional information. We also recorded changes in our deferred tax liabilities related to the Heinz India Transaction.
See Note 11, Income Taxes, for additional information.
Additionally, in November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Parmalat SpA (“Parmalat”) to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio
in Canada for approximately 1.6 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $1.2 billion at December 29, 2018) (the “Canada Natural Cheese Transaction”). In
connection with the Canada Natural Cheese Transaction, we will transfer certain assets to Parmalat, including the intellectual property rights to Cracker
Barrel in Canada and P’Tit Quebec globally. While this transaction is contingent on customary closing conditions, we expect the Canada Natural Cheese
Transaction to be finalized in mid-2019. We expect to recognize a gain on this transaction upon closing. We have presented the assets and liabilities related to
the Canada Natural Cheese Transaction as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018. This divestiture is not considered a strategic
shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, it will not be reported as discontinued operations.
Our assets and liabilities held for sale, by major class, were (in millions):

Note 6. Integration and Restructuring Expenses
As part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee
benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity
award compensation expense, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur
expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S.
GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment
charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, costs to exit facilities, and
costs associated with restructuring benefit plans.
Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements,
or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of
severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee’s required future service period. Charges
for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case
depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held
for disposal or sale, and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as
incurred.
Integration Program:
At the end of 2017, we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the “Integration Program”), which was
designed to reduce costs and integrate and optimize our combined organization, primarily in the U.S. and Canada segments. Overall, as part of the Integration
Program, we closed net six factories, consolidated our distribution network, and eliminated 4,900 positions. Approximately 65% of total Integration Program
costs were reflected in cost of products sold, and approximately 60% were cash expenditures.
As of December 29, 2018, we had incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of $2,146 million, including $92 million in 2018, $316 million in 2017, and $887 million
in 2016. The $2,146 million of cumulative pre-tax costs included $541 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $889 million of non-cash asset-
related costs, $609 million of other implementation costs, and $107 million of other exit costs. The related amounts incurred in 2018 were $2 million of
severance and employee benefit costs, $32 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $59 million of other implementation costs, and $1 million of credits in
other exit costs.
Our cumulative pre-tax costs related to the Integration Program, as well as the associated costs for the year ended December 30, 2017, reflect the restatements
described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 29, 2018, we do not expect to incur significant additional expenses related to the Integration Program.
Our liability balance for Integration Program costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs) was (in millions):
 Severance and
Employee Benefit

Non-cash utilization (9) (19) (28)
Balance at December 29, 2018 $ 5 $ — $ 5
(a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations.
The Integration Program liability at December 29, 2018 relates to the elimination of salaried positions in Canada. We expect the majority of this liability to be
paid by the end of 2019.
92
Restructuring Activities:
In addition to our Integration Program in North America, we have other restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on workforce reduction,
factory closure and consolidation, and benefit plan restructuring. Related to these programs, we expect to eliminate approximately 1,900 positions, 1,400 of
which were eliminated in 2018. These programs resulted in expenses of $368 million in 2018, including $48 million of severance and employee benefit costs,
$63 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $251 million of other implementation costs, and $6 million of other exit costs. Other implementation costs
included a non-cash settlement charge related to the settlement of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans in 2018. See Note
13, Postemployment Benefit Plans, for additional information. Other restructuring program expenses totaled $118 million in 2017 and $125 million in 2016.
Our liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs) was (in millions):

Balance at December 29, 2018 $ 32 $ 33 $ 65
(a) Other exit costs primarily consist of lease and contract terminations.
We expect the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 29, 2018 to be paid by the end of 2019. The liability for other exit costs
primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2019 and
2026.

Balance at December 29, 2018 $ 29,597 $ 2,438 $ 3,074 $ 1,394 $ 36,503
Goodwill at December 30, 2017 reflects the restatements described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the first quarter of 2018, we reorganized our segment structure to move our Middle East and Africa businesses from the Rest of World segment to the
EMEA reportable segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. Accordingly, the segment goodwill balances at December 30,
2017 reflect an increase of $179 million in EMEA and a corresponding decrease in Rest of World. This change did not have a material impact on our current
or any prior period results. See Note 22, Segment Reporting, for additional information.
See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to our acquisitions in 2018, as well as assets held for sale at December 29, 2018
related to the Canada Natural Cheese Transaction and the Heinz India Transaction.
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying amount of $36.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. We test our reporting
units for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We performed our 2018 annual impairment test as of April 1, 2018. We utilized the discounted
cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a
non-cash impairment loss of $133 million in SG&A related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit within our Rest of World segment primarily due
to anticipated and sustained margin declines in the region. The goodwill carrying amount of this reporting unit was $509 million prior to its impairment.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units were below their carrying amounts. Although
our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.
95
While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of seven of our 20 reporting units, including U.S. Grocery, U.S. Refrigerated, Canada Retail,
Australia and New Zealand, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Other Latin America, were below their carrying amounts. These factors included: (i) a
sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the
completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs
and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018, which provided additional insights into
expectations and priorities for the coming years, such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November 2018 to sell certain
assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada, which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit;
(v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase in the United States in
December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as of the end of December
2018.
As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these seven reporting units were below their carrying amounts, we performed an
interim impairment test on these reporting units as of December 29, 2018. After assessing the totality of circumstances, we determined that each of the
remaining 13 reporting units was unlikely to have a fair value below carrying amount.
As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $6.9 billion in SG&A related to five reporting units, including U.S. Refrigerated,
Canada Retail, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and Other Latin America. The other two reporting units we tested were determined to not be impaired. We
utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Drivers of these impairment losses, by
reporting unit, were as follows:
•We recognized a $4.1 billion impairment loss in our U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit within our United States segment due to revised 2019 base and
future year margin expectations, primarily in the natural cheese and meats categories, and, to a lesser extent, expectations for lower long-term net
sales growth in the natural and processed cheese categories. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases
in supply chain costs, expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning, and expectations for increased marketing investments,
primarily in response to private label competition, as well as customer-driven packaging investments. Changes in expectations for lower long-term
net sales growth were primarily due to sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations
were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual
operating plan in December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan,
which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The goodwill carrying amount of the U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit
was $11.3 billion prior to its impairment.
•We recognized a $1.9 billion impairment loss in our Canada Retail reporting unit within our Canada segment due to lower positive net sales growth
expectations and revised 2019 base and future year margin expectations, as well as the reassessment of our Canadian operations following the
announcement in November to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada. We revised our net sales growth expectations primarily
due to our expected exit of the natural cheese category and expected declines in the coffee category (exclusive of our coffee business acquisition in
Canada in 2018). Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s
expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily
driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs and expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning. The goodwill carrying
amount of the Canada Retail reporting unit was $4.0 billion prior to its impairment.
•We recognized a $315 million impairment loss in our Southeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales
declines in the seafood and seasonal cordials categories and foreign exchange rate declines in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Our revised
expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our
2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. This impairment represents all of the goodwill of the Southeast Asia reporting unit.
•We recognized a $302 million impairment loss in our Northeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales
declines as well as foreign exchange rate declines in Japan and Korea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter
results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. The goodwill
carrying amount of the Northeast Asia reporting unit was $391 million prior to its impairment.
96
•We recognized a $207 million impairment loss in our Other Latin America reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to net sales and
margin declines in the region. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s
expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. This impairment represents all of the goodwill of the Other
Latin America reporting unit.
The goodwill carrying amounts associated with an additional four reporting units, which each had excess fair value over its carrying amount of 20% or less,
were $18.5 billion for U.S. Grocery, $424 million for Latin America Exports, $404 million for Southeast Europe, and $367 million for Australia and New
Zealand as of December 29, 2018.
Accumulated impairment losses to goodwill were $7.0 billion at December 29, 2018.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and
regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and
other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates,
change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the development of our global five-year operating plan, then one
or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. Our reporting units that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair
values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, these and other individual
reporting units that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any
assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Reporting units with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: U.S. Grocery, U.S. Refrigerated, Canada Retail, Latin America Exports, Southeast
Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Northeast Asia. Of the $29.0 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $9.3 billion is attributable to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Although the remaining reporting units have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying
amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are
recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future,
these amounts are also susceptible to impairments.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets:
Changes in the carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions):
Balance at December 30, 2017 $ 53,655
Impairment losses (8,925)
Reclassified to assets held for sale (341)
Transfers to definite-lived intangible assets (72)
Translation adjustments (351)
Balance at December 29, 2018 $ 43,966
Indefinite-lived intangible assets reclassified to assets held for sale included the Cracker Barrel trademark in Canada and Complan and Glucon-D trademarks
in India. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information on assets held for sale at December 29, 2018 related to the Canada Natural
Cheese Transaction and the Heinz India Transaction.
Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $44.0 billion as
of December 29, 2018. We test our brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than its carrying amount. We performed our 2018 annual impairment test as of April 1,
2018. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $101 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2018. This
impairment loss was due to net sales and margin declines related to the Quero brand in Brazil, which was valued using the relief from royalty method. The
impairment loss was recorded in our Rest of World segment, consistent with the ownership of the trademark.
In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $215 million in SG&A related to the Smart Ones brand, which was valued using
the relief from royalty method. This impairment loss was primarily due to reduced future investment expectations and continued sales declines in the third
quarter of 2018. The impairment loss was recorded in our United States segment, consistent with the ownership of the trademark. We transferred the
remaining carrying amount of Smart Ones to definite-lived intangible assets due to a shift in future investments to other brands in the frozen and chilled foods
category.
97
For the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any brands were below their carrying amounts. Although our
annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.
While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of six of our brands, including Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Cool Whip, and
ABC, were below their carrying amounts. These factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. As
we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these six brands were below their carrying amounts, we performed an interim
impairment test on these brands as of December 29, 2018. After assessing the totality of circumstances, we determined that each of the remaining brands was
unlikely to have a fair value below its carrying amount.
As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $8.6 billion in SG&A related to five brands, including three that were valued
using the excess earnings method (Kraft, Oscar Mayer, and Philadelphia) and two that were valued using the relief from royalty method (Velveeta and ABC).
The other brand we tested was determined to not be impaired. The impairment losses for Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, and Velveeta were recorded in our
United States segment, and the ABC impairment loss was recorded in our Rest of World segment, consistent with the ownership of each trademark. Drivers of
these impairment losses, by brand, were as follows:
•We recognized a $4.3 billion impairment loss related to the Kraft brand, primarily due to lower long-term net sales growth expectations in the natural
cheese category in the United States, lower net sales growth expectations in the processed cheese category in the United States and Canada, and the
exit of the natural cheese category in Canada announced in November 2018. Changes in expectations for lower net sales growth were primarily due
to distribution losses driven by sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations were
based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual
operating plan in December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan,
which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Kraft brand was $15.9 billion prior to its
impairment.
•We recognized a $3.3 billion impairment loss related to the Oscar Mayer brand, primarily due to revised 2019 annual and future margin expectations
in the United States. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs, expectations for
lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning, and expectations for increased marketing investments and customer-driven packaging
investments. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and
the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our
global five-year operating plan, which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Oscar
Mayer brand was $6.6 billion prior to its impairment.
•We recognized a $797 million impairment loss related to the Philadelphia brand, primarily due to revised 2019 annual and future margin
expectations, and to a lesser extent, lower future positive net sales growth expectations in the United States. Changes in future year margin
expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs and expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive
positioning, as well as unfavorable changes in product mix and customer-driven packaging investments. Our revised expectations were based on the
completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in
December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan, which commenced in
November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Philadelphia brand was $6.7 billion prior to its impairment.
•We recognized a $168 million impairment loss related to the Velveeta brand, primarily due to expectations for lower long-term net sales growth due
to anticipated trends in consumer preferences. The carrying amount of the Velveeta brand was $2.5 billion prior to its impairment.
•We recognized an $84 million impairment loss related to the ABC brand, primarily due to revised expectations of future net sales growth and margins
in the seafood and seasonal cordials categories in Southeast Asia as well as foreign exchange rates in the regions in which this brand is sold. The
carrying amount of the ABC brand was $357 million prior to its impairment.
The aggregate carrying amount associated with an additional six brands (Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip, Stove Top, and Quero), which each had
excess fair value over its carrying amount of 20% or less, was $5.8 billion as of December 29, 2018.
98
As a result of our 2017 annual impairment testing, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $49 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2017. This
loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our EMEA segment as the related trademark is owned by an
Italian subsidiary.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory
conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty
rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of
our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the development of our global
five-year operating plan, then one or more of our brands might become impaired in the future. Our brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to
their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, these and
other individual brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future
impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Brands with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate
carrying amount of $29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip,
Stove Top, ABC, and Quero. Of the $29.3 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $24.0 billion is attributable to brands with 0% excess fair value
over carrying amount. Although the remaining brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing
date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to
impairments.

Definite-lived intangible asset balances at December 30, 2017 reflect the restatements described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $290 million in 2018, $278 million in 2017, and $267 million in 2016. Aside from amortization
expense, the changes in definite-lived intangible assets from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018 primarily reflect the reclassification to assets held for
sale of $96 million, additions of $100 million related to purchase accounting for Cerebos, transfers of $72 million from indefinite-lived intangible assets,
impairment losses of $3 million, and foreign currency. The impairment of definite-lived intangible assets in 2018 related to a trademark which had a carrying
amount that was deemed not to be recoverable. This non-cash impairment loss was recognized in SG&A. Definite-lived intangible assets reclassified to assets
held for sale included customer-related assets in Canada and India and certain trademarks, including P’Tit Quebec in Canada. See Note 5, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerebos in 2018, as well as our assets held for sale at December 29, 2018.
We estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $284 million in 2019 and approximately $274 million
in each of the four fiscal years thereafter.
Note 11. Income Taxes
U.S. Tax Reform:
On December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform legislation was enacted by the federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax laws by, among
other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed
repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there were many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation,
revised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax
(“BEAT”), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018, we
accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.
99
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the SEC in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax
Reform and allowed for provisional estimates when actual amounts could not be determined. As of December 30, 2017, we had made estimates of our
deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change, the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
including depreciation and executive compensation, and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we reassessed
our international investment assertion and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 to be indefinitely
reinvested. We made an estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. Additionally, we elected to
account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus did not adjust any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax
Reform.
Our initial accounting for U.S. Tax Reform as of December 30, 2017 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including an estimate of our
deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by an estimate of $312 million for
the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Related to our indefinite
reinvestment assertion change, we had recorded an estimate of deferred tax liabilities of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings as of
December 30, 2017.
In the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a measurement period adjustment to reduce income tax expense and reduce deferred tax liabilities each by
approximately $20 million. We also recorded insignificant measurement period adjustments in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2018.
As of December 29, 2018, we had finalized our accounting for U.S. Tax Reform. The final impact (the majority of which was recorded in 2017, the period of
enactment) was a net tax benefit of approximately $7.1 billion, including a deferred tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate
change, partially offset by tax expense of $224 million related to the toll charge and $120 million for other tax expenses, including the deferred tax liability
recorded for changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion change, we had a deferred tax liability of $111
million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings as of December 30, 2017.
Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $33 million as of December 29, 2018 to reflect our investment in an Indian subsidiary that is no longer
considered to be indefinitely reinvested. At the same time, we reversed $28 million of deferred tax liabilities related to local withholding tax obligations. As
of December 29, 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2 billion of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will
be owed when this cash is distributed.
We consider the unremitted current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely
reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately
$20 million.

Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments recorded directly to additional paid-in capital totaled $30 million in 2016. In
the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively adopted ASU 2016-09. We now record tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity
instruments within our tax provision, rather than within equity. Accordingly, we recognized a tax benefit in our statements of income of $12 million in 2018
and $22 million in 2017 related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments.
Effective Tax Rate:
The effective tax rate on income/(loss) before income taxes differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the following reasons:
   As Restated

Effective tax rate 9.4 % (100.6)% 27.0 %
101
The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly,
the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation of
the percentage point impact of U.S. Tax Reform, tax exempt income, and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by
income/(loss) before income taxes. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world could impact comparability of
reconciling items between periods. Additionally, small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law or a change in tax rates that causes us to revalue our
deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate.
The 2018 effective tax rate was lower, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate, non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments,
nonmonetary currency devaluation losses, and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans), the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our
deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform, which were partially offset by the benefit from intangible asset impairment
losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information related to our impairment losses in the fourth
quarter of 2018.
The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017. The related income tax benefit of 129.0% in 2017
primarily reflects adjustments to our deferred tax positions for the lower federal income tax rate, partially offset by our provision for the one-time toll charge.
The tax provision for the 2016 tax year included a benefit related to the tax effect of statutory tax rate changes, including a benefit related to the impact on
deferred taxes of a 10-basis-point reduction in the state tax rate and a 100-basis-point statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom.
Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities:

At December 29, 2018, deferred income tax liabilities excluded amounts classified as held for sale. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional
information.
The decrease in deferred tax liabilities from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018 was primarily driven by intangible asset impairment losses recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.
At December 29, 2018, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $307 million. Of that amount, $26 million expire between 2019 and 2038; the other $281
million do not expire. We have recorded $86 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets of $90
million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2019 and 2038.
Uncertain Tax Positions:
At December 29, 2018, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $387 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact on
our effective tax rate would have been $352 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $54 million in
the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions
are included in income taxes payable and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Reclassified to liabilities held for sale (10) — —
Balance at the end of the period $ 387 $ 408 $ 389
Our unrecognized tax benefits decreased during 2018 mainly as a result of audit settlements with federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities and statute of
limitations expirations. Our unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2017 as a result of evaluating tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our
federal, state, and foreign income tax returns.
In 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all Kraft open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 through 2014. This settlement
reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions and resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $42 million.
We include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $5 million
expense in 2018, $24 million benefit in 2017, and $8 million expense in 2016 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $62 million
as of December 29, 2018 and $57 million as of December 30, 2017.
Other Income Tax Matters:
In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia,
Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of December 29, 2018, we have substantially concluded all national income
tax matters through 2016 for the Netherlands, through 2014 for the United States, through 2012 for the United Kingdom, through 2011 for Australia, Canada,
and Italy. We have substantially concluded all state income tax matters through 2007. Additionally, as of April 2019, we had substantially concluded all
national income tax matters through 2015 for the United States.
We have a tax sharing agreement with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz International”), which generally provides that (i) we are liable for U.S. state
income taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012 and (ii) Mondelēz International is responsible for
U.S. federal income taxes and substantially all non-U.S. income taxes, excluding Canadian income taxes, for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012.
Kraft's U.S. operations were included in Mondelēz International's U.S. federal consolidated income tax returns for tax periods through October 1, 2012. In
December 2016, Mondelēz International reached a final resolution on a U.S. federal income tax audit of the 2010-2012 tax years. As noted above, we are
indemnified for U.S. federal income taxes related to these periods.
Note 12. Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans
We grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”), to select employees to provide long-
term performance incentives to our employees. As a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently
eligible to use Form S-8 registration statements.
Stock Plans
We had activity related to equity awards from the following plans in 2018, 2017, and 2016:
2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In April 2016, our Board of Directors approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2016 Omnibus Plan”), which authorized grants of options, stock
appreciation rights, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. This plan authorizes the
issuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan generally have a five-year cliff vest period,
and non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan since inception include non-
qualified stock options, RSUs, and PSUs.
103
2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
Prior to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Plan, we issued non-qualified stock options to select employees under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2013
Omnibus Plan”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following
this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. Non-qualified stock options awarded under
the 2013 Omnibus Plan have a five-year cliff vest period and a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These non-qualified stock options will continue to vest
and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2013 Omnibus Plan and the relevant award agreements.
Kraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan:
Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the
2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option
adjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft Heinz RSU. These Kraft Heinz equity awards will continue to vest and
become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger. These options
generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have a maximum exercise term of
10 years. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan,
vesting generally accelerates for holders of Kraft awards who are terminated without cause within two years of the 2015 Merger Date.
In addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance-based, long-term incentive awards (“Performance Shares”), which vested based on varying
performance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Performance Shares were converted into cash awards,
payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii)
the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without
cause.
Stock Options
We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. Our weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:
 December 29,
2018  December 30,
2017  December 31,
2016
Risk-free interest rate 2.75% 2.25% 1.63%
Expected term 7.5 years 7.5 years 7.5 years
Expected volatility 21.3% 19.6% 22.0%
Expected dividend yield 3.6% 2.8% 3.1%
Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 10.26 $ 14.24 $ 12.48
The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date, with a remaining term equal to the expected life of
the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data, we calculated
expected life using the Safe Harbor method, which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2018, we estimated
volatility using a blended volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. In 2017
and 2016, we estimated volatility using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. We calculated peer volatility as the average of the term-
matched, leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co., The Coca-Cola Company, Mondelēz International, Altria Group, Inc., PepsiCo,
Inc., and Unilever plc. We estimated the expected dividend yield using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and
continuously compounded.

Restricted Stock Units
RSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the plan and the applicable award agreement.
We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs are not dividend-eligible. We discounted the fair value
of these RSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price,
annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs granted during the year was $58.59 in 2018, $91.25 in 2017, and $77.53 in 2016. Our
expected dividend yield was 3.31% in 2018. All RSUs granted in 2017 and 2016 were dividend-eligible.

The aggregate fair value of RSUs that vested during the period was $9 million in 2018, $12 million in 2017, and $40 million in 2016.
Performance Share Units
PSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the plan and the applicable award agreement
and are subject to achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our PSUs. None of our PSUs are dividend-eligible; therefore, we discounted the fair
value of our PSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price,
annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of PSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We adjust the expense based on
the likelihood of future achievement of performance metrics.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our PSUs granted during the year was $56.31 in 2018 and $79.85 in 2017. Our expected dividend
yield was 3.31% in 2018 and 2.73% in 2017. There were no PSUs granted in 2016.

Note 13. Postemployment Benefits
As noted above, as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8
registration statements. As a result, on April 23, 2019, the administrator of the Kraft Heinz Savings Plan and the Kraft Heinz Union Savings Plan
(collectively, the “Plan”) issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during which participants are prohibited from acquiring
beneficial ownership of additional interests in The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund. If we are not able to become and remain current in our reporting
requirements with the SEC, it restricts our ability to maintain The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund or issue other equity securities to our employees.
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic
union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with
the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union
hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations.
We provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and
Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement benefits
of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment.
We remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.
We capitalize a portion of net pension and postretirement cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities. Beginning January 1, 2018, only the
service cost component of net pension and postretirement cost/(benefit) is capitalized into inventory. As part of the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the first
quarter of 2018, we recognized a one-time favorable credit of $42 million within cost of products sold related to amounts that were previously capitalized into
inventory. Included in this credit was $28 million related to prior service credits that were previously capitalized to inventory.
Pension Plans
In 2018, we settled our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, which resulted in settlement charges of $162 million for the
year ended December 29, 2018. Additionally, the settlement of these plans impacted the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, fair
value of plan assets, and service costs associated with our non-U.S. pension plans.
We had approved the wind-up of the Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans in 2016, and the wind-up was effective on
December 31, 2016. This action resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligations of approximately $85 million at December 31, 2016. This action
had no impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $4.1 billion at December 29, 2018 and $4.7 billion at
December 30, 2017 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $1.7 billion at December 29, 2018 and
$3.3 billion at December 30, 2017.
The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in net pension assets of $918 million at December 29, 2018 and $758 million at December 30, 2017.
We recognized these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):

Discount rates for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that
match the expected future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' historical long-term
investment performance, target asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

Plan Assets:
The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit
obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security
of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements
specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long
term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash
flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for
the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides
guidelines enabling the applicable plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.
Our weighted average asset allocations were:
 U.S. Plans  Non-U.S. Plans
 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017
Fixed-income securities 84% 62% 45% 39%

Real estate —% —% 3% 6%
Certain insurance contracts —% —% 2% 24%
Total 100% 100% 100% 100%
Our pension investment strategy for U.S. plans is designed to align our pension assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an
investment of approximately 85% of our U.S. plan assets in fixed-income securities and approximately 15% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity
securities.
For pension plans outside the United States, our investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each
individual country. In aggregate, the long-term asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 65% fixed-
income securities and annuity contracts, and approximately 35% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities and real estate.
The fair value of pension plan assets at December 29, 2018 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions):

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the
fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.
Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally
corporate bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other
observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2.
Government Bonds. These securities consist of direct investments in publicly traded U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally debentures). Such
investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are included in Level 1.
Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing
price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based on
cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified as
Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2.
Real Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments and are generally classified as Level 3.
Certain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members and have
been classified as Level 3.
Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments and partnership/corporate feeder interests.
•Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the
collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The
fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed
on each business day based upon the applicable net asset value per unit. Investments in the international large/mid cap equity collective trust can be
redeemed on the last business day of each month and at least one business day during the month.
The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange, and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income
manager. The fair values of these investments are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of
actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset
value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable risk, where performance is
expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the investment manager.
110
•Short-term investments. Short-term investments largely consist of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported
by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net
asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive
yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level
of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.
•Partnership/corporate feeder interests. Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of the
partnership. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the equity
partnership may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner.
The investment objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities.
The fair values of the corporate feeder are based upon the net asset values of the equity master fund in which it invests. The fair value of these
investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with at
least 90 days’ notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities with
attractive fundamentals.

Employer Contributions:
In 2018, we contributed $57 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We did not contribute to our U.S. pension plans. We estimate that 2019 pension
contributions will be approximately $15 million to our non-U.S. plans. We do not plan to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2019. Our actual
contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility,
significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.

accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were (in millions):
 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017
Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,294 $ 1,553
Fair value of plan assets 1,044 1,188
We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations:
 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017
Discount rate 4.2% 3.5%
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.7% 6.7%
Ultimate trend rate 4.9% 4.9%
Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going
forward.
The year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2019 and 2030 as of December 29, 2018.
112
Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 29, 2018 (in millions):

Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) — — (1)
Curtailments — (177) —
Net postretirement cost/(benefit) $ (308) $ (446) $ (292)
The amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by plan amendments in 2015 and 2016. We estimate that amortization of prior service credits
will be approximately $306 million in 2019, $122 million in 2020, $8 million in 2021, $6 million in 2022, and $6 million in 2023.
In 2017, we remeasured certain of our postretirement plans and recognized a curtailment gain of $177 million. The curtailment was triggered by the number
of cumulative headcount reductions after the closure of certain U.S. factories during the year. The resulting gain is attributed to accelerating a portion of the
previously deferred actuarial gains and prior service credits. The headcount reductions and factory closures were part of our Integration Program. See Note 6,
Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information.
We used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net postretirement benefit plans cost:
 December 29,
2018  December 30,
2017  December 31,

Discount rate - Service cost 3.6% 4.0% 4.3%
Discount rate - Interest cost 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 4.4% —% —%
Health care cost trend rate 6.7% 6.3% 6.5%
Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' target asset allocation and estimates of future
long-term returns by asset class. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going
forward.
Plan Assets:
In December 2017, we made a cash contribution of approximately $1.2 billion to pre-fund a portion of our U.S. postretirement plan benefits following
enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our U.S. postretirement plans is to ensure that funds
are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they are due by investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the
security of the funds. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-
income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash flow requirements.

 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017
Fixed-income securities 65% —%
Equity securities 27% —%
Cash and cash equivalents 8% 100%
Our postretirement benefit plan investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our
investment strategy is designed to align our postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate, our
long-term asset allocation targets are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 70% in fixed-income securities and approximately 30% in return-
seeking assets, primarily equity securities.
The fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets at December 29, 2018 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions):

The fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets was $1.2 billion at December 30, 2017. These assets were all classified as Level 1 short-term
investments.
The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets, including an indication of
the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.
Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally

investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are included in Level 1.
Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing
price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.
Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds and short-term investments.

on each business day based upon the applicable net asset value per unit. Investments in the international large/mid cap equity collective trust can be
redeemed on the last business day of each month and at least one business day during the month.
The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange. The fair values of the mutual fund investments that are not traded on an exchange are based
on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close

In 2018, we contributed $19 million to our postretirement benefit plans. We estimate that 2019 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be
approximately $15 million. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws
and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.
Future Benefit Payments:
Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement plans at December 29, 2018 were (in millions):
2019 $ 131
2020 127
2021 120
2022 114
2023 107
2024-2028 440
Other Plans
We sponsor and contribute to employee savings plans that cover eligible salaried, non-union, and union employees. Our contributions and costs are
determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $85
million in 2018, $78 million in 2017, and $74 million in 2016.

losses/(gains) into net pension or net postretirement benefit plan costs/(benefits) during 2019.
Note 14. Financial Instruments
All of our non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement, and these master
agreements and their schedules contain certain obligations regarding the delivery of certain financial information upon demand.
Derivative Volume:
The notional values of our outstanding derivative instruments were (in millions):
 Notional Amount
 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017
Commodity contracts $ 478 $ 272
Foreign exchange contracts 3,263 2,876
Cross-currency contracts 10,146 3,161
The increase in our derivative volume for cross-currency contracts was primarily driven by the addition of new Canadian dollar and British pound sterling
cross-currency swaps. A portion of these new contracts is being used to offset existing cross-currency contracts that are no longer designated as hedging
instruments. The remaining portion of the new contracts is designated as net investment hedges.
116
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments:
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy of derivative instruments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
were (in millions):

(c)The fair value of derivative assets was recorded in other current assets and the fair value of derivative liabilities was recorded in other current liabilities.
Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early
termination of the contract. We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. If the
derivative financial instruments had been netted on the consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $124
million at December 29, 2018 and $23 million at December 30, 2017. At December 29, 2018, collateral of $32 million was posted related to commodity
derivative margin requirements. This was included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018.
Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities.
117
Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity swaps, foreign exchange forwards, options, and swaps, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity
swaps are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
Foreign exchange forwards and swaps are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the
notional amount. Foreign exchange options are valued using an income approach based on a Black-Scholes-Merton formula. This formula uses present value
techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on observable market rates. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot
and swap rates.
We did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities in any period presented.
Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.
Net Investment Hedging:
At December 29, 2018, we had the following items designated as net investment hedges:
•Non-derivative foreign denominated debt with principal amounts of €2,550 million and £400 million;
•Cross-currency contracts with notional amounts of £1.0 billion ($1.4 billion), C$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion), and ¥9.6 billion ($85 million); and
•Foreign exchange contracts, including contracts denominated in:
◦Chinese renminbi with an aggregate notional amount of $127 million,
◦Euros with an aggregate notional amount of $264 million, and
◦Indian rupees with an aggregate notional amount of $279 million.
The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are
economically offset by fair value movements on the effective portion of our cross-currency contracts and foreign exchange contracts and remeasurements of
our foreign denominated debt.
Interest Rate Hedging:
From time to time we have had derivatives designated as interest rate hedges, including interest rate swaps. We no longer have any outstanding interest rate
swaps. We continue to amortize the realized hedge losses that were deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) into interest expense
through the original maturity of the related long-term debt instruments.
Cash Flow Hedge Coverage:
At December 29, 2018, we had entered into foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next 12 months and into
cross-currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next five years.
Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses on Cash Flow Hedges:
Based on our valuation at December 29, 2018 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss)
of unrealized gains for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be approximately $32 million. Additionally, we expect transfers to net
income/(loss) of unrealized losses for interest rate cash flow hedges and cross-currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant.
Concentration of Credit Risk:
Counterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit
ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses
due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our
counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses.
Economic Hedging:
We enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy which have an economic
impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of cost
of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income), net for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts.
118
Divestiture Hedging:
We entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the Heinz India Transaction. The
related derivative losses were $20 million, including $17 million recorded within other expense/(income), net, and $3 million recorded within interest expense
for the year ended December 29, 2018. These losses are classified as other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures. Additionally, we entered into
foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges related to our investment in Heinz India. Related to these net investment hedges,
we had unrealized hedge losses of $10 million, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). See Note 5, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, for additional information related to the Heinz India Transaction.

Note 16. Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation
We have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products, primarily in the condiments and sauces and infant and nutrition
categories. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial
statements. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency of Kraft
Heinz), although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result, we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S.
dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average DICOM (as defined below) rates, and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary
assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income/(loss), rather than
accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). These gains and losses are classified within other expense/(income), net as nonmonetary currency
devaluation on our consolidated statements of income.
In February 2018, the Venezuelan government eliminated the official exchange rate, which was available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida (“DIPRO”)
for purchases and sales of certain essential items, including food products. At December 30, 2017, we had outstanding invoice reimbursement requests of $26
million related to the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015. Following the elimination of this preferential rate, we
determined that these outstanding requests, which were approved by the Venezuelan government, were no longer collectible. There was no impact on our
consolidated statements of income for 2018.
123
Following elimination of the DIPRO rate, the Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (“DICOM”) is the only foreign currency exchange mechanism legally
available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars. As of December 29, 2018, we believe the DICOM rate is the most appropriate legally
available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to monitor the DICOM rate, and the nonmonetary assets supported
by the underlying operations in Venezuela, for impairment.
The auction-based DICOM system was temporarily frozen in September 2017 and reopened in February 2018. The last published DICOM rate before the
auction freeze was BsF3,345 per U.S. dollar compared to BsF25,000 per U.S. dollar upon reopening. In August 2018, the Venezuelan government changed
the unit for measuring bolivars from the bolivar fuerte (“BsF”) to the bolivar soberano (“BsS”). The conversion ratio is BsF100,000 to BsS1. Upon converting
to the bolivar soberano measurement unit, the Venezuelan government further devalued the currency. On August 20, 2018, the published DICOM rate was
BsF6,000,000 (BsS60.00) per U.S. dollar compared to approximately BsF249,000 (BsS2.49) per U.S. dollar immediately preceding the conversion to BsS.
The DICOM rate at December 29, 2018 was BsS638.18 per U.S. dollar compared to BsS0.03 at December 30, 2017. We remeasured the bolivar denominated
assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at December 29, 2018 using the DICOM spot rate of BsS638.18 per U.S. dollar. We remeasured the income
statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary using a weighted average rate of BsS25.06 in 2018, BsS0.02 in 2017, and BsS0.01 in 2016. Remeasurements of the
monetary assets and liabilities and operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary at DICOM rates resulted in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses of
$146 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017, and $24 million in 2016. These losses were recorded in other expense/(income), net in the consolidated statements
of income.
Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, resulting in a $53 million loss
to write down property, plant and equipment, net, and prepaid spare parts, which was recorded within cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of
income in 2016.
We did not obtain any U.S. dollars at DICOM rates during 2018. In addition to DICOM, there is an unofficial market for obtaining U.S. dollars with
Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is widely debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published DICOM rate. We
have not transacted at any unofficial market rates and have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future.
Our Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through exports and royalty payments. These U.S. dollars are primarily used for purchases of tomato paste
and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 29, 2018, our Venezuelan subsidiary has sufficient
U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However, further deterioration of the economic environment or regulation changes
could jeopardize our export business. Our Venezuelan subsidiary has increasingly sourced production inputs locally, including tomato paste and sugar, in
order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.
Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to control our
operations. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving government controls over imports, prices, currency exchange, and
payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic
environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. We
currently do not expect to make any new investments or contributions into Venezuela.
Note 17. Financing Arrangements
We have utilized accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the “Programs”) globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient
liquidity. During 2018, we had Programs in place in various countries across the globe. In the second quarter of 2018, we unwound our U.S. securitization
program, which represented the majority of our Programs, using proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in June 2018. As of December 29, 2018, we
have unwound all of our Programs.
We operated the Programs such that we generally utilized the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We accounted for transfers of
receivables pursuant to the Programs as a sale and removed them from our consolidated balance sheets. Under the Programs, we generally received cash
consideration up to a certain limit and recorded a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintained a “beneficial
interest,” or a right to collect cash, in the sold receivables. Cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying
trade receivables that have already been securitized in these Programs) are classified as investing activities and presented as cash receipts on sold receivables
on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
124
The carrying value of trade receivables removed from our consolidated balance sheets in connection with the Programs was $1.0 billion at December 30,
2017. In exchange for the sale of trade receivables, we received cash of $673 million at December 30, 2017 and recorded sold receivables of $353
million at December 30, 2017. There were no such balances at December 29, 2018. The carrying value of sold receivables approximated the fair value at
December 30, 2017.
We acted as servicer for certain of the Programs. We did not record any related servicing assets or liabilities as of December 30, 2017 because they were not
material to the financial statements.
Our U.S. securitization program utilized a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity (“SPE”). The SPE was wholly-owned by a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz,
and its sole business consisted of the purchase or acceptance, through capital contributions, of receivables and related assets from a Kraft Heinz subsidiary
and the subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank. Although the SPE is included in our consolidated financial statements, it was a
separate legal entity with separate creditors who were entitled, upon its liquidation in the second quarter of 2018, to be satisfied out of the SPE's assets prior
to any assets or value in the SPE becoming available to Kraft Heinz or its subsidiaries.
Additionally, we enter into various structured payable and product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification
is based on the nature of the agreements. For certain arrangements, we classify amounts outstanding within other current liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheets. We had approximately $267 million on our consolidated balance sheets at December 29, 2018 and approximately $268 million at
December 30, 2017 related to these arrangements.
Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections, or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of
our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we do
not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.
Class Actions and Stockholder Derivative Actions:
We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in three securities class action lawsuits filed in February, March, and
April 2019. The first filed action, Hedick v. The Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on February 24, 2019 against the Company and three of its officers (the
“Hedick Action”). The second filed action, Iron Workers District Council (Philadelphia and Vicinity) Retirement and Pension Plan v. The Kraft Heinz
Company, was filed on March 15, 2019 against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former officers (the “Iron Workers Action”). The third
filed action, Timber Hill LLC v. The Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on April 25, 2019 against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former
officers and one of its directors (the “Timber Hill Action”). All of these securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois. Another securities class action lawsuit, Walling v. Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on February 26, 2019 in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former officers (the “Walling Action”).
Plaintiff in the Walling Action filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of his complaint, without prejudice, on April 26, 2019.
Plaintiffs in these lawsuits purport to represent a class of all individuals and entities who purchased, sold, or otherwise acquired or disposed of publicly traded
securities of the Company (including in the Timber Hill Action, the purchase of call options on Company common stock, the sale of put options on Company
common stock, and the purchase of futures on the Company’s common stock) from May 4, 2017 through February 21, 2019, in the case of the Hedick Action
and the Walling Action, and from July 6, 2015 through February 21, 2019, in the case of the Iron Workers Action and the Timber Hill Action. The complaints
assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases, investor presentations, earnings
calls, and SEC filings regarding the Company’s business, financial results, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount,
attorneys’ fees and other relief.
125
In addition, our Employee Benefits Administration Board and certain of our current and former employees are currently defendants in one class action
lawsuit, Osborne v. Employee Benefits Administration Board of Kraft Heinz, which was filed on March 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit purport to represent a class of current and former employees who were participants in and
beneficiaries of various retirement plans which were co-invested in a commingled investment fund known as the Kraft Foods Savings Plan Master Trust (the
“Master Trust”) during the period of May 4, 2017 through February 21, 2019.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 502 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) based on alleged breaches of obligations as fiduciaries subject to ERISA by allowing the Master Trust to continue investing
in our common stock. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys’ fees, and other relief.
Certain of our current and former officers and directors, among others, are also currently defendants in five stockholder derivative actions: DeFabiis v. Hees
filed on April 16, 2019, Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Hees filed on May 8, 2019, Kailas v. Hees filed on May 13, 2019, Silverman v. Behring filed on
May 15, 2019, and Green v. Behring filed on May 23, 2019, with the Company named as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffs, derivatively on behalf of the
Company, assert claims under the common law and statutory law of Delaware for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties as well as alleged violations of Sections
10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in
public statements and SEC filings. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecific amount, attorneys’ fees, and other relief. All of these stockholder derivative
actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, due to the early stage of
these proceedings.
Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation:
As previously disclosed on February 21, 2019, we received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC related to our procurement area, specifically the
accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and
changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with external counsel and forensic
accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters.
Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019, when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible
asset impairments, the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting, internal controls, and disclosures, our assessment of goodwill
and intangible asset impairments, and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern District of Illinois also is reviewing this matter, working with the SEC and receiving materials from it. We cannot predict the eventual scope,
duration or outcome of any potential SEC legal action or other action or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flow. We have been responsive to the ongoing subpoenas and other document requests and will continue to cooperate fully with any
governmental or regulatory inquiries or investigations.
Other Commitments and Contingencies
As a result of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements, we determined that the classification of the embedded lease element for certain
contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition, we identified certain arrangements that were improperly
accounted for as embedded capital leases. Therefore, future obligations associated with operating leases and purchase obligations have been restated below.
See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to the restatement and our review of
supplier contracts and related arrangements.
Leases:
Rental expenses for leases of warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment were $200 million in 2018, $244 million in 2017, and $198 million
in 2016.
Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 29, 2018 were (in millions):
2019 $ 185
2020 137
2021 105
2022 70
2023 49
Thereafter 148
Total $ 694
126
Purchase Obligations:
We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected
needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures,
information technology, and professional services.
As of December 29, 2018, our take-or-pay purchase obligations were as follows (in millions):
2019 $ 1,569
2020 757
2021 405
2022 287
2023 210
Thereafter 217
Total $ 3,445
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest:
In 2017, we commenced operations of a joint venture with a minority partner to manufacture, package, market, and distribute refrigerated soups and meal
sides. We control operations and include this business in our consolidated results. Our minority partner has put options that, if it chooses to exercise, would
require us to purchase portions of its equity interest at a future date. These put options will become exercisable beginning in 2025 (on the eighth anniversary
of the product launch date) at a price to be determined at that time based upon an independent third party valuation. The minority partner’s put options are
reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. We accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to its estimated
redemption value over the term of the put options. At December 29, 2018, we estimate the redemption value to be approximately $35 million.
Note 19. Debt
Borrowing Arrangements:
On July 6, 2015, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company (“KHFC”), our 100% owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a credit agreement (as
amended, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). In June 2018,
we entered into an agreement that became effective on July 6, 2018 to extend the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 6, 2021 to July 6, 2023
and to establish a $400 million euro equivalent swing line facility, which is available under the $4.0 billion revolving credit facility limit for short-term loans
denominated in euros on a same-day basis.
No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 29, 2018, at December 30, 2017, or during the years ended December 29, 2018,
December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.
The Senior Credit Facility includes a $1.0 billion sub-limit for borrowings in alternative currencies (i.e., euro, sterling, Canadian dollars, or other lawful
currencies readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. dollars), as well as a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $300 million. Subject to
certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up
to $1.0 billion.
Any committed borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR/EURIBOR/CDOR loans or an alternate
base rate/Canadian prime rate, in each case subject to an applicable margin based upon the long-term senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt rating
assigned to us. The borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility have interest rates based on, at our election, base rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, CDOR, or
Canadian prime rate plus a spread ranging from 87.5 to 175 basis points for LIBOR, EURIBOR, and CDOR loans, and 0 to 75 basis points for base rate or
Canadian prime rate loans.
The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could upon the occurrence of
certain events of default restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. Our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum shareholders’
equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $35 billion. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the
year ended December 29, 2018.
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.
127
However, as previously disclosed, on March 22, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the “Original Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit
Facility, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by
us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Pursuant
to the Original Waiver, we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14, 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial
reporting, on May 10, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the “Second Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility, pursuant to which
the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us
with respect to the requirements to furnish the lenders copies of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and for the
fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019. Pursuant to the Second Waiver and in order to remedy our noncompliance, we are required to provide consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than
July 31, 2019. If we had not obtained these waivers, we would not have been able to access our Senior Credit Facility.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by KHFC in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and by Kraft
Heinz in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and KHFC.
In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”).
Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 29, 2018 or December 30, 2017.
We obtain funding through our U.S. and European commercial paper programs. At December 29, 2018, we had no commercial paper outstanding. At
December 30, 2017, we had commercial paper outstanding of $448 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%.

(g)The 6.250% Pound Sterling Senior Secured Notes due February 18, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) were issued by H.J. Heinz Finance UK Plc. Kraft Heinz and KHFC fully and unconditionally
guarantee the 2030 Notes. This guarantee is secured and senior in right of payment of existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness. Kraft Heinz became guarantor of the 2030
Notes in connection with the 2015 Merger. The 2030 Notes were previously only guaranteed by KHFC.
128
Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the year
ended December 29, 2018.
During the period from December 29, 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the delays in the preparation of our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, we were not in compliance with certain reporting
covenants under certain indentures. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.
Under our existing indentures, if we do not file required reports within specified time periods, the trustee or holders of at least 30% in the case of our Second
Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and 25% in the case of any other series of notes may deliver a notice of default for such series of notes which would
commence the applicable cure period under such indenture. As of June 5, 2019, none of the cure periods under our existing indentures have been triggered in
connection with our failure to comply with the respective reporting covenants set forth in such indentures. However, if a cure period is triggered under such
indentures and we fail to file our annual and interim financial statements within such cure period, any outstanding notes issued thereunder would become
callable.
At December 29, 2018, our long-term debt excluded amounts classified as held for sale. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information.
At December 29, 2018, aggregate principal maturities of our long-term debt excluding capital leases were (in millions):
2019 $ 355
2020 2,992
2021 990
2022 3,508
2023 2,460
Thereafter 20,329
Debt Issuances:
In June 2018, KHFC, our 100% owned operating subsidiary, issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2021, $1.6 billion
aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2023, and $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2029 (collectively, the
“New Notes”). The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kraft Heinz as to payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior
unsecured basis.
We used approximately $500 million of the proceeds from the New Notes in connection with the wind-down of our U.S. securitization program in the second
quarter of 2018. We also used proceeds from the New Notes to refinance a portion of our commercial paper borrowings in the second quarter of 2018, to
repay certain notes that matured in July and August 2018, and for other general corporate purposes.
In August 2017, KHFC issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019, $650 million aggregate principal amount of
floating rate senior notes due 2021, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022 (collectively, the “2017 Notes”). The
2017 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kraft Heinz as to payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior unsecured basis.
We used the net proceeds from the 2017 Notes primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our $600 million Term Loan Facility together with accrued
interest thereon, to refinance a portion of our commercial paper programs, and for other general corporate purposes.
In May 2016, KHFC issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior notes due June 2026, $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.375%
senior notes due June 2046, €550 million aggregate principal amount of 1.500% senior notes due May 2024, and €1,250 million aggregate principal amount
of 2.250% senior notes due May 2028 (collectively, the “2016 Notes”). The 2016 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kraft Heinz as to
payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior unsecured basis.
We used the net proceeds from the 2016 Notes primarily to redeem all outstanding shares of our 9.00% cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A
(“Series A Preferred Stock”) for $8.3 billion. See Note 20, Capital Stock, for additional information.
129
Debt Issuance Costs:
Debt issuance costs are reflected as a direct deduction of our long-term debt balance on the consolidated balance sheets. We incurred debt issuance costs of
$15 million in 2018 and $53 million in 2016. Debt issuance costs in 2017 were insignificant. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $115 million at
December 29, 2018, $114 million at December 30, 2017, and $124 million at December 31, 2016. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $16 million in
2018, $16 million in 2017, and $14 million in 2016.
Debt Premium:
Unamortized debt premiums are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct addition to the carrying amount of debt. Unamortized debt premium,
net, was $430 million at December 29, 2018 and $505 million at December 30, 2017. Amortization of our debt premium, net, was $65 million in 2018, $81
million in 2017, and $88 million in 2016.
Debt Repayments:
In July and August 2018, we repaid $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. We funded these long-term debt
repayments primarily with proceeds from the New Notes issued in June 2018.
Additionally, in June 2017, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. We funded these long-term debt
repayments primarily with cash on hand and our commercial paper programs.
Fair Value of Debt:
At December 29, 2018, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $30.1 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.2 billion. At December 30, 2017,
the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.0 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.5 billion. Our short-term debt and commercial paper had
carrying values that approximated their fair values at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. We determined the fair value of our long-term debt using
Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Note 20. Capital Stock
Preferred Stock
Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 920,000 shares of preferred stock.
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all 80,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for $8.3 billion. We funded this redemption primarily through
the issuance of long-term debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our U.S. commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program,
and cash on hand. In connection with the redemption, all Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and automatically retired.
Common Stock
Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5.0 billion shares of common stock.
Shares of common stock issued, in treasury, and outstanding were (in millions of shares):

Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, including dilutive effect 1,219 1,228 1,226
Net earnings/(loss) $ (8.36) $ 8.91 $ 2.78
Basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 reflect the restatements that impacted net income/(loss) attributable to
common shareholders. The restatements had no impact on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding or dilutive equity awards in prior periods.
See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards in the denominator for diluted EPS. We had net losses
attributable to common shareholders in 2018. Therefore, we have excluded the dilutive effects of equity awards in 2018 as their inclusion would have had an
anti-dilutive effect on EPS. Anti-dilutive shares were 13 million in 2018, 2 million in 2017, and 3 million in 2016.
Note 22. Segment Reporting
Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and
depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts
of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general
corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses,
gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency
devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Segment
Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain
items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources.
Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.

Restatement of Previously Issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
We have restated herein our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each interim period within the nine months ended
September 29, 2018 and the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.
The following tables represent our restated unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each quarter-to-date and year-to-date interim period
within the nine months ended September 29, 2018 and the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 and at each interim period therein. The 2018 quarterly
restatements will be effective with the filing of our future 2019 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement filings in Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q.
The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018 were derived from our Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q filed on November 2, 2018, August 3, 2018, and May 3, 2018, respectively. The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarter
ended December 30, 2017 were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017 filed on February 16, 2018. The values
as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 were derived from our Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q, as amended for the first and second quarters, all of which were filed on November 7, 2017. See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated
Financial Statements, for a description of the misstatements in each category of restatements referenced by (a) through (g).
In addition, the condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within the year ended December 30, 2017, as previously reported, did
not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was
adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic
benefit cost components. Our condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within fiscal year 2017 have been recast accordingly. See
Note 4, New Accounting Standards, for additional information related to our adoption of ASU 2017-07.

Note 24. Supplemental Guarantor Information
Restatement of Previously Issued Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements
We have restated herein our previously issued condensed consolidating financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Following the restated condensed
consolidating financial statement tables, we have presented our condensed consolidating financial statements as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and
2016, which were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 filed on February 16, 2018. See Note 2,
Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information, including a description of the misstatements.
In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to
the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 29, 2018. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 29, 2018, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;
•provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 based on the framework described in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 due to the material weaknesses
described below.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of
misstatement due to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiencies described
below, which we also determined to be material weaknesses:
•Supplier Contracts and Related Arrangements: We did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and
related arrangements. Specifically, certain employees in our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that
included withholding information or directing others to withhold information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain
supplier rebates, incentives, and pricing arrangements, in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were
perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. Additionally, in certain instances, we did not
have a sufficient understanding or maintain sufficient documentation of the transaction to determine the appropriate accounting for certain cost and
rebate elements and embedded leases. This material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
215
•Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing: We did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of
precision used to review the impairment assessments related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as changes in our business
environment occurred. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used in the review of the
allocation of cash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in
response to the significant reduction in, and in certain instances elimination of, the excess fair value over carrying amount of certain brands that
resulted from changes in our business environment. This material weakness did not result in a misstatement of any previously issued consolidated
financial statements.
Additionally, the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result
in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, as stated in their report
which appears herein under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Remediation of Material Weaknesses
We are evaluating the material weaknesses and developing a plan of remediation to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component
of internal control over financial reporting, supplier contracts and related arrangements, and the level of precision applied to the goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible asset impairment testing process. The remediation efforts summarized below, which are in the process of being implemented, are intended to
address the identified material weaknesses and enhance our overall internal control environment.
•Personnel Actions—A comprehensive disciplinary plan is in the process of being implemented for all employees found to have engaged in
misconduct, including termination, written warnings, and appropriate training depending on the severity of the misconduct.
•Performance Targets—We have identified and will be implementing several performance-based target enhancements as follows: (i) implementing
checkpoints to evaluate significant changes in the environment that could adversely impact the attainability of management goals and targets; (ii)
reassessing and adjusting the overall balance of performance measures provided to employees to help drive challenging but attainable targets; and
(iii) enhancing our training and overall communication specific to the Management by Objective (“MBO”) process, including a focus on the process
to request relief from previously established MBOs, to help ensure all eligible employees are aware of and understand the overall MBO waiver and
relief process; (iv) reinforcing the importance of adherence to established internal controls and company policies and procedures through other
formal communications, town hall meetings, and other employee trainings; and (v) reassessing certain employees’ key performance indicators.
•Organizational Enhancements—We have identified and are in the process of implementing organizational enhancements as follows: (i) augmenting
our procurement finance teams with additional professionals with the appropriate levels of accounting and controls knowledge, experience, and
training in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; and (ii) realigning reporting lines whereby procurement finance now report
directly to the finance organization.
•Procurement Practices—We have evaluated our procurement practices and are in the process of implementing improvements to those practices,
including: (i) developing more comprehensive contract approval policies and processes; (ii) enhancing required communication protocols among all
functions involved in the procurement process (e.g., procurement, legal, accounting, and finance) to ensure all relevant parties are involved in the
contract review process; (iii) standardizing contract documentation and analyses; and (iv) developing a more comprehensive accounting review
process and monitoring controls over supplier contracts and related arrangements to ensure transactions are recorded in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
•Training Practices—We are in the process of developing a comprehensive global procurement training program that will cover supplier contracts and
related arrangements, including potential accounting implications. As part of this effort, we have held mandatory training for our global procurement
function, which focused on our policies and procedures related to procurement, including the proper accounting for the contract terms that
contributed to the material weakness.
•Procurement Management Software—We have started to evaluate potential solutions to implement or upgrade the existing procurement management
software to enhance the identification, tracking, and monitoring of supplier contracts and related arrangements.
•Level of Precision Applied to Impairment Testing—We are in the process of implementing a plan to enhance the level of precision at which our
internal controls over financial reporting relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments are performed.
Specifically, we will be implementing and executing additional procedures to (i)
216
enhance our analysis of forecasted cash flows used in the impairment assessment and (ii) test the accuracy of forecasted cash flow allocations to
specific brands.
We believe the measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial
reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and have begun to implement some of the steps described above. We will
also continue to review, optimize, and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal
control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or we may modify certain of the remediation measures
described above. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 29, 2018. We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the three months ended December 29, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Guidelines articulate our governance philosophy, practices, and policies in a range of areas, including: the Board’s role and responsibilities; the
composition and structure of the Board; the establishment and responsibilities of the committees of the Board; executive and director performance
evaluations; and succession planning. The Governance Committee reviews the Guidelines annually and recommends any changes to the Board.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors and Code of Conduct for Employees
We have a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors (the “Directors Ethics Code”) that is designed to deter wrongdoing and
to promote:
•honest and ethical conduct;
•due care, diligence, and loyalty;
•confidentiality of our proprietary information;
•compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including insider trading compliance; and
•accountability for adherence to the Directors Ethics Code and prompt internal reporting of violations.
220
Annually, each non-employee director acknowledges in writing that he or she has received, reviewed, and understands the Directors Ethics Code.
We also have a written Code of Conduct for employees (the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct includes a set of employee policies that cover ethical
and legal practices for nearly every aspect of our business. The Code of Conduct reflects our values and contains important rules our employees must follow
when conducting business to promote compliance and integrity. The Code of Conduct is part of our global compliance and integrity program that provides
support and training throughout our Company and encourages reporting of wrongdoing by offering anonymous reporting options and a non-retaliation policy.
We will disclose in the Corporate Governance section of our Web site (described below) any amendments to our Directors Ethics Code or Code of Conduct
and any waiver granted to an executive officer or director under these codes.
Corporate Governance Materials Available on Our Web Site
Our Web site contains the Guidelines, our Board committee charters, the Code of Conduct, and the Directors Ethics Code. To view these documents, go to
http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com and click on “Corporate Governance.” We will promptly deliver free of charge, upon request, a copy of the Guidelines, the
Board committee charters, the Code of Conduct, or the Directors Ethics Code to any stockholder requesting a copy. Requests should be directed to our
Corporate Secretary at The Kraft Heinz Company, 200 East Randolph Street, Suite 7600, Chicago, IL 60601.
The information on our Web site is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our
other filings with the SEC.
Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock (collectively, the
“Reporting Persons”), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments
thereto filed electronically with the SEC by the Reporting Persons with respect to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, we believe that all filing
requirements were complied with in a timely manner, except in two instances where Form 4s were inadvertently filed late on behalf of two directors to report
certain transactions as follows: (i) in April 2018, to report three purchases of shares that were executed by the broker of one of our former directors, Mackey
McDonald, on Mr. McDonald’s behalf without his knowledge or direction; and (ii) in June 2019, to report one transaction relating to the transfer of certain
shares held in a trust for the benefit of Mr. Pope’s three adult children as a result of their election to exercise control over such shares in accordance with the
terms of the trust that held these shares.
BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board established the Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee consists
entirely of independent directors, and each director meets the independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of Nasdaq, Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act and the Audit Committee charter. The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member is able to read and understand fundamental
financial statements. In addition, the Board has determined that Ms. Jackson and Mr. Pope are “audit committee financial experts” within the meaning of SEC
regulations. No Audit Committee member received any payments in 2018 from us other than compensation for service as a director.
BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY COMMITTEE
Effective June 5, 2019, the Board established the Operations and Strategy Committee to assist it in overseeing and facilitating the development and
implementation of our ongoing operations and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is led by John Cahill, Vice Chairman of the Board,
and meets with management regularly to discuss, review and evaluate the development and implementation of our operational objectives and corporate
strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is comprised of five directors appointed by the Board, based on nominations recommended to the Board by
our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Based on its review, the committee shares with management the Board’s expectations for the
operations of the company and strategic planning process, makes recommendations to management on areas of improvement, and provides other feedback
and guidance to management on behalf of the Board. The Operations and Strategy Committee’s responsibilities also include, among others, reviewing and
making recommendations to the Board regarding:
•our corporate strategy, performance, and annual capital plan, as well as certain individual capital projects;
•the impact of external developments and factors, such as any changes in economic and market conditions, competition in the industry, environmental
and safety regulations, federal, state and local regulations and technology, on our corporate strategy and its execution;
•identification of prospects and opportunities for corporate developments and growth initiatives, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures
and strategic alliances; and
221
•implementation of our corporate strategy through corporate developments and growth initiatives, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures
and strategic alliances.
Item 11. Executive Compensation.
BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The Board has determined that all of the directors who served on the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 are independent within the meaning of
the Nasdaq listing standards. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current, or during fiscal year 2018 was, a former, officer, or employee of
Heinz, Kraft, Kraft Heinz, or any of their subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship that must be
described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of “related person transactions” (for a description of our policy on “related person transactions,” see
“Independence and Related Person Transactions” in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence). During fiscal year
2018, none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers
serving on the Board or the Compensation Committee.
Analysis of Risk in the Compensation Architecture
Annually, the Compensation Committee evaluates the risk profile of our executive and broad-based employee compensation programs. In its evaluation for
fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed our executive compensation structure as well as our overarching compensation systems to determine
whether our compensation policies and practices encourage our executive officers or other employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks and whether
these policies and practices properly mitigate risk. In addition, Willis Towers Watson advised management with respect to the risk assessment of our
Performance Bonus Plan.
As described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” our compensation structure is designed to incentivize executives and employees to achieve
Kraft Heinz financial and strategic goals as well as individual performance goals that promote long-term stockholder returns. However, certain employees
within our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that included withholding information or directing others to withhold
information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain supplier rebates, incentives, and pricing arrangements, in an attempt to
influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our
business environment. We are undertaking various remedial efforts outlined in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, and expect to revise the Performance
Bonus Plan for 2019 to explicitly state applicable penalties such as score and/or percentage reductions and losses, up to and including ineligibility for and
forfeiture of payments under the Performance Bonus Plan for misconduct. We also expect to revise the Performance Bonus Plan for 2019 to require that if the
aforementioned misconduct is discovered after the payout under the Performance Bonus Plan, we would be entitled to seek equitable relief to recoup the
amounts paid, including without limitation disgorgement, in addition to any other remedies under the law.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation programs on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation
Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In reliance
on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compensation Committee:
Alexandre Behring, Chair
Jorge Paulo Lemann

COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
Following the 2015 Merger, the Board approved our non-employee director compensation program, which was designed to be similar to the program in place
at Kraft prior to the 2015 Merger. The table below summarizes the annual cash and equity compensation elements in place for our non-employee directors.
Compensation Element(1)  Fee
($)
Board Retainer  110,000
Chairman Retainer  250,000
Audit Committee Chair Retainer  20,000
Compensation Committee Chair Retainer  20,000
Governance Committee Chair Retainer  10,000
Operations and Strategy Committee Chair Retainer(2) 20,000
Stock Grant Value(3) 125,000
(1)If a director serves as Chair of multiple committees, he or she receives fees for only one committee. Therefore, Mr. Behring does not receive a retainer for service as Chair of the Governance
Committee.
(2)Effective June 5, 2019, the Board established the Operations and Strategy Committee to assist it in overseeing and facilitating the development and implementation of our ongoing operations
and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is led by John Cahill, Vice Chairman of the Board.
(3)Non-employee directors are awarded Kraft Heinz deferred shares. Although the deferred shares are vested as of the award date, the shares are not distributed until six months following the date
the non-employee director ceases to serve on our Board. When dividends are paid on our common stock, we accrue the value of the dividend paid and issue shares equal to the accrued value six
months after the director’s departure.
Non-employee directors receive an annual stock award that is granted effective immediately following our annual meeting of stockholders. We also pay the
non-employee directors cash retainers on a quarterly basis. Non-employee directors also have the option to (i) defer up to 100% of their cash retainers in 25%
increments into accounts that mirror certain funds in the Kraft Heinz 401(k) Plan pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors
or (ii) receive deferred shares annually in lieu of their cash retainer payable in arrears.
Our stock ownership guidelines require non-employee directors who elect to receive compensation for service as directors to hold shares of our common
stock in an amount equal to five times the annual Board retainer (equivalent to $550,000) within five years. As all of our current directors have served
following the 2015 Merger for less than five years, they are not yet required to meet the stock ownership requirement. We feel strongly that our director
compensation program significantly aligns our non-employee directors’ and stockholders’ interests.
For as long as Mr. Zoghbi continues to serve as a Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, it is anticipated that he will not receive compensation for his services as a
director. For a discussion of Mr. Zoghbi’s compensation arrangement, please see “Compensation Arrangement” in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence.
The table below presents information regarding the compensation and stock awards that we have paid or granted to our non-employee directors.

 Marcel Herrmann Telles  22,166
(4)Mr. Cahill provides advisory and consulting services to Kraft Heinz related to current and historical finances, relationships with licensors, customers, and vendors, employee matters, product
development, marketing and distribution, government affairs, and strategic opportunities. These services are provided pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into between Mr. Cahill and the
Company in November 2017. Previously, these services were provided pursuant to an arrangement entered into following the 2015 Merger. Mr. Cahill’s services under the consulting agreement
are distinct and separate from his duties as a director. Payments to Mr. Cahill under the consulting agreement are disclosed in the “All Other Compensation” column. For a discussion of the
advisory and consulting services provided by Mr. Cahill to Kraft Heinz, please see “Consulting Agreement” in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which we refer to as the “CD&A”, outlines the compensation philosophy and objectives of Kraft Heinz and
describes our executive pay programs for fiscal year 2018 and, specifically, for the following Named Executive Officers (also referred to as “NEOs”):
Name  Title
Bernardo Hees  Chief Executive Officer
David Knopf  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Paulo Basilio  Zone President of U.S.
Rafael Oliveira  Zone President of EMEA
Rashida La Lande  Senior Vice President, Global General Counsel and Head of CSR and Government Affairs; Corporate Secretary
Executive Summary
The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) oversees our executive compensation plans and programs. Our programs are designed to complement each
other to provide a clear link between what we pay our NEOs and Kraft Heinz’s performance over both short- and long-term periods. The overall program has
been designed to accomplish each of the following goals:
•Rewarding superior financial and operational performance;
•Placing a significant portion of compensation at risk if performance goals are not achieved;
•Aligning the interests of the NEOs with those of our stockholders; and
•Enabling us to attract, retain, and motivate top talent.
Consistent with these goals and as described in further detail below, our compensation program has been designed with a view toward linking a significant
portion of each NEO’s compensation to Company and individual performance and the growth in the value of Kraft Heinz.
224
Elements of Compensation Program
As noted above, our compensation program is based on a pay-for-performance philosophy. This section of the CD&A provides an overview of each element
of our compensation program and describes both the process for determining such compensation and how such compensation relates to Kraft Heinz’s pay-for-
performance philosophy and meritocratic principles. The following table summarizes the primary elements and objectives of our 2018 compensation program
for executive officers, including our NEOs.
Element  Description  Primary Objectives
Base Salary
 Ongoing cash compensation based on the executive officer’s role and
responsibilities, individual job performance, and experience.  • Recruitment and retention
Annual Cash Incentive
(Performance Bonus
Plan)
 Annual incentive with target award amounts for each executive officer. Actual
cash payouts are linked to achievement of annual Company goals and individual
performance. For fiscal year 2018, payouts could range from 0%-130% of target
depending on the relevant metric.  • Drive top-tier performance
• Incentivize and reward
Stock Options
 Stock option awards that cliff vest after five years.
 • Drive top-tier performance
• Align with stockholders’ interests
• Link realized value entirely to stock price
appreciation
• Retention
Restricted Stock Units
(“RSUs”)
 RSUs that cliff vest after five years may be awarded pursuant to our annual
Bonus Swap Program or individual agreements or separate grants with
additional conditions.  • Drive top-tier performance
• Align with stockholders’ interests
• Retention
Performance Share
Units (“PSUs”)
 Awards that are linked to achievement of multi-year profitability goals. The
PSUs pay out in Kraft Heinz common stock after five years, depending on the
achievement of the performance objectives and subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions.  • Drive top-tier performance
• Align with stockholders’ interests
• Long-term value creation
• Retention
Base Salary
Base salary is the principal “fixed” element of executive compensation at Kraft Heinz and for our NEOs. The Committee believes that it is important that
each NEO receive a competitive marketplace base salary to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation. The initial base salary
of each NEO is established in connection with the hiring of such NEO. In establishing base salaries, Kraft Heinz reviews market-based survey data published
by the Hay Group and select country-specific surveys, in each case, for informational purposes only. We do not formally benchmark compensation or target
compensation levels at any particular percentile of the survey data. The Committee reviews salaries on an annual basis and generally makes any annual
changes effective January 1st. On occasion, Kraft Heinz may review and adjust an executive’s base salary during the course of the year to account for
increased responsibilities, roles, and other factors. The Committee has sole responsibility for the review of Mr. Hees’s compensation. Mr. Hees has primary
responsibility for the review of the compensation of his direct reports, including the other NEOs, and provides salary recommendations to the Committee.
The table below shows the annualized 2018 base salary for each NEO.
Name  Base Salary
($)
Mr. Hees  1,000,000
Mr. Knopf  500,000
Mr. Basilio  750,000
Mr. Oliveira(1) 560,101
Ms. La Lande(2) 650,000
(1)Mr. Oliveira’s base salary is paid in British pounds. The amount shown in the table above is based on the following 12-month average exchange rate of 0.7499 USD/GBP. Mr. Oliveira’s base
salary was increased effective January 1, 2018 in connection with the Committee’s annual base salary review process.
(2)Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22, 2018.
We believe that the base salary review process serves our pay-for-performance philosophy, because base pay increases are generally merit-based and
dependent on the NEO’s success and achievement in his or her role. In addition, each NEO’s target annual incentive award opportunity, as described below, is
based on a percentage of his or her base salary. Therefore, as NEOs earn merit-based salary increases, their annual incentive award opportunities also increase
proportionately.
225
Annual Cash Performance Bonus Plan
The Performance Bonus Plan (the “PBP”) is designed to motivate and reward employees who contribute positively toward our business strategy and achieve
their individual performance objectives. For 2018, the formula for determining a PBP participant’s annual bonus payout was as follows (each item being
described in more detail below):
Base Salary x Target Award x Financial Multiplier x Individual Rating = PBP Payout
Due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to
the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018, and the Committee approved their forfeitures.
Base Salary
For a description of our NEOs’ base salaries, please see “Base Salary” above. Because Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22, 2018, the base salary used for
her PBP calculation was prorated to reflect her service for 11 months.
Target Award
Each NEO is granted a target award opportunity prior to the beginning of each year, which is set as a percentage of the NEO’s annual base salary: 300% for
Mr. Hees, 175% for Mr. Knopf, 250% for Mr. Basilio, 175% for Mr. Oliveira, and 150% for Ms. La Lande. Due to the nature of Mr. Hees’s role and
responsibilities and the significant nature of Mr. Basilio’s role as President of our largest business, their respective Target Award Opportunities were greater
than the other NEOs, although, as noted above, due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees,
Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018, and the Committee approved their
forfeitures.
Financial Multiplier
Another component of a participant’s PBP calculation is the Company’s (or the relevant Zone’s or business unit’s) financial performance (“Financial
Multiplier”). For 2018, the Financial Multiplier was initially designed to be based on Adjusted EBITDA performance and could have ranged from 0% to
150%, with performance between threshold and maximum levels resulting in a payout between 50% and 150%, and with performance below threshold
resulting in no payout. In June 2018, our management team established a revised business plan for the second half of the 2018 fiscal year (the “2H Plan”).
The 2H Plan was intended to drive net sales (“NSV”) growth by regaining distribution and building velocity to position the Company for long-term financial
health and success. In June 2018, in order to (i) capture overall commercial, operational, and financial performance of the Company and (ii) incentivize
management to deliver the 2H Plan to position the Company for long-term financial health and success, the Committee exercised its discretion under the PBP
to include NSV and Adjusted Net Income as elements of the Financial Multiplier as described below. A participant’s final Financial Multiplier was calculated
based on the metrics aligned to the 2H Plan. As described above, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio forfeited their respective rights to the amounts payable
pursuant to the PBP for 2018. For Mr. Oliveira and Ms. La Lande, the amounts payable calculated pursuant to the metrics aligned to the 2H Plan were greater
than if they had been calculated using the metrics as initially designed.
For 2018, for participants evaluated based on global performance, including Messrs. Hees and Knopf and Ms. La Lande, the Financial Multiplier was
calculated based on global change in Adjusted Net Income. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Adjusted Net Income, the
component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 100%. If the threshold had not been met, the component multiplier would be 0%.
For participants evaluated based on Zone (operating segment) or business unit performance, including Messrs. Basilio and Oliveira, who were evaluated
based on U.S. and EMEA Zone performance, respectively, the Financial Multiplier was calculated based 30% on global change in Adjusted Net Income and
70% based on their respective Zone or business unit financial performances. Zone and business unit financial performance was based 75% on change in NSV
and 25% on change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA. If performance resulted between the threshold and target levels for NSV, the component multiplier would
have ranged from 60% to 100%, depending on the Zone. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Segment Adjusted EBITDA,
the component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 130%. For all cases, if the threshold had not been met, the relevant component multiplier would be
0%.

Global Adjusted Net Income Performance(1) (3.5)% 3.4 % 10.2% (3.0)% 62%

*Growth rates reflect budget foreign exchange rates and exclude the impacts of (i) our Venezuelan subsidiary, due to the highly inflationary environment, (ii) our 50.1% interest in our South African
subsidiary, which was sold in May 2018, and (iii) with respect to NSV, fluctuations for dairy commodities that impact pricing terms under related contracts. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net
income/(loss) excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the
sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax
Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined
as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding
integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on
commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating
results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation
(e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses).
(1)When the Committee certified the achievement of performance with respect to Adjusted Net Income performance, fiscal year 2018 consolidated financial statements were still being prepared.
Given the immateriality of any anticipated adjustments, the Committee certified and approved performance at a maximum level of 64%, subject to downward adjustment in management’s
discretion based on the preparation of the 2018 consolidated financial statements.
(2)When the Committee certified performance with respect to EMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA performance, the Committee certified and approved performance at an amount excluding the
impact of the Middle East and Africa (“MEA”) due to one-off inventory amounts related to previous years when MEA was a part of a different operating segment than EMEA.
In 2018, all NEOs exceeded threshold on their Individual Rating and Financial Multiplier components of the PBP calculation. The Committee granted certain
members of management discretion to increase or decrease the final PBP payouts of the other NEOs with up to a 20% variance compared to the amounts as
calculated based on the Base Salaries, Target Awards, Individual Ratings, and Financial Multipliers described above. Had they not forfeited their rights to the
payment, Mr. Hees would have earned a PBP payout of $1,060,000, Mr. Knopf would have earned a PBP payout of $500,000, and Mr. Basilio would have
earned a PBP payout of $1,023,000. Mr. Oliveira received a PBP payout of $733,854, and Ms. La Lande received a PBP payout of $543,000. Mr. Hees would
have received a decreased discretionary payout related to the longer-term business initiatives reflected in his MBOs. Messrs. Knopf and Basilio would have
received, and Mr. Oliveira and Ms. La Lande did receive, an increased discretionary payout related to top line growth results and/or strong leadership of
important initiatives in his or her respective area.
Individual Rating
The foundation of each participant’s Individual Rating is our MBO process. At the beginning of each year, the Committee establishes a series of performance
goals, or MBOs, that are established based on the Company’s corporate strategy, and performance goals are then “cascaded” throughout the organization.
First, the Committee establishes MBOs for Mr. Hees. Then, in consultation with the Committee, Mr. Hees establishes corresponding MBOs for each of his
direct reports, including the other NEOs. His direct reports, in turn, establish MBOs for their direct reports. This cascading process allows the Company to
drive initiatives that are aligned throughout the organization.
Each NEO has an MBO comprised of multiple goals or objectives. For each goal, there are one or more “Key Performance Indicators,” or KPIs. KPIs are the
quantitative or qualitative metrics used to track achievement of the goals. We have set forth below a summary of the 2018 MBO goals for each of the NEOs
and the overall performance ascribed by the Committee for each NEO based on his or her performance. None of the individual KPIs are material to
understanding how the PBP operated in 2018.  
Bernardo Hees: Mr. Hees had three MBO goals. These were: (i) “Deliver Kraft Heinz Financial Results”, which was evaluated based on Kraft Heinz’s
financial performance in NSV and Adjusted Net Income, (ii) “Strengthen Innovation and Develop Digital Strategy/Go-to-Market”, which was evaluated
based on the innovation pipeline for 2019 and 2020 and E-commerce and digital innovation, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business”, which
was evaluated based on the supply chain planning system and business expansion. Based on Mr. Hees’s performance, he was given an overall performance
score of 66%.
David Knopf: Mr. Knopf had three MBO goals. These were (i) “Deliver Kraft Heinz Financial Results”, which was evaluated based on Kraft Heinz’s
financial performance in Adjusted Net Income and operating free cash flow, (ii) “Increase KHC Financial Efficiency”, which was evaluated based on tax
performance compared to budget and project-specific goals, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business”, which was evaluated based on business
expansion and project-specific goals. Based on Mr. Knopf's performance, he was given an overall performance score of 82%.
227
Paulo Basilio: Mr. Basilio had three MBO goals. These were (i) “Deliver Kraft Heinz Results”, which was evaluated based on case fill rates and U.S.
financial performance in contribution margin and NSV, (ii) “Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&D Pipeline,” which was evaluated based on market
share and the innovation pipeline for 2019 in the U.S. Zone, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Foster the Business”, which was evaluated based on initiatives
relating to Kraft Heinz’s Springboard platform. Based on Mr. Basilio’s performance, he was given an overall performance score of 84%.
Rafael Oliveira: Mr. Oliveira had three MBO goals. These were (i) “Deliver Kraft Heinz EMEA Financial Results,” which was evaluated based on EMEA
financial performance in contribution margin and NSV, (ii) “Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&D Pipeline,” which was evaluated based on market
share and the innovation pipeline for 2019 in the EMEA Zone, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Foster the Business,” which was evaluated based on
foodservice growth in EMEA and NSV growth in MEA. Based on Mr. Oliveira’s performance, he was given an overall performance score of 84%.
Rashida La Lande: Ms. La Lande had three MBO goals. These were (i) “Deliver Effective and Efficient Legal Services,” which was evaluated based on
project-specific goals and legal victories, financial and EBITDA partnerships with the business, and legal victories from ongoing litigation, (ii) “Protect and
Promote our Innovations and Brands,” which was evaluated based on Board projects and crisis management design and preparation for the U.S. and Canada,
and (iii) “Ethics and Compliance” which was evaluated based on the Company’s ethics and compliance initiatives worldwide. Based on Ms. La Lande’s
performance, she was given an overall performance score of 95%.
Annual Bonus Swap Program - Restricted Stock Units
As part of its commitment to fostering an ownership mentality, Kraft Heinz permits certain employees to participate in an annual bonus swap program (the
“Bonus Swap Program”). Under the Bonus Swap Program, eligible employees can elect to invest a portion of their annual PBP payout in our common stock
(we refer to these purchased shares as “Investment Shares”) and leverage that investment through the issuance of matching RSUs (we refer to these RSUs as
“Matching RSUs”). The Matching RSUs cliff vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant subject to continued employment and the retention of the
Investment Shares as described below. To participate in the Bonus Swap Program, eligible employees can elect to use 0%, 25% or 50% of their calculated net
bonus (after deducting an amount based on a normalized tax rate depending on country of residence) to purchase Investment Shares. The number of
Investment Shares purchased is calculated as the product of the calculated net bonus and the swap election percentage, divided by the closing price reported
on the Nasdaq on the date of purchase:
 Calculated Net Bonus x Swap Election %=# of Investment Shares 
 Nasdaq Closing Price  
The number of Matching RSUs a participant received in 2018 was based on (1) the participant’s gross bonus payout in 2018 relating to the 2017 fiscal year
(before-tax) and (2) a discretionary multiplier associated with the participant’s level in the organization and his or her investment election percentage.
In 2018, only Mr. Oliveira participated in the Bonus Swap Program, as he was the only NEO to receive a PBP bonus payment related to 2017. The following
table sets forth, for Mr. Oliveira, the portion of his fiscal 2017 bonus used to purchase Investment Shares (the “Conversion Amount”), the number of
Investment Shares purchased, and the number of Matching RSUs granted to him (which Matching RSUs were granted in 2018):
Name  Conversion Amount
($)  Investment Shares
(#)  2017 Bonus Matching
RSUs granted in 2018
(#)
Mr. Oliveira  121,807  1,821  6,622
Under our Bonus Swap Program, so long as the Matching RSUs remain unvested, if an employee transfers any of the related Investment Shares, he or she
immediately forfeits a proportional amount of the corresponding Matching RSUs. The Committee believes that the Bonus Swap Program as a whole and the
forfeitability of the Matching RSUs in particular, strongly motivates eligible employees to hold Kraft Heinz common stock for the long-term, further
emphasizing a long-term view in creating stockholder value. Prior to 2016, the Company issued matching stock options rather than Matching RSUs in the
Bonus Swap Program.
228
Discretionary Equity Awards
From time to time, we may make discretionary equity awards to employees. Historically, these discretionary awards have been made in the form of stock
options. These stock options are granted with an exercise price based on the fair market value of a Kraft Heinz share on the grant date and cliff vest after a
five-year period. In 2018, the Committee approved discretionary option awards of 44,850 stock options to Mr. Knopf and 52,325 stock options to Ms. La
Lande in order to continue to align a portion of their long-term incentive compensation directly with stockholders’ interests. The options have an exercise
price of $66.89 and will cliff vest on March 1, 2023, subject to continued employment through that date.
In March 2018, the Company issued additional PSUs to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals, including all of
our NEOs, in order to place a significant portion of their compensation at risk if performance goals are not achieved. These PSUs could be earned over a
three-year performance period based on Kraft Heinz’s achievement of financial performance metrics based on Adjusted EBITDA for the period beginning in
January 2018 and ending at the end of December 2020. Once earned, to promote retention of key talent, the PSUs will remain subject to a continued service
requirement through March 1, 2023. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to
be zero.
In March 2018, in order to further retain and motivate top talent and align the interests of management with those of the Company’s stockholders, the
Company also issued RSUs, separately from the Bonus Swap Program, to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals,
including all of our NEOs. These RSUs will cliff vest on March 1, 2023, subject to continued employment.
Additional information about the stock option, PSU, and RSU awards is provided in the 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table and the 2018 Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table below.
Benefits and Perquisites
In addition to base salary, our PBP, and long-term equity grants, we provided and continue to provide certain executive benefit programs to our NEOs. Kraft
Heinz maintains defined contribution retirement plans to allow employees to save for retirement in a tax-efficient manner. These plans are broadly available
to eligible employees and do not discriminate in favor of the NEOs or other members of senior management. None of the NEOs participate in any defined
benefit pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, or supplemental retirement or executive savings plans.
Kraft Heinz also provides health and welfare insurance benefits to employees, including the NEOs. These benefits include life, disability, and health insurance
benefit plans that are broadly available to eligible employees and do not discriminate in favor of the NEOs or other members of senior management.
From time to time, Kraft Heinz provides limited perquisite benefits. For example, we provide limited tax advisory services, immigration benefits, and
reimbursement of certain relocation expenses for business reasons. Kraft Heinz provides other limited perquisite benefits, which are detailed in the 2018
Summary Compensation Table.
Minimum Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our compensation programs promote a strong alignment of the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. For example, in order to participate
in our Bonus Swap Program, each participant must use a significant portion of his or her bonus to purchase our common stock. In 2016, we adopted minimum
stock ownership guidelines, which require our NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership measured based on a multiple of his or her annual base
salary, as set forth below:
Role  Minimum Ownership
CEO  5x Base Salary
Other Named Executive Officers  3x Base Salary
The stock ownership guidelines require NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership within five years from the later of December 8, 2016 and the date
of the NEO’s appointment to a position subject to the guidelines. For more details on the stock ownership of our NEOs, please refer to “Ownership of Equity
Securities.”
229
Clawback, Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies
Our stock option, PSU, and RSU award agreements provide that, in certain circumstances, the award and any proceeds or other benefits a participant may
receive may be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to Kraft Heinz to the extent required to comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws
and/or the rules. Further, if a participant receives any amount in excess of what he or she should have received under the terms of the award for any reason
(including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations, or administrative error), all as determined by the Committee, then
he or she will be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to Kraft Heinz. Our insider trading policy also limits the timing and types of transactions
in Kraft Heinz securities by executive officers, including our NEOs. Among other restrictions, the policy prohibits holding Kraft Heinz securities in a margin
account or pledging Kraft Heinz securities as collateral for a loan without advance written notice to the Corporate Secretary. In addition, the policy prohibits
short-selling Kraft Heinz securities, transacting in puts, calls, or other derivatives on Kraft Heinz securities, or hedging transactions on Kraft Heinz securities
without prior approval from the Corporate Secretary.
Impact of Tax and Accounting Policies
When determining total direct compensation packages, the Committee considers all factors that may have an impact on our financial performance, including
tax and accounting rules and regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits our ability to deduct compensation
paid to “covered employees” (as defined in the Code) to the extent such compensation exceeds $1 million to such employee in any fiscal year. For taxable
years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, there was a performance-based exception to this rule that permitted us to deduct compensation that met certain
qualifying performance-based criteria. This performance-based exception no longer applies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that
compensation paid to our “covered employees” in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for limited transition relief applicable to
certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.
Despite the Committee’s intentions to structure the Company’s incentive programs for taxable years commencing prior to January 1, 2018 in a manner
intended to be exempt from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m), there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of the limited
transition relief and satisfy the requirements for such exemption. Further, the Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended
to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs.

(1)On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. Mr. Hees forfeited the PSU and RSU awards granted in 2018 (aggregate grant date fair value of $25,483,713)
due to the performance of the business and his decision to leave the company, respectively. Therefore, the Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules paid to Mr. Hees in 2018 was
$1,149,136.
(2)The amounts shown in this column include the aggregate grant date fair value, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of (i) Matching RSUs, (ii) PSUs, and (iii) RSUs granted to
the NEOs. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the
valuation of the awards in this column, see Note 12, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Under our Bonus Swap Program, the Matching
RSUs for the NEOs were calculated as the product of the calculated gross bonus and the swap election percentage, divided by the closing price reported on the Nasdaq on the date of purchase.
For a discussion of the terms applicable to the Matching RSUs, PSUs, and RSUs as well as vesting, forfeiture, and other terms, see “Elements of Compensation Program” in the CD&A.
(3)As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. For Mr. Hees, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $17,838,582. For Mr. Knopf, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on March 1, 2018 was $4,162,349. For Mr. Basilio, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $11,892,369. For Mr. Oliveira, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on March 1, 2018 was $5,946,213. For Ms. La Lande, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $1,486,582. The grant date fair value for the PSU award granted on March 1, 2018 was $56.82.
For Mr. Hees, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $7,645,131. On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his
departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018. For Mr. Knopf, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $1,783,864. For Mr. Basilio, the grant date value of
the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $5,096,754. For Mr. Oliveira, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $2,548,377. For Ms. La Lande, the grant date value of the
RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $1,486,582. The grant date fair value for the RSU awards was $66.89 for award granted on March 1, 2018 under the bonus swap program and was $56.82 for
non-dividend eligible award granted on March 1, 2018.
(4)Amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of discretionary option awards granted to the NEOs. The values of the stock option awards are equal to their grant
date fair value as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of the stock option awards in this column, see Note 12,
Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
231
(5)Amounts reported in this column reflect compensation earned for 2018 performance under our PBP. As discussed in the CD&A and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, due to
the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP
with respect to fiscal year 2018 and the Committee approved their forfeitures. The bonuses were paid in cash to each other NEO after the end of 2018.
(6)For Mr. Hees, represents dividend equivalents that accrued on Matching RSUs ($128,176), a matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage. For Mr. Knopf,
represents a matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), dividend equivalents that accrued on Matching RSUs, and basic life insurance coverage. For Mr. Basilio, represents dividend
equivalents that accrued on Matching RSUs ($63,609), a matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage. For Mr. Oliveira, represents dividend equivalents
that accrued on Matching RSUs ($42,298), tax support, and a matching contribution to the UK contribution scheme. For Ms. La Lande, represents payment for relocation expenses ($66,664), a
matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage.
(7)To supplement the SEC-required disclosure in the other columns of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, we have included this additional column, which shows “Total Compensation as
Adjusted from SEC Rules” representing the portion of the “Total Compensation” available to each NEO in each of the years shown. We are presenting this supplemental column to show how
the Committee views the NEOs’ compensation for each of the years shown. The “Total Compensation” column as calculated under SEC rules includes several items that are not necessarily
reflective of compensation available to the NEOs in a particular year. Amounts reported in the “Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” column differ substantially from the amounts
determined under SEC rules as reported in the “Total Compensation” column. “Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” is not a substitute for “Total Compensation.” “Total
Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” represents: (1) “Total Compensation,” as calculated under applicable SEC rules, minus (2) the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards (as
reflected in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns), and plus (3) the value realized from any exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs or PSUs before payment of any
applicable withholding taxes and brokerage commissions (as reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested tables of the proxy statements for the respective years), including the value
realized from the payment of any dividend equivalents. In addition, “Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” reflects any bonus paid in each of the years shown, whereas the “Total
Compensation” column calculated pursuant to the SEC rules reflects any bonus earned for the applicable years (regardless of when paid and not taking into account any subsequent forfeitures
thereof).
(8)Foreign currency conversion based on daily average for calendar year 2018. Mr. Oliveira’s base salary is paid in British pounds. The amounts shown in the table above are based on the
following 12-month average exchange rate: British pounds (.7499 USD/GBP).
232
Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table
The following table sets forth information regarding the grant of plan-based awards for each of the NEOs in 2018. As described in the CD&A, due to the
difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio have forfeited their rights to the amounts
payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018.

(1)For Messrs. Hees and Knopf and Ms. La Lande, the PBP is based on global change in Adjusted Net Income and has a Threshold assumption of 60% and Maximum assumption of 100%.
Threshold amounts also assume a minimum individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. The actual payment would be
based on achievement of individual and financial performance goals. Annual incentive award payments, to the extent not forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based
on actual results achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.
(2)On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018.
(3)For Mr. Basilio, the US Zone PBP is based 75% on change in U.S. NSV and 25% on change in U.S. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and has a Threshold assumption of 60%, and Maximum
assumption of 90% for NSV change and 130% for Segment Adjusted EBITDA change. Threshold amounts also assume an individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts
assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. Mr. Basilio’s actual payment is based on achievement of individual goals and would receive a weighting on financial performance split by 70% of the
US Zone metrics plus 30% of the global metrics. Annual incentive award payments, to the extent not forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based on actual results
achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.
(4)For Mr. Oliveira, the EMEA Zone PBP is based 75% on change in EMEA NSV and 25% on change in EMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA and has a Threshold assumption of 70% for NSV
change and 60% for Segment Adjusted EBITDA change, and Maximum assumption of 100% for NSV change and 130% for Segment Adjusted EBITDA change. Threshold amounts also
assume an individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. Mr. Oliveira’s actual payment is based on achievement of individual
goals and will receive a weighting on financial performance split by 70% of the EMEA Zone metrics plus 30% of the global metrics. Annual incentive award payments, to the extent not
forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based on actual results achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity
Incentive Plan Compensation.

(5)The PSUs granted on March 1, 2018 were granted under the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The target number of shares shown in the table reflects the number of shares of common stock that
will be earned if each of the performance metrics are achieved at target levels by the end of 2020. If 80% of the performance metrics are not achieved by the end of 2020, the target and threshold
opportunities roll over to 2021 with a 20 percentage point payout penalty. Actual shares awarded will vest on March 1, 2023 provided the awardee also meets certain requirements. Dividends are
not earned on the PSUs. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero.

(1)For all Matching RSUs, this total includes dividends that are reinvested at the dividend payment date in additional RSUs that are subject to the same restrictions as the original grant. The
Matching RSUs granted on March 1, 2016, March 1, 2017, and March 1, 2018 are scheduled to vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
(2)The market value of the shares that have not vested is based on the closing price of $43.57 for Kraft Heinz common stock on December 28, 2018, the last trading day of our fiscal year, as
reported on Nasdaq.
(3)100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on August 20, 2020.
(4)100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on February 12, 2020. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(5)100% of these awards vested on February 14, 2019, and they are scheduled to expire on February 14, 2024. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015

(6)100% of these awards vested on July 1, 2018, and they are scheduled to expire on July 1, 2023. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(7)100% of the award is scheduled to vest on March 1, 2022.
(8)As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. The shares reported in this row represent potentially issuable
shares under the PSU award granted on March 1, 2017, which cliff vest on March 1, 2022. The PSUs represent the right to receive a variable number of Kraft Heinz shares based on Kraft
Heinz’s actual performance during a define performance period. If 80% of the performance target is achieved in 2019, the participant will receive 70% of the underlying shares. If 80% of the
performance target is achieved in 2020, participant will receive 65% of the underlying shares and if 80% of the performance target is achieved in 2021, the participant will receive 60% of the
underlying shares. The number of shares reported in this row is based on threshold performance. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on the PSUs. If the participant is terminated prior to March
1, 2020, he or she will forfeit the entire award. The PSUs will vest as earned on March 1, 2022.
(9)100% of the award is scheduled to vest on March 1, 2021.
(10)100% of the award is scheduled to vest on May 21, 2019. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.
(11)100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on March 1, 2023.
(12)100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on March 1, 2023, and the RSU awards are not dividend eligible.
(13)As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. The shares reported in these rows represent potentially issuable
shares under the PSU award granted on March 1, 2018, which cliff vest on March 1, 2023. The PSUs represent the right, to the extent not forfeited, to receive a variable number of Kraft Heinz
shares based on Kraft Heinz’s actual performance during a defined performance period. If the threshold of the performance target is achieved by the end of 2020, the participant will receive
80% of the underlying shares. If the threshold for the performance target is not achieved by the end of 2020, the target and threshold opportunities roll over to 2021 with a 20 percentage point
payout penalty. The number of shares reported in these rows is based on threshold performance. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on the PSUs. If the participant is terminated prior to March
1, 2021, he or she will forfeit the entire award. The PSUs will vest as earned on March 1, 2023 provided the awardee also meets certain requirements.
(14)On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018.

(1)No enhanced severance is provided on a termination in connection with a change in control. Kraft Heinz does not have a specified Change in Control Plan for executives, and treatment is
determined by the plan agreements and local regulations applicable to each employee. Our Severance Pay Plan generally provides for 12 months of base salary with a signed release of claims.
The Severance Pay Plan would also include Company-paid COBRA for U.S.-based employees for the severance period and outplacement services.
(2)Relates to termination due to death, disability, or normal retirement.
(3)As of the last day of 2018, in the event of a termination without cause or due to retirement, death, or disability, stock options vest as if 20% of the options vested on each annual anniversary date
of the specific grant. Amounts reflect the intrinsic value of shares underlying options that would vest, calculated as the difference between $43.57, the closing price of Kraft Heinz common stock
on December 28, 2018 (the last trading day of our fiscal year, as reported on Nasdaq), and the exercise price of the options. Amounts also include the vesting of Matching RSUs granted in 2016
at a pro rata rate of 20% of the RSUs as if they vested on each annual anniversary date of the grant. The 2017 Matching RSUs and 2018 RSUs and Matching RSUs are not presented in this table
because no pro rata vesting would occur if such event occurs prior to the second anniversary of the grant.
(4)Amount reflects 12 months of medical and dental benefit coverage continuation under COBRA, less the executive premium contribution. As noted in the CD&A, due to the difficult operating
environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal
year 2018 and the Committee approved their forfeitures.
237
(5)The Committee and Board approved a bonus to Mr. Hees in connection with his separation from the Company, $1,084,000, which represents his pro rata portion of his 2019 bonus based on an
85% performance rating and 85% Individual Rating.
Severance Pay Plan
Generally, Kraft Heinz provides for severance benefits to U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based NEOs, pursuant to the terms of the U.S.
Severance Pay Plan. The severance benefits for non-U.S.-based salaried employees are made pursuant to the local laws and regulations governing the
jurisdiction in which they work, subject to adjustment at the discretion of Kraft Heinz for employees at certain organizational levels (such benefits, together
with the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, are referred to as the “Severance Pay Plan”).
NEOs are eligible for severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan upon an involuntary termination of employment, such as job elimination, location
closing, or reduction in the workforce. NEOs must be willing to provide satisfactory transitional assistance in order to be eligible for severance benefits.
Pursuant to the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, Messrs. Hees, Basilio, and Knopf and Ms. La Lande would generally be eligible to receive a severance payment
equal to 12 months of base salary upon the execution of a release of claims against Kraft Heinz. In addition, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
authorize payment of additional severance in respect of a participant’s annual bonus opportunity. Although Mr. Oliveira is not based in the U.S. and not
otherwise covered by the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, the Company has determined that he is eligible to receive the same benefits as the other NEOs. Severance
payments are generally made in a cash lump-sum, but may occasionally be made in periodic payments at Kraft Heinz’s discretion as soon as administratively
feasible after the termination of employment and after the former NEO’s executed release has become irrevocable.
On April 22, 2019, Kraft Heinz announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. On June 5, 2019, the Committee approved the following
severance terms for Mr. Hees, which will become payable following Mr. Hees’s termination of employment and subject to his execution of a release of claims
against Kraft Heinz: (1) a severance payment equal to 12 months of base salary, and (2) a pro-rata payment of his annual bonus under the PBP assuming
performance at 85%, both with respect to the metrics related to Kraft Heinz’s financial performance (i.e., the “Financial Multiplier”) and Mr. Hees’s MBOs
(i.e., the “Individual Rating”). Mr. Hees’ outstanding equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms set forth in the governing agreements as
described below.
No enhanced severance is provided on a termination in connection with a change in control of Kraft Heinz, and Kraft Heinz does not maintain any individual
change in control severance or other similar agreements with any of the NEOs. None of the NEOs are entitled to receive a gross-up for golden parachute taxes
that may become payable pursuant to Section 280G of the Code in connection with a change in control of Kraft Heinz.
Equity Awards
Generally, as of the last day of 2018, in the event of involuntary termination without cause, retirement, death, and disability, the stock options granted to the
NEOs would vest as if 20% of the shares vested on each annual anniversary date of the specific grant, and for all other terminations and for voluntary
resignations, the unvested stock options would be forfeited. In addition, as of the last day of 2018, beginning on the termination date, the exercise period was
90 days for termination without cause and one year for retirement, death, and disability. In April 2019, the Committee modified award agreements for
outstanding equity awards (options, PSUs, Matching RSUs, and RSUs) with respect to the treatment upon a termination due to death, disability, or retirement.
Such terminations, for option awards on or after the first anniversary of the specific grant date, and for RSU and Matching RSU awards on or after the
anniversary deadlines outlined in the award agreements, would result in such awards being fully vested and exercisable, in the case of PSUs, to the extent the
performance conditions had been satisfied. In addition, the Committee modified award agreements for outstanding options such that the exercise period for a
termination without cause would be one year.
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, we
determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Hees relative to the annual total compensation of our median employee.
For purposes of reporting annual total compensation and the ratio of annual total compensation of the CEO to the median employee, both the CEO and
median employee’s annual total compensation were calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under the Summary
Compensation Table.
238
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, because there has been no significant change in our employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure, we are utilizing the same median-
compensated employee in our pay ratio calculation as was used in 2017. Our median-compensated employee is a full-time hourly non-U.S. factory employee.
To identify our median employee last year, we determined the annual total compensation by examining the 2017 annualized base salaries plus target incentive
bonus for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us as of December 1, 2017. In accordance with Item 402(u) and
instructions thereto, we included all full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees worldwide. We believe the use of base salaries plus target
incentive bonus for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure, because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees
and because we believe that this measure reasonably reflects the total annual compensation of our employees.
After applying the methodology described above, our median employee compensation using the Summary Compensation Table requirements was $47,612.
Our CEO’s compensation in the Summary Compensation Table was $29,047,768. Therefore, our CEO to median employee pay ratio (“CEO pay ratio”), a
reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u), is 610:1. The CEO’s total compensation of $29,047,768 included $1,060,000 payable
pursuant to the PBP for 2018, as well as $17,838,582 related to the grant date fair value of PSUs. As noted above, Mr. Hees has decided to forfeit the PBP for
2018, and as of December 29, 2018, the expected payout of those PSUs was determined to be zero based on the probability of future achievement of
performance metrics. If we had excluded the PBP payout for 2018 and the March 2018 PSUs from total CEO compensation, the CEO pay ratio would have
been 213:1.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
INDEPENDENCE AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Independence Determinations
The Guidelines require that a majority of the directors meet Nasdaq listing standards’ “independence” requirements. For a director to be considered
independent, the Board must affirmatively determine, after reviewing all relevant information, that a director has no direct or indirect material relationship
with Kraft Heinz that would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. The Board
determined that, under the Nasdaq listing standards, the following director nominees are independent: Mr. Abel, Mr. Behring, Ms. Cool, Mr. Dewan, Ms.
Jackson, Mr. Lemann, Mr. Pope, Mr. Castro-Neves, and Mr. Van Damme. Warren Buffett and Mackey McDonald, who retired from Board service in 2018,
and Marcel Herrmann Telles, who decided to retire from the Board, effective on June 12, 2019, were also determined to be independent during the periods
they served. Mr. Cahill, the former Chief Executive Officer of Kraft and a current consultant to Kraft Heinz, and George Zoghbi, our former Chief Operating
Officer of the U.S. Commercial business and Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, are not independent.
In conducting its evaluations of Mr. Abel, Mr. Buffett, and Ms. Cool, the Board considered each individual’s affiliation with Berkshire Hathaway, which held
approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2019, and its subsidiaries. Similarly, in conducting its evaluations of Mr. Behring, Mr.
Lemann, Mr. Castro-Neves, and Mr. Telles, the Board considered each individual’s affiliation with 3G Capital, which held approximately 22% of our
outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2019, and its subsidiaries. The Board also considered the service of Messrs. Behring, Castro-Neves, and Van Damme
on the Board of Directors of RBI, a company in which 3G Capital invests and the parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons, quick service restaurant
companies that purchase certain of our products and conduct certain brand sponsorship and marketing activities for us, in conducting its evaluations of them.
Review of Transactions with Related Persons
The Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval, or ratification of “related person transactions.” A “related person transaction” is one in
which Kraft Heinz is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and any “related person” had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material
interest. In general, “related persons” include our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their immediate family members. In accordance with
this policy, the Governance Committee reviews transactions that might qualify as “related person transactions.” If the Governance Committee determines that
a transaction qualifies as a “related person transaction,” then the Governance Committee reviews, and approves, disapproves, or ratifies the “related person
transaction.” The Governance Committee approves or ratifies only those “related person transactions” that are fair and reasonable to Kraft Heinz and in our
and our stockholders’ best interests. Any member of the Governance Committee who is a “related person” with respect to a transaction under review may not
participate in the deliberations or decisions regarding the transaction. The chair of the Governance Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee if the
chair of the Governance Committee is a “related person” with respect to the transaction under review) will review and approve or ratify potential “related
person transactions” when it is not practicable or desirable to delay review of a transaction until a Governance Committee meeting, and will report to the
Governance Committee any transaction so approved or ratified. The Governance Committee, in the course of its review and approval or ratification of a
related person transaction under this policy, considers, among other things:
•the commercial reasonableness of the transaction;
•the materiality of the related person’s direct or indirect interest in the transaction;
•whether the transaction may involve an actual, or the appearance of a, conflict of interest;
•the impact of the transaction on the related person’s independence (as defined in the Guidelines and the Nasdaq listing standards); and
•whether the transaction would violate any provision of our Directors Ethics Code or Code of Conduct.
241
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the 2015 Merger, we entered into a registration rights agreement with 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the
registration rights agreement, we granted 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway registration rights with respect to the shares of Kraft Heinz
common stock held by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger, representing shares of Kraft Heinz
common stock acquired from Heinz in connection with the 2015 Merger and/or immediately prior to the 2015 Merger pursuant to a warrant. The registration
rights only apply to registrable shares and not shares of Kraft Heinz common stock subsequently acquired by either party. These rights include demand
registration rights, shelf registration rights, and “piggyback” registration rights, as well as customary indemnification. The rights are subject to certain
holdback and suspension periods. We generally will bear all fees, costs, and expenses related to registrations, other than underwriting discounts and
commissions attributable to the sale of shares of Kraft Heinz common stock by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway, as applicable.
Demand Registration Rights
The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway demand registration rights. We will be required, upon the
written request of 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway, to file a registration statement pursuant to its demand rights under the registration rights
agreement, as promptly as practicable and to use our reasonable best efforts to effect registration of shares of Kraft Heinz common stock requested to be
registered by 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway, subject to certain exceptions. Each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway
may request up to three demand registrations in the aggregate.
Shelf Registration Rights
The registration rights agreement also grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway shelf registration rights. Subject to our eligibility to
use a Registration Statement on Form S-3, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway may request that we file a shelf registration statement
with respect to some or all of its shares of Kraft Heinz common stock, and, upon such request, we are required to file such registration statement promptly as
practicable, subject to certain exceptions.
“Piggyback” Registration Rights
The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway “piggyback” registration rights. If we register any of our
shares of common stock, either for our own account or for the account of other stockholders, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway will
be entitled, subject to certain exceptions, to include its shares of common stock in the registration.
Holdback Periods
Notwithstanding the registration rights described above, if there is an offering of shares of Kraft Heinz and the managing underwriters for the offering advise
us that a public sale or distribution of shares outside the offering would adversely affect the offering, then, if requested, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and
Berkshire Hathaway will not dispose of, or request the registration of, any registrable shares for a certain period, which we refer to as a holdback period. The
holdback period will begin on the 10th day before the pricing date of the offering and extend for either (i) 120 days or (ii) an earlier date, if designated by the
managing underwriters.
Suspension Periods
In addition, we may delay or suspend the filing, effectiveness, or use of a registration statement for a certain period, which we refer to as a suspension period,
if we determine that (i) proceeding with the use or effectiveness of the registration statement would require us to disclose material non-public information and
the disclosure of that information at that time would not be in our best interests or (ii) the registration or offering to be delayed or suspended would, if not
delayed or suspended, materially adversely affect us or delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the success of any pending or proposed material
transaction, including any debt or equity financing, any acquisition or disposition, any recapitalization or reorganization or any other material transaction,
whether due to commercial reasons, a desire to avoid premature disclosure of information, or any other reason. During any calendar year, there will not be
more than two suspension periods and the aggregate number of days included in all suspension periods in that year will not exceed 119 days.
242
Shareholders’ Agreement
In connection with the 2015 Merger, 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a shareholders’ agreement that governs how each party
and their affiliates will vote the shares of Kraft Heinz common stock held by them as of the date of closing of the 2015 Merger, with respect to supporting
certain directors who are designated by either 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement, 3G Global Food
Holdings agrees that for so long as Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates control shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in election of directors
of shares owned by Berkshire Hathaway as of the consummation of the 2015 Merger, 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates will vote their shares of
Kraft Heinz common stock in favor of the three Kraft Heinz Board nominees designated by Berkshire Hathaway and not take any action to remove such
designees without Berkshire Hathaway’s consent. Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway agrees that for so long as 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates control
shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in elections of directors of shares owned by 3G Global Food Holdings as of the consummation of the
2015 Merger, Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates will vote their shares of Kraft Heinz common stock in favor of the three Kraft Heinz Board nominees
designated by 3G Global Food Holdings and not take any action to remove such designees without 3G Global Food Holdings’ consent. The shareholders’
agreement provides that each party’s foregoing rights and obligations will step down upon specified reductions in ownership below the 66% threshold
described above by either 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway and their respective affiliates, as applicable.
Consulting Agreement
On November 2, 2017, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Cahill pursuant to which he provides advisory and consulting services to us related to
current and historical finances, relationships with licensors, customers and vendors, employee matters, product development, marketing and distribution,
government affairs and strategic opportunities. Mr. Cahill is paid $500,000 annually under this new consulting agreement, which was approved by the
disinterested members of the Board. Mr. Cahill’s services under the consulting agreement are distinct from his duties as a director. Previously, Mr. Cahill had
provided similar services under a consulting agreement entered into following the 2015 Merger, which had expired in July 2017.
Compensation Arrangement
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company entered into an offer letter (the “Offer Letter”) with Mr. Zoghbi in order to incent Mr. Zoghbi to extend his service
with the Company past January 1, 2017, after a retention bonus pursuant to a prior offer letter entered into upon the closing of the 2015 Merger had been
earned. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zoghbi: (i) continued his current base salary of $850,000; (ii) agreed to a 2017 target annual incentive award opportunity
of 200% (with a maximum bonus multiplier of 130%); and (iii) was granted a long-term equity incentive award. The long-term equity incentive award was
composed of (i) RSUs, which cliff vest after three years, and (ii) PSUs, which cliff vest after three years based on the achievement of U.S. sales growth
targets and U.S. Adjusted EBITDA growth targets. The Offer Letter also eliminated the Section 280G gross-up rights that Mr. Zoghbi had been granted by
Kraft compensation plans prior to the 2015 Merger. In October 2017, Mr. Zoghbi transitioned from his role as President of the U.S. Commercial business to
his role as Special Advisor. As previously disclosed, Mr. Zoghbi was not eligible under the Offer Letter for an annual incentive award in 2018 based on 2017
performance. For as long as Mr. Zoghbi continues to serve as a Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, it is anticipated that he will not receive compensation for his
services as a director.

Pre-Approval Policy
The Audit Committee’s policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. These services may include audit
services, audit-related services, tax services, and other permissible non-audit services. The pre-approval authority details the particular service or category of
service that the independent auditors will perform. The Audit Committee’s policy also requires management to report at Audit Committee meetings
throughout the year on the actual fees charged by the independent auditors for each category of service. The Audit Committee reviews this policy annually.
During the year, circumstances may arise when it may be necessary to engage the independent auditors for additional services not contemplated in the original
pre-approval authority. In those instances, the Audit Committee approves the services before we engage the independent auditors. If pre-approval is needed
before a scheduled Audit Committee meeting, the Audit Committee delegated pre-approval authority to its chair. The chair must report on such pre-approval
decisions at the committee’s next regular meeting.
During fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors.

Exhibit 4.32
DESCRIPTION OF KRAFT HEINZ’S SECURITIES
The following description is a summary that is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Kraft Heinz’s Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (“Certificate of Incorporation”) and Kraft Heinz’s Amended and Restated By-Laws (“By-Laws”).
General
Kraft Heinz is authorized to issue five billion (5,000,000,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and nine hundred twenty thousand
(920,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.
     Under the Certificate of Incorporation, Kraft Heinz may issue preferred stock in one or more series, with preferences, limitations and rights as authorized
by Kraft Heinz’s board of directors, to the extent permitted by Delaware law. The powers (including voting, if any), preferences and relative, participating,
optional and other special rights of each series of preferred stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any
and all other classes and series of preferred stock at any time outstanding. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of Kraft Heinz’s
common shareholders by, among other things:
•restricting dividends on the common stock;
•diluting the voting power of the common stock;
•impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock; or
•delaying or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders.
As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of Kraft Heinz’s common
stock. Kraft Heinz’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the ticker symbol “KHC.” All outstanding shares of
common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Dividend and Liquidation Rights
Subject to the preferences applicable to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at any time, holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock are entitled to
receive dividends when and as declared by its board of directors from assets or funds legally available therefore. The timing, declaration, amount and
payment of future dividends will depend on Kraft Heinz’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt service obligations, as well as legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that Kraft Heinz’s board of directors deems relevant. Kraft Heinz’s board of directors
will make all decisions regarding the payment of dividends from time to time in accordance with applicable law. Subject to any preferential liquidation rights
of holders of preferred stock that may be outstanding, upon Kraft Heinz’s dissolution, the holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock will be entitled to share
ratably in Kraft Heinz’s assets legally available for distribution to Kraft Heinz’s stockholders.
Voting and Other Rights
Each share of common stock outstanding is entitled to one vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. However, except
as required by law, holders of common stock are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of
one or more outstanding class or series of preferred stock if the
1
holders of such affected class or series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such class or series, to vote thereon
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or the Delaware General Corporation Law.
The By-Laws provide that, except as required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which Kraft Heinz’s
capital stock is listed, all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the shareholders shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders
entitled to vote thereon who are present in person or represented by proxy, and where a separate vote by class or series is required, a majority of the votes cast
by the shareholders of such class or series who are present in person or represented by proxy shall be the act of such class or series; provided that the election
of directors shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast or a plurality.
The holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock have no preemptive rights and no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities. Kraft
Heinz’s common stock is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions.
Anti-takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
 General
 The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws contain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the
composition of the board of directors and that could make it more difficult to acquire control of the company by means of a tender offer, open market
purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. A description of these provisions is set forth below.
 No Cumulative Voting
 Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative voting.
The Certificate of Incorporation does not grant shareholders the right to vote cumulatively.
 Blank Check Preferred Stock
 We believe that the availability of the preferred stock under the Certificate of Incorporation provides the company with flexibility in addressing
corporate issues that may arise. Having these authorized shares available for issuance will allow the company to issue shares of preferred stock without the
expense and delay of a special shareholders’ meeting. The authorized shares of preferred stock, as well as shares of common stock, will be available for
issuance without further action by the company’s shareholders, with the exception of any actions required by applicable law or the rules of any stock
exchange on which Kraft Heinz’s securities may be listed. The board of directors will have the power, subject to applicable law, to issue classes or series of
preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the class or series, impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt.
  Shareholder Action by Written Consent
 The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of
Kraft Heinz may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are
signed by the holders of outstanding capital stock of Kraft Heinz having not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize such action at a
meeting at which all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Applicable Definitions
For purposes of this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
“Disability” means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
“disability” (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
“Retirement” means a termination of Service by you on or after either (a) the later of (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your completion of
five years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates or (b) the later of (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your completion of ten
years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
“Without Cause” means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines “Good
Reason”, then “Without Cause” shall also include resignation of your Service for “Good Reason” in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on
this Option and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the Options upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan. In the event that there is a conflict between the
terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a Change in Control on this Option and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the
terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in partial consideration of the Option granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company’s Restrictive Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Taxes
Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe
benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all
Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option grant, including
the grant, vesting or exercise of this Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends
and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to exercise of this Option, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if
permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet
the obligation for Tax-Related Items. Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries any amount of Tax-Related Items that the
Company or its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan or your purchase of Shares that cannot be
satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to
comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service.
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of this Option on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above
titled “Termination”) is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You
further acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed
as giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate. The
receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company’s Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award

(a)    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
(b)    the Option award is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to

compensation or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses,
long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h)    if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, this Option will have no value;
(i)    if you receive Shares, the value of such Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise
Price per Share;
(j)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Options, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value
of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;    
(k)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from termination of your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Option to which you are
otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your
ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and
(l)    this Option is subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments,
Repurchases and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting this Option, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with this Option. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.

Data is the legitimate interests of the Company in administering the Plan, where our interests are not overridden by your data protection
rights.
(b) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company may transfer Data to one or more independent stock plan
service providers, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. Such service

country to the United States, where the Company and its service providers are based. Your country or jurisdiction may have different data

applicable data protection laws in relation to transfer of Data to the United States.
(d) Data Retention. The Company will use your personal data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries
This Option shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death, and this Option shall be
exercised during your lifetime only by you or your guardian or legal representative, except that this Option may be Transferred to one or more
Beneficiaries or other Transferees during your lifetime with the consent of the Committee, and may be exercised by such Transferees in
accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement. A Beneficiary, Transferee, or other person claiming any rights under this Award
Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, except as otherwise determined by the
Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of this Option shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions applicable to this Option and any Shares purchased upon
exercise of this Option that are or would have been applicable to you.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the Options and without prejudice to the terms of the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the Options and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company to the extent required (i) under the terms of any policy adopted by the Company as may be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the Options for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about
this Award Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a
claim with the Commission, (ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this
Award Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation
or proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, you are
advised that you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential
Information (as defined in Exhibit B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies
that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or
proceeding, if such filings are made under seal.
Section 409A
It is intended that the Option awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”)
because it is believed that (i) the Exercise Price per Share may never be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date and the
number of Shares subject to the Option is fixed on the original Grant Date, (ii) the Transfer or exercise of the Option is subject to taxation under
Section 83 of the Code and Treasury Regulation 1.83-7, and (iii) the Option does not include any feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the exercise of the Option. The provisions of this Award Agreement shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with this intention. In the event that the Company believes, at any time, that any benefit or right under this Award Agreement
is subject to Section 409A, then the Committee may (acting alone and without any required consent by you) amend this Award Agreement in
such manner as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to be exempt from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A
(including without limitation, amending the Award Agreement to increase the Exercise Price per Share to such amount as may be required in
order for the Option to be exempt from Section 409A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the Option
awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that any
provision of this Award Agreement, or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.
Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan,
including this Award Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic means with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render it
valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the validity,
legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award Agreement, and the remaining
provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent and purposes of this
Award Agreement.
Interpretation
The Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions that may arise in connection with the Award or this Award Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the
Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with this Award
Agreement or the Plan.

accept as final, conclusive and binding all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Plan or this
Award Agreement.
Appendix I
Notwithstanding any provision in this Award Agreement, if you work or reside outside the U.S., this Option grant shall be subject to
the general non-U.S. terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for your country set forth in Appendix I. Moreover, if you
relocate from the U.S. to one of the countries included in Appendix I or you move between countries included in Appendix I, the general non-
U.S. terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that
the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix I constitutes part of
this Award Agreement.
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the “Company”), and will learn and have access to the Company’s confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me a stock option or other equity grant unless I
made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given a stock option or other equity grant in exchange for
my agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive’s assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive’s Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive’s
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive’s right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company,
(ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive’s Service.
Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive’s Service for any reason (the
“Restricted Period”), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry (“Competitive Business”) anywhere within the same geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive’s
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive’s employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive’s
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term “solicit, aid or
induce” includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product (“Inventions”), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive’s work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive’s Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties with the Company or on Executive’s own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the “Records”), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company’s request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent rights (the “Applications”). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive’s Service, make such
applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company’s rights in the Inventions, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions for the Company’s benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the
Company’s expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all
rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called “moral rights” with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive’s service to the Company that cannot be
assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive
hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon,
including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive’s benefit by virtue of Executive being an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the “Company” as used in this Agreement refers to each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and that each of the Company’s s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive’s obligations to
that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach” as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s Option and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the
Executive’s Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive’s rights, if any,
to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after this Option is granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
February 2019. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in or exercise this Option or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after this Option is granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of this Option be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement
(or other Service contract). The terms and conditions of this Option will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to this Option.
Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement:
For purposes of the Option, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, (i) your right to vest in
the Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service
would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the
jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); and (ii) the period (if any) during which you may
exercise the Option after such termination of your employment or Service relationship will commence as of such date and will not be extended
by any notice period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for
purposes of this Option (including whether you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of this Option upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section
of the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Services and this Option will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a
result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered Options (which, upon exercise in accordance with the terms of the grant of the Options, will be converted
into Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares
are quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

You are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the Options or administration of the Plan. This Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia. In no event will Shares issued upon
exercise of the Option be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exchange Control Information.
You are responsible for complying with any applicable Russian exchange control regulations and rulings. Because Russian exchange control
regulations and rulings change frequently and without notice, you should consult with a legal advisor to ensure compliance applicable to any
aspect of your participation in the Plan, including the grant, vesting and exercise of the Options, issuance of any Shares at exercise, receipt of
any proceeds from the sale of Shares and/or receipt of any payments in connection with any Dividend Equivalents or dividends.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.
Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by these
laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section
of this Appendix I:
By accepting the grant of the Options, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant Options under the Plan to individuals who
may be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon
the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an
ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the Options are granted on the assumption and condition that
the Options or the Shares acquired upon exercise shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance
compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and
conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of
the conditions not be met for any reason, then the Options shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the Options is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
Options will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a "despido
improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause, material
modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute, and/or
Article 50 of the Workers' Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the Options granted to you that were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The Options and the Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Options do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No "offer of
securities to the public," as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has not
been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones (the "DGCI") of the Ministerio de Economia for statistical purposes. This declaration must be made in January for any Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with
a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on your
tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent
years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously reported rights or
assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

Exhibit 10.16
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
FORM OF MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
Unless defined in this award agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto, this "Award Agreement"),
capitalized terms will have the same meanings ascribed to them in The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be
amended from time to time, the "Plan").
Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs") as
of the Grant Date set forth below (the "Grant Date"). The RSUs are granted in connection with your purchase of Shares in the Company's
2018 Bonus Swap Program (the "Related Shares"). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of The
Kraft Heinz Company's (the "Company") common stock on the following terms and subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is
incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of the
Plan will govern.
Grant Date:        
Vesting Date:        
By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit A, the Restrictive Covenants Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Vesting
The RSUs will vest on the "Vesting Date" set forth in this Award Agreement provided that you remain employed by the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled
"Termination"), and subject to forfeiture as set forth in the section below titled "Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs upon the Transfer of Related
Shares." Prior to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares
subject thereto.
Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below
titled "Settlement of Vested RSUs." However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs unless (i) you have complied
with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs and the delivery of such Shares complies with
applicable law and (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items (as defined below) has been received by the
Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable. Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry
on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.
Dividend Equivalents
If while the RSUs are outstanding the Board declares a cash dividend on the Company's common stock, you will be entitled to
Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date established by the Company equal to the cash dividends payable on the same number of
Shares as the number of unvested RSUs subject to this award on the dividend record date established by the Company. Any such Dividend
Equivalents will be in the form of additional RSUs, will be subject to the same terms and vesting dates as the underlying RSUs, and will be
delivered at the same time and in the same manner as the underlying RSUs originally subject to this award. The number of additional RSUs
credited as Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date will be determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of your
unvested RSUs as of the corresponding dividend record date (including any unvested Restricted Stock Units previously credited as a result of
prior payments of Dividend Equivalents) and (B) the per-Share cash dividend paid on the dividend payment date, by (ii) the per-share Fair
Market Value of the Shares on the dividend payment date, rounded down to the nearest whole RSU.
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,
including any accrued Dividend Equivalents, without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the two year anniversary of the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without
Cause (as defined below), as of the date of your termination of Service, your RSUs (plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to
such RSUs) shall be vested as if 20% of the RSUs had previously vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were
providing Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the two year anniversary of the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of
your death, Retirement or Disability (as defined below), as of the date of your termination of Service, your RSUs (plus any Dividend
Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall be fully vested.
Settlement of Vested RSUs
To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such
delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which will vary depending on the applicable vesting
event.
Vesting Event Settlement Period
Vesting DateAs soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following
the Vesting Date
Termination of Service Without Cause Within 60 days of your termination date*
Retirement Within 60 days of your termination date*
Disability Within 60 days of your termination date*
Death Within 60 days of the date of death
*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation as determined by
the Company ("Deferred Compensation"), settlement will occur within this period only if your termination of Service constitutes a
"separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Separation from Service"); otherwise, settlement will occur
in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company determines that you are a "specified
employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are subject to settlement upon your Separation from Service will
instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such Separation from Service, or, if earlier,
upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.
Applicable Definitions
For purposes of this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Disability" means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
"disability" (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
"Retirement" means a termination of Service by you on or following the earlier to occur between (a) (i) your 60th birthday and (ii)
your completion of five (5) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates, and (b) (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your
completion of ten (10) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
"Without Cause" means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines "Good
Reason", then "Without Cause" shall also include resignation of your Service for "Good Reason" in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on
the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Company Sale
The treatment of the RSUs upon a Company Sale shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the RSUs
constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Company Sale will occur within
sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect
of a Company Sale on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in partial consideration of the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs upon the Transfer of Related Shares
Transfer (other than pursuant to the laws of descent) of the Related Shares before the RSUs vest (whether on the Vesting Date or such
earlier date set forth in the section above titled "Termination" or elsewhere in the Award Agreement), will result in immediate forfeiture of all
or a portion of the unvested RSUs granted under this Award Agreement as set forth below:
(i) If you Transfer more than 50% of the Related Shares, you will forfeit all unvested RSUs, including any accrued Dividend Equivalents.
(ii) If you Transfer 50% or less of the Related Shares (the "Transferred Percentage"), you will forfeit a portion of the unvested RSUs
equal to twice the Transferred Percentage, plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs.
Taxes
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security or insurance,
payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-
Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSU grant, including the
grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or
Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability
for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to vesting of the RSUs, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and
absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (B) withhold
the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount, or to the extent permitted by applicable accounting principles,
withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable withholding rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the
short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant tax
withholding event, unless the use of such withholding method is prevented by applicable law or has materially adverse accounting or tax
consequences, in which case, the Tax-Related Items obligation may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods set forth above.
Further, the Company may cause the RSUs to vest prior to the Vesting Date to the extent necessary to satisfy any liability for Tax-
Related Items that arises prior to settlement of the RSUs by means of method (A) or (B) above, provided that to avoid a prohibited acceleration
under Section 409A of the Code for any RSUs that constitute Deferred Compensation, the number of RSUs so vested will not exceed the
number necessary to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items.
Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above titled
"Termination") is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You further
acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed as
giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly
provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any
rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company's Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
(a)    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
(b)    the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;
(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;
(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e)    the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries;
(f)    the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of
same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;
(i)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU resulting from termination of your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise
not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if
any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and
(j)    the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments,
Repurchases and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company's policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal
data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates or any third party
administrator as designated by the Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan.
You understand that the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and/or any other third party administrator as designated by the
Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or social security number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of the RSUs or any
other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor ("Data"), for the
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting
in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country, or elsewhere, and
that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that if you reside
outside the United States,
you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources
representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the
purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as
may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Shares received upon settlement of the RSUs may be
deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the
Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage
and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by
contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You understand that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect your
ability to participate in the Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be affected; the only consequence of
refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other Awards or administer or maintain
such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may
contact your local human resources representative.
Upon request of the Company or your employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form (or any other
agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or your employer) that the Company and/or your employer may deem
necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in
your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will be unable to
participate in the Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the your employer.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries
The RSUs shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, to the extent applicable, as
determined by the Company.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the RSUs and without prejudice to the terms of the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company to the extent required (i) under the terms of any policy adopted by the Company as may be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company.
Section 409A
It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
("Section 409A") and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and operated to reflect this intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award Agreement and the Plan may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to the extent that is necessary or desirable to
exempt the RSUs from Section 409A or satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A, but the Company shall not be under any obligation
to make any such amendment. Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the RSUs
awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that any
provision of this Award Agreement, or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.
Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan,
including this Award Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic means with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render it
valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the validity,
legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award Agreement,
and the remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent
and purposes of this Award Agreement.
Interpretation
The Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions that may arise in connection with the Award or this Award Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the
Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with this Award
Agreement or the Plan.

Award Agreement.

general non-U.S. terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for your country set forth in Appendix I. Moreover, if you relocate

Award Agreement.
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the "Company"), and will learn and have access to the Company's confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me RSUs or other equity grants unless I made such
promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given RSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not
patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how, developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments,
drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary
information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium)
whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or potential business, activities and/or operations of the
Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition,
promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that
Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the
course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either during the period of Executive's Service or at any time
thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary information received from third parties subject to a duty on the
Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each
case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was
known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive
through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law,
regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the
contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of
such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director , partner , joint venturer , manager , member , principal, agent, or independent contractor , individually , in concert
with other s, or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the
Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which
the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food
and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive performed
services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being
a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in
competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any
work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on
Executive's own time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to
the Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual
property protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner
prescribed by the Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company.
The Records shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of
Service, or upon the Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and
all patents or other intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to
Executive's Service, together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee),
applications for patents and equivalent rights (the "Applications"). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to
Executive's Service, make such applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be
requested from time to time by the Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the
Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the
Company (or its designee) of the Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the
giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the
Company, but entirely at the Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all
rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be
assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive
hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of
the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the
aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the
restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and
that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that
Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive
will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the
reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this
Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates
will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable,
subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's RSU and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the
U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the RSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
January 2018. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the Award Agreement titled "Settlement of Vested RSUs," if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:
For purposes of the RSU, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section of
the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result
of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:
If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your death
to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another individual
during your lifetime.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:
(a)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights
or compensation.
(b)    In no event should the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
(c)    The RSU, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for any purpose.
(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Language Consent.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that it is your express intent that this Award
Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up
in English.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker's country, if different, which may affect your ability to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as
you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) "tipping" third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and acknowledge that you should consult with
your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired upon
vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to
sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company for breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

You should not rely upon any oral statements made in relation to this offer. You should rely only upon the statements contained in the Award
Agreement and the Additional Documents when considering participation in the Plan.
Securities Law Notification
Investment in Shares involves a degree of risk. If you elect to participate in the Plan, you should monitor your participation and consider all risk
factors relevant to the acquisition of Shares under the Plan as set out in the Award Agreement and the Additional Documents.

You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Plan.
Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business

dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.
Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.
Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.
The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."
The Shares are not liable to any further calls for payment of capital or for other assessment by the Company and have no sinking fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.

Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.

exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.

Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and RSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs must
be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares are
acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the
Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a
personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.
CHINA

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Italian residents who, during the fiscal year, hold investments abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and RSUs) which may
generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no
tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or foreign
financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and RSUs), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering provisions.
Tax on Foreign Financial Assets.
Italian residents may be subject to tax on the value of financial assets held outside of Italy. The taxable amount will be the fair market value of
the financial assets, including Shares assessed at the end of the calendar year. If you are subject to this foreign financial assets tax, you will
need to report the value of your financial assets held abroad in your annual tax return. You are encouraged to consult your personal legal
advisor for additional information about the foreign financial assets tax.

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

years, as measured from the end of the year in which such transaction occurred.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.

Data Privacy Section of the Award Agreement and by participating in the Plan, you agree to such terms. In this regard, upon request of the
Company or your employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form to your employer or the Company (or any other

that the Award Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. You
are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the RSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia. In no event will Shares issued upon
vesting of the RSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exchange Control Information.
Under current exchange control regulations, within a reasonably short time after sale of the Shares acquired under the Plan or receipt of
dividends on the Shares, you must repatriate the sale proceeds or dividends to Russia. Such funds must be initially credited to you through a
foreign currency account at an authorized bank in Russia. After the funds are initially received in Russia, they may be further remitted to
foreign banks subject to the following limitations: (i) the foreign account may be opened only for individuals; (ii) the foreign account may not
be used for business activities; and (iii) you must give notice to the Russian tax authorities about the opening/closing of each foreign account
within one month of the account opening/closing. Cash dividends (but not dividend equivalents) and cash income received from the transfer of
funds and/or Shares into the fiduciary/trust management of a non-resident do not need to be remitted to your bank account in Russia but instead
can be remitted directly to a foreign individual bank account (in Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") and Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") countries (such as the United States)). As
from January 1, 2018, cash proceeds from the sale of Shares listed on the Russian stock exchange or a foreign exchange on the legally approved
list, also can be paid directly to your foreign bank account opened with a bank located in an OECD or FATF country.
You are encouraged to contact your personal advisor before remitting your sale proceeds or any dividends to Russia as exchange control
requirements may change and significant penalties apply in the case of non-compliance with the exchange control requirements.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.
Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by these
laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the first paragraph of the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and
Conditions section of this Appendix I:
By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may
be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the
express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an
ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and condition that the
RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In
addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you
acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason,
then the RSUs shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the RSUs is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
RSUs will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a
"despido improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause,
material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute,
and/or Article 50 of the Workers' Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the RSUs granted to you that were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones (the "DGCI") of the Ministerio de Economia for statistical purposes. This declaration must be made in January for any Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with
a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on your
tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent
years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously reported rights or
assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

amended from time to time, the "Plan").
Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs") as
of the Grant Date set forth below (the "Grant Date"). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of The
Kraft Heinz Company's (the "Company") common stock on the following terms and subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is

attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
EXHIBIT A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Vesting
The RSUs will vest on the "Vesting Date" set forth in this Award Agreement subject to your continued Service (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, service as a consultant or advisor) with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or
this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled "Termination"). Prior to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs,
you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares subject thereto.
Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below titled
"Settlement of Vested RSUs." However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs prior to the fulfillment of all of the
following conditions: (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs and
the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law, (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items (as
defined below), (iv) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares are then listed, (v) the completion of any
registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem
necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares
would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (vi) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state,
federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (vii) the
lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the RSUs become payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for
reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect
to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.
Termination
Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting
Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,
without any consideration due to you.
If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the three year anniversary of the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without
Cause (as defined below), as of the date of your termination of Service, your RSUs shall be vested as if 30% of the RSUs had previously vested
on the third anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service and 60% of the RSUs has previously vested on the fourth
anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the three year anniversary of
the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your death, Retirement or Disability (as defined below), as of the date of your termination
of Service, your RSUs shall be fully vested.
Settlement of Vested RSUs
To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of
Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which
will vary depending on the applicable vesting event.
Vesting Event Settlement Period
Vesting DateAs soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following
the Vesting Date
Termination of Service Without Cause Within 60 days of your termination date*
Retirement Within 60 days of your termination date*
Disability Within 60 days of your termination date*
Death Within 60 days of the date of death
*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation, within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Company ("Deferred Compensation"), settlement will occur within this period only if
your termination of Service constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Separation from
Service"); otherwise, settlement will occur in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than
sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company determines that you are a "specified
employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are Deferred Compensation and are subject to settlement upon your
Separation from Service will instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such
Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.
Applicable Definitions
All capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. For purposes of this
Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Disability" means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to perform your duties for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service and such Employment Agreement contains a different definition of
"disability" (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.
"Employment Agreement" means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its Affiliates,
including an offer letter.
"Retirement" means a termination of Service by you on or following the earlier to occur between (a) (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your
completion of five (5) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates, and (b) (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your
completion of ten (10) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.
"Without Cause" means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines "Good
Reason", then "Without Cause" shall also include resignation of your Service for "Good Reason" in accordance with such Employment
Agreement.
Special Termination Provisions
In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on
the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
If you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to such
termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause, subject to anything to the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
Effect of a Change in Control
The treatment of the RSUs upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the RSUs
constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will occur
within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the
effect of a Change in Control on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
Restrictive Covenants
Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in partial consideration of the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.
Taxes
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all
income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related
Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any
aspect of the RSU grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
settlement and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of
the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.
Prior to vesting of the RSUs, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in
addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you
acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (B) withhold the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding
amount, or to the extent permitted by applicable accounting principles, withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable
withholding rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, you may elect the
form of withholding in advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of your election, the Company shall deduct the
number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the vesting of the RSUs, or the
Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.
Further, the Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of the RSUs or sale of Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of the Tax-Related Items withholding due or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the
Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be
deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the
purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be,
by withholding from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer.
Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.
No Guarantee of Continued Service
You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above titled
"Termination") is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You further
acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed as
giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly
provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any
rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.
Company's Right of Offset
If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award
In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:
(a)    the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;
(b)    the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;
(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;
(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e)    the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the
Company or its Subsidiaries;
(f)    the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of
same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;
(i)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU resulting from termination of your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise
not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if
any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and
(j)    the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, certain provisions regarding Adjustments,
Repurchases and Transfers).
Securities Laws
By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company's policies regarding
trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.
Data Privacy
You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal
data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates or any third party
administrator as designated by the Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan.
You understand that the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and/or any other third party administrator as designated by the
Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or social security number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of the RSUs or any
other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor ("Data"), for the
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting
in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country, or elsewhere, and
that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that if you reside
outside the United States, you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your
local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data,
in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any
requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the Shares received upon
settlement of the RSUs may be deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and
manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States you may, at any time, view Data, request
information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents
herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You understand that refusal or
withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein
on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be
affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other
Awards or administer or maintain such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.
Upon request of the Company or your employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form (or any other
agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or your employer) that the Company and/or your employer may deem
necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in
your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will be unable to
participate in the Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or your employer.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries
The RSUs shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Committee.
No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, to the extent applicable, as
determined by the Company.
Repayment/Forfeiture
As an additional condition of receiving the RSUs and without prejudice to the terms of the Company's Restrictive Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture and/or repayment to the Company to the extent required (i) under the terms of any policy adopted by the Company as may be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules and regulations of the securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about
this Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with
the Commission, (ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation or
proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, you are
advised that you shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential Information (as defined in Exhibit
B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (i) in confidence to a
federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made
under seal.
Section 409A
It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
("Section 409A") and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and operated to reflect this intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award Agreement and the Plan may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to the extent that is necessary or desirable to
exempt the RSUs from Section 409A or satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A, but the Company shall not be under any obligation
to make any such amendment. Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates do not make any representation to you that the RSUs
awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be exempt from or satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party for any tax, additional tax, interest or penalties that you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other party may incur in the event that any
provision of this Award Agreement, or any amendment or modification thereof or any other action taken with respect thereto, is deemed to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.
Entire Agreement; Modification
The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.
Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan,
including this Award Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. The Award Agreement if delivered by electronic means with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.
Agreement Severable
This Award Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that any provision of this Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law
or rule in any jurisdiction, then that provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination
to the degree necessary to render it valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this
Award Agreement or the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement
that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award
Agreement, and the remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent
the intent and purposes of this Award Agreement.
Interpretation
The Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions that may arise in connection with the Award or this Award Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the
Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with this Award
Agreement or the Plan.
Language
If you have received this Award Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and
if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.
Acknowledgments
By signing this Award Agreement, you acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Plan and represent that you are familiar with the terms and
conditions of the Plan, and hereby accept the RSUs subject to all provisions in this Award Agreement and in the Plan. You hereby agree to
accept as final, conclusive and binding all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Plan or this
Award Agreement.
Appendix I
Notwithstanding any provision in this Award Agreement, if you work or reside outside the U.S., the RSUs shall be subject to the
general non-U.S. terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for your country set forth in Appendix I. Moreover, if you relocate
from the U.S. to one of the countries included in Appendix I or you move between countries included in Appendix I, the general non-U.S.
terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the
application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix I constitutes part of this
Award Agreement.
EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the "Company"), and will learn and have access to the Company's confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me RSUs or other equity grants unless I made such
promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given RSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive's Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company,
to provide information to the government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future
conduct, or engage in any activities protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent rights (the "Applications"). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive's Service, make such
applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the
Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all
rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition,
Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in
the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive
agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future
monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon,
including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to
that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's RSU and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the
Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
APPENDIX I
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the
U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the RSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
January 2018. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the Award Agreement titled "Settlement of Vested RSUs," if you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:
For purposes of the RSU, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section of
the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result
of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:
If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your death
to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another individual
during your lifetime.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:
(a)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights
or compensation.
(b)    In no event should the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
(c)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or salary for any purpose.
(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities authorities in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Language Consent.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that it is your express intent that this Award
Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up
in English.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as
you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) “tipping” third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and acknowledge that you should consult with
your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired upon
vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to
sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company for breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS/NOTIFICATIONS
AUSTRALIA
NOTIFICATIONS
Offer Document.
This offer document sets out information regarding the grant of RSUs to Australian resident employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and is provided by the Company to ensure compliance of the Plan with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's
("ASIC's") Class Order 14/1000 and relevant provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.
In addition to the information set out in the Award Agreement, you also are being provided with a copy of the Plan (the "Additional
Document").
The Additional Document provides further information to help you make an informed investment decision about participating in the Plan. The
Plan is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.
You should not rely upon any oral statements made in relation to this offer. You should rely only upon the statements contained in the Award
Agreement and the Additional Document when considering participation in the Plan.
Securities Law Notification
Investment in Shares involves a degree of risk. If you elect to participate in the Plan, you should monitor your participation and consider all risk
factors relevant to the acquisition of Shares under the Plan as set out in the Award Agreement and the Additional Document.
The information contained in this offer is general information only. It is not advice or information that takes into account your objectives,
financial situation and needs.
You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Plan.
Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business
risks.
More information about potential factors that could affect the Company's business and financial results is included in the Company's most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Copies of these reports are available at
http://www.sec.gov/, on the Company's "Investor Relations" page at http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/, and upon request to the Company.
In addition, you should be aware that the Australian dollar value of any Shares acquired at vesting will be affected by the U.S. dollar/Australian
dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.
Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.
Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.
The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."
The Shares are not liable to any further calls for payment of capital or for other assessment by the Company and have no sinking fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.
Ascertaining the Market Price of Shares
You may ascertain the current market price of the Shares as traded on the Nasdaq at http://www.nasdaq.com under the symbol "KHC." The
Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.
This will not be a prediction of what the market price per Share will be when the RSUs vest or when the Shares are issued or of the applicable
exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.
Deferred Taxation.
Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act, 1997, applies to RSUs granted under the Plan, such that the RSUs are intended to be
subject to deferred taxation.

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of the
Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and RSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs must
be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares are
acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the
Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a
personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.
CHINA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following provisions apply if you are subject to the exchange control regulations or restrictions in the People's Republic of China
("China"), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:
Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Vesting, Termination and Settlement of Vested RSUs sections of the Award Agreement:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force the
sale of any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your
Service, (iii) following your transfer to another Subsidiary or Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company
determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree that you must maintain any Shares acquired under the Plan in an account at a broker
designated by the Company ("Designated Account"). All Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that
Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the termination of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all Shares acquired under the Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such
Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the expiration of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company
in its sole discretion).
You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant to this authorization) and you expressly authorize the Company's designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. You
acknowledge that the Company's designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any
obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items. You agree that if you sell Shares that you acquire under the Plan, the repatriation requirements
described below shall apply.
If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of China,
you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The
Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or advisable to comply
with local regulations.
Exchange Control Restriction.
You understand and agree that, due to exchange control laws in China, you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby consent
and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds from your
participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) is under
no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate, and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due to exchange control
restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your proceeds are delivered to
such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.
You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance
with exchange control requirements in China.
COLOMBIA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Labor Law Acknowledgement . 
You acknowledge that pursuant to Article 15 Law 50/1990 (Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code) the Plan, the RSUs, the underlying
Shares, and any other amounts or payments granted or realized from participation in the Plan do not constitute a component of your “salary” for
any legal purpose. To this extent, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any and all labor benefits, such as
legal/fringe benefits, vacation pay, termination or other indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions or any other labor-related
amount which may be payable.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The Shares are not and will not be registered with the Colombian registry of publicly traded securities (Registro Nacional de Valores y
Emisores) and, therefore, the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing in the Plan, this Award Agreement or any other
document evidencing the grant of the RSUs should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia.
Exchange Control Information.
You are responsible for complying with any and all Colombian foreign exchange restrictions, approvals and reporting requirements in
connection with the RSUs and the Shares you acquire or funds you receive under the Plan.  This may include reporting obligations to the
Central Bank (Banco de la República).  If applicable, you must determine whether you will treat your investments (e.g., the Shares) as (a) a
permanent investment or (b) a temporary investment as follows:
a)Permanent Investment:  If you determine that your investment will be permanent (i.e., because you wish to remain a shareholder), you
will be required to register such investment with the Central Bank, regardless of its value. 
b)Temporary / Financial Investment:  If, on the other hand, you determine that your investment will be temporary (and therefore
considered a “financial investment” under applicable regulations), you will be required to register such investment with the Central

Notifications
Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

Data Privacy Acknowledgment.
You hereby acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms regarding collection, processing and transfer of Data contained in the
Data Privacy Section of the Award Agreement and by participating in the Plan, you agree to such terms. In this regard, upon request of the
Company or your employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form to your employer or the Company (or any other
agreements or consents that may be required by your employer or the Company) that the Company and/or your employer may deem necessary
to obtain under the data privacy laws in your country, either now or in the future. You understand that you will not be able to participate in the
Plan if you fail to execute any such consent or agreement.
U.S. Transaction.
You understand that your acceptance of the RSUs results in a contract between you and the Company that is completed in the United States and
that the Award Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. You
are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the RSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia. In no event will Shares issued upon
vesting of the RSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.
Exchange Control Information.
Under current exchange control regulations, within a reasonably short time after sale of the Shares acquired under the Plan or receipt of
dividends on the Shares, you must repatriate the sale proceeds or dividends to Russia. Such funds must be initially credited to you through a
foreign currency account at an authorized bank in Russia. After the funds are initially received in Russia, they may be further remitted to
foreign banks subject to the following limitations: (i) the foreign account may be opened only for individuals; (ii) the foreign account may not
be used for business activities; and (iii) you must give notice to the Russian tax authorities about the opening/closing of each foreign account
within one month of the account opening/closing. Cash dividends (but not dividend equivalents) and cash income received from the transfer of
funds and/or Shares into the fiduciary/trust management of a non-resident do not need to be remitted to your bank account in Russia but instead
can be remitted directly to a foreign individual bank account (in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") and
Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") countries (such as the United States)). As from January 1, 2018, cash proceeds from the sale of Shares
listed on the Russian stock exchange or a foreign exchange on the legally approved list, also can be paid directly to your foreign bank account
opened with a bank located in an OECD or FATF country.
You are encouraged to contact your personal advisor before remitting your sale proceeds or any dividends to Russia as exchange control
requirements may change and significant penalties apply in the case of non-compliance with the exchange control requirements.
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.
Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should
inform the Company if you are covered by these laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.

Conditions section of this Appendix I:
By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may
be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The
decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise
bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the
RSUs are granted on the assumption and condition that the RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any
employment contract with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes
(including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for
the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be
mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void.
You understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the vesting and settlement of the RSUs is expressly
conditioned on your continuous Service such that if your employment or rendering of Services terminates for any reason whatsoever, your
RSUs will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a
"despido improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause,
material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute,
and/or Article 50 of the Workers' Statute, unilateral withdrawal by your employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the RSUs granted to you that were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones (the "DGCI") of the Ministerio de Economia for statistical purposes. This declaration must be made in January for any Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.
You also are required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any foreign accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.
To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with
a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on your
tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent
years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously reported rights or
assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.
You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

3. Payment.
(a) Form and Time of Payment.
(i) Vesting. The Performance Share Award will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in the Notice provided that you remain
employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Omnibus Plan or this Award
Agreement. Prior to the vesting and settlement of the Performance Share Award, you will not have any rights of a
shareholder with respect to the Performance Share Award or the Shares subject thereto. No Shares will be delivered
pursuant to the vesting of the Performance Share Award unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this
Award Agreement and the Omnibus Plan and (ii) the vesting of the Performance Share Award and the delivery of such
Shares complies with applicable law. Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the
appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have
no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding
the vesting of the Performance Share Award.
(ii) Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, any Performance
Share Award that becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered
in the Participant’s name. In the event the Performance Share Award Share Payout is to be made in Shares results in
less than a whole number of Shares, the Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be rounded up or down to the
next whole Share (no fractional Shares shall be issued in payment of a Performance Share Award). Any Shares issued
in respect of a Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Omnibus Plan and shall reduce the number of Shares available for issuance thereunder.
(iii) Dividends. Any cash dividend the Board declares with respect to the Shares during the Performance Period shall be
treated in accordance with the Notice.
(iv) Payment Timing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21 hereof or in the Notice, as applicable, (A) the
Performance Share Award payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date, but in any event
no later than March 15 of the taxable year following the end of the Performance Period and (B) a Performance Share
Award that becomes payable under Section 3(b)(i), 3(b)(ii), or 3(b)(iii) shall be paid no later than 60 days after the
Vesting Date.
(v) Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If
you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to
such termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause,
subject to anything to the contrary that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your
Service will, at the election of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award
Agreement and the Omnibus Plan, effective as of the date the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any
consequences
following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay gains that
would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
(b) Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) The Performance Share Award shall not become payable to the Participant or his or her legal representative unless and
until the Participant or his or her legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-
Related Items (as defined in Section 5 below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
(ii) The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to
the fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on
which the Shares are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any
state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or
other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary and
advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the
Shares would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or
other clearance from any state, federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (D) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the
date the Performance Share Award becomes payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of
administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for full or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of a Participant’s active employment for
any reason prior to the completion of a Performance Period to which a Performance Share Award relates; provided that the
Committee shall not exercise such discretion if doing so would cause other Performance Share Awards that are intended to
qualify as Qualified Performance-Based Compensation not to qualify.
4.Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or
all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in
the Omnibus Plan and legally applicable to the Participant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate
liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount
actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Furthermore, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer
(a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the
Performance Share Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award or the
subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to
structure the terms of the grant of the Performance Share Award or any aspect of the Participant’s participation in the Omnibus Plan to
reduce or eliminate his or her liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. If the Participant becomes subject to
Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event,
as applicable, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be
required to withhold or account for (including report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of
the Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the number
of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from a Performance Share Award Share Payout
or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by withholding a number of
Shares as described
herein, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to the Participant at vesting,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.
The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting or payment of
this Performance Share Award, the sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award or hypothetical withholding tax amounts if
the Participant is covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts from any
proceeds realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by the Participant. Such
open-market sale is on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be,
by withholding from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
If the Participant is subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, the Participant may elect the form of withholding
in advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the number
of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the Performance Share Award Share
Payout, or the Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.
Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at
the Fair Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount giving rise
to the withholding requirement first became includible in the gross income of the Participant under applicable tax laws. The Company may
refuse to issue or deliver the Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her Tax-Related Items obligations. To avoid negative
accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding
amounts or other applicable withholding rates.
The Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be
required to withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If the Participant is covered by a Company tax equalization
policy, the Participant also agrees to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and
conditions of such tax equalization policy.
5.Nature of Grant. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, the Participant
acknowledges, understands and agrees that:
(a) the Omnibus Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,
suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Omnibus Plan;
(b) the grant of the Performance Share Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future grants of Performance Share Awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Awards, even if Performance Share Awards have
been granted repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future Performance Share Award grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Committee;
(d) the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Omnibus Plan;
(e) the Performance Share Award and any Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of or included in any
calculation of severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension,
retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past
services for the Company, the Employer, or any Affiliate;
(f) the Performance Share Award grant shall not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship with
the Company or any Affiliate;
(g) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h) the Performance Share Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement, not otherwise
specifically determined by the Company in its discretion, to have the Performance Share Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed
by, another company, or to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
(i) for Participants who reside outside the U.S., the following additional provisions shall apply:
(j) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not intended to replace any
pension rights or compensation;
(k) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are extraordinary items that do not
constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and are outside the scope of the
Participant’s employment or service contract, if any;
(l) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of normal compensation
or salary from the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the
Company, the Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;
(m) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Share Award resulting
from failure to reach Performance Goals or termination of the Participant’s employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country where the Participant resides or later found to be invalid), and
in consideration of the grant of the Performance Share Award to which the Participant is otherwise not entitled, the Participant irrevocably
agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases
the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and
agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims; and
(n) neither the Company, the Employer nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the
Participant’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Share Award, any Shares paid to the
Participant or any proceeds resulting from the Participant’s sale of such Shares.
6. Data Privacy. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, the Participant
hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant’s personal
data as described in this Agreement and any other Performance Share Award grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer,
the Company and its Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s receipt of the
Performance Share Award.
The Participant understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Participant,
including, but not limited to, the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance

The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to UBS Financial Services (“UBS”), or such other stock plan service
provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and
management of the Performance Share Award. The Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United
States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the
Participant’s country. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may request a list with
the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. The
Participant authorizes the Company, UBS and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with
implementing, administering and managing the Performance Share Award to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in
electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Performance
Share Award. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage
the Participant’s receipt of the Performance Share Award. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands

Participant’s ability to receive the Performance Share Award. For more information on the consequences of the Participant’s refusal to
consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.

in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise
pledged and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon
the levy of any such process, in violation of the provisions herein, the Performance Share Award shall immediately become null and
void and any rights to receive a payment under the Performance Share Award shall be forfeited.
8. Rights as Shareholder. Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any of the rights or
privileges of a shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares
(which may be in uncertificated form) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or
registrars, and delivered to the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and
delivery, the Participant shall have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the Shares and the
right to receive any cash or Share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.
9. Repayment/Forfeiture. The Award shall be canceled and forfeited, if, without the consent of the Company, while employed by or
providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary or after termination of such employment or service, Participant (i) violates a non-
competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement, (ii) otherwise engages in activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the
interest of the Company or any Subsidiary, including fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, as determined
by the Committee in its sole discretion. In addition, any payments or benefits the Participant may receive hereunder shall be subject to
repayment or forfeiture as may be required to comply with the requirements under the Securities Act, the Act, rules promulgated by the
Commission or any other applicable law, including the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or

you should have received under the terms of the Performance Share Award for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial
restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error), all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay
any such excess amount to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the non-disclosure restrictions in this Agreement shall, or
shall be interpreted to, impair the Participant from exercising any legally protected whistleblower rights (including under Rule 21F under the
Act).
10. Restrictions on Resale. The Participant hereby agrees not to sell any Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award at a

Performance Share Award and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.
13. Securities Laws and Clawback. By accepting a Performance Share Award, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign
securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares, including,

including fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or
to the extent that you otherwise violate any policy adopted by the Company relating to the recovery of compensation granted, paid, delivered,
awarded or otherwise provided to you by the Company as such policy is in effect on the date of grant of the applicable Award or, to the extent
necessary to address the requirements of applicable law (including Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the "Company"), and will learn and have access to the Company's confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other
equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given PSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive's Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any
representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the
extent permitted by law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the
Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers
who, during the two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or
with which the Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had
access to confidential information by virtue of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent rights (the "Applications"). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive's Service, make such
applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the
Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all
rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be
assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive
hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to
that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Omnibus Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof
(as such terms are defined in the Omnibus Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms
of the Omnibus Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the
Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
APPENDIX I
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the PSUs granted to you under the Omnibus Plan if you work or reside
outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the
terms and conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set
forth in the Omnibus Plan and/or the Award Agreement.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another country after the PSUs are granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the terms and
conditions contained herein may not be applicable to you, and the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.
NOTIFICATIONS
This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Omnibus Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective
countries as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not
rely on the information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Omnibus
Plan because the information may be out of date at the time you vest in the PSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or
residency after the PSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.
Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:
If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the PSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the PSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Omnibus Plan
and the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the PSUs.
Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the PSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the PSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination.
The following provisions supplement the termination of services provisions of the Award Notice and Agreement, provided, however, that if you
are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the PSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your
Separation from Service:
For purposes of the PSU, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
PSU under the Omnibus Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service
would not include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the
jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion
to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the PSUs upon termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Notice and
Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a particular
jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement being
deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you cease
to provide Service and the PSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Award Agreement and Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).
If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you may receive a
refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is
satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Omnibus Plan.
Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Nature of Grant section of the Award Agreement:
You acknowledge the following with respect to the PSUs:
(a)    The PSUs, any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any
pension rights or compensation.
(b)    In no event should the PSUs, any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
(c)    The PSU, any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected
compensation or salary for any purpose.
(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your
local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the PSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the PSUs
or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the PSUs under the Omnibus Plan nor the issuance of the
underlying Shares upon vesting of the PSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of
employment, if different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities
authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Language Consent.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that it is your express intent that this Award
Agreement, the Omnibus Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the PSUs, be
drawn up in English.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
Depending on your country, you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws, which may affect your ability to
acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares under the Omnibus Plan during such times as you are considered to have "inside information"
regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in your country). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in
addition to any restrictions that may be imposed
under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions,
and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Omnibus Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of
your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to
the applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
No Advice Regarding Award.
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your
participation in the Omnibus Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You are hereby advised to consult with your own
personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Omnibus Plan before taking any action related to the Omnibus
Plan.
Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Omnibus Plan, on the PSUs and on any Shares issued
upon vesting of the PSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require
you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company or breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Omnibus Plan, if any,
provided the sale of the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e.,
NASDAQ).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any foreign property (including Shares and PSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification
Statement) if the total cost of your foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by April 30 of the
following year. Foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and may include the PSUs. The PSUs must be reported -
generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares are acquired, their cost
generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the Shares at vesting, but if
you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a personal tax advisor to
determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

entitlement to shares awarded, cancelled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding ("Data") for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Omnibus Plan. You are aware that providing the Company with your Data is
necessary for the performance of the Award Agreement and that your refusal to provide such Data would make it impossible for the
Company to perform its contractual obligations and may affect your ability to participate in the Omnibus Plan.
The Controller of personal Data processing is The Kraft Heinz Company, One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, U.S.A. Heinz
Italia S.p.A., is the Company's Representative for privacy purposes pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003. You understand that the

conditions of the Omnibus Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any inconsistency between
the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Omnibus Plan shall control.

Company covering you or (ii) in the absence of any such policy, a physical or mental condition rendering you unable to

(b) “Employment Agreement” means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including an offer letter.

3.Payment.
(a) Form and Time of Payment.
(i) Vesting. The Performance Share Award will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in the Notice subject to your continued
Service with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Omnibus Plan or this
Agreement. Prior to the vesting and settlement of the Performance Share Award, you will not have any rights of a
shareholder with respect to the Performance Share Award or the Shares subject thereto. No Shares will be delivered
pursuant to the vesting of the Performance Share Award unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this
Agreement and the Omnibus Plan and (ii) the vesting of the Performance Share Award and the delivery of such Shares
complies with applicable law. Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry
on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or
receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the
Performance Share Award.
(ii) Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, any Performance
Share Award that becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered
in your name. In the event the
Performance Share Award Share Payout is to be made in Shares results in less than a whole number of Shares, the
Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be rounded up or down to the next whole Share (no fractional Shares
shall be issued in payment of a Performance Share Award). Any Shares issued in respect of a Performance Share Award
Share Payout shall be issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Plan and shall reduce the number of
Shares available for issuance thereunder.
(iii) Dividends. Any cash dividend the Board declares with respect to the Shares during the Performance Period shall be
treated in accordance with the Notice.
(iv) Payment Timing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21 hereof or in the Notice, as applicable, (A) the
Performance Share Award payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date, but in any event
no later than March 15 of the taxable year following such date and (B) a Performance Share Award that becomes
payable due to a termination Without Cause, or termination due to your Retirement, death or Disability, shall be paid no
later than 60 days after the Vesting Date.
(v) Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If
you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to
such termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause,
subject to anything to the contrary that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your
Service will, at the election of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this
Agreement and the Omnibus Plan, effective as of the date the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any
consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay
gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).
(b) Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) The Performance Share Award shall not become payable to you or your legal representative unless and until you or
your legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in
Section 5 below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
(ii) The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to
the fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on
which the Shares are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any
state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission”) or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion,
deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not
so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares would be exempt from any such
registration or qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state, federal or
foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable
and (D) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the Performance Share Award becomes
payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience, subject to
compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for full or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of your active employment for any reason
prior to the completion of a Performance Period to which a Performance Share Award relates; provided that the Committee
shall not exercise such discretion if doing so would cause other Performance Share Awards that are intended to qualify as
Qualified Performance-Based Compensation not to qualify.
4.Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any
or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the
Omnibus Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related
Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or
the Employer. Furthermore, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings
regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Award, including, but not
limited to, the grant, vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the
Performance Share Award; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant of the Performance
Share Award or any aspect of your participation in the Omnibus Plan to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. If you are or become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge
that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for (including
report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of
the Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the
number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from a Performance Share
Award Share Payout or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by
withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of
Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items
withholding.
The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting or payment of
this Performance Share Award, the sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award or hypothetical withholding tax
amounts if you are covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts
from any proceeds realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by
you. Such open-market sale is on your behalf and at your direction pursuant to this authorization.
Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case
may be, by withholding from your wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer.
If you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, the Participant may elect the form of withholding in
advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the
number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the Performance Share
Award Share Payout, or the Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.
Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at
the Fair Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount
giving rise to the withholding requirement first became includible in your gross income under applicable tax laws. The Company may
refuse to issue or deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your Tax-Related Items obligations. Depending on the withholding
method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding
amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s).
You shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to
withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If you are covered by a Company tax equalization policy, you also
agrees to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and conditions of such tax
equalization policy.
5.Nature of Grant. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, you acknowledge,
understand and agree that:
(a) the Omnibus Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,
suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Omnibus Plan;
(b) the grant of the Performance Share Award is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other
right to receive future grants of Performance Share Awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Awards, even if
Performance Share Awards have been granted in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to future Performance Share Award grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Committee;
(d) the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Omnibus Plan;
(e) the Performance Share Award and any Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of or included in any
calculation of severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension, retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for,
or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer, or any Affiliate;
(f) the Performance Share Award grant shall not be interpreted to form or amend an employment or service contract or relationship
with the Company or any Affiliate;
(g) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(h) the Performance Share Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement, not otherwise
specifically determined by the Company in its discretion, to have the Performance Share Award or any such benefits
transferred to, or assumed by, another company, or to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any
corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
If you reside outside the U.S., the following additional provisions shall apply:
(i) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award, and the income from and value of same,
are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
(j) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are extraordinary items that do not
constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and are outside the
scope of your employment or service contract, if any;
(k) the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of normal compensation or
salary from the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for
the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;
(l) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Share Award resulting from
failure to reach Performance Goals or termination of your employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country where you reside or later found to be invalid),
and in consideration of the grant of the Performance Share Award to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably
agree never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waive your ability, if any, to
bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Omnibus Plan, you shall be deemed
irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal
or withdrawal of such claims; and
(m) neither the Company, the Employer nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your
local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Share Award, any Shares paid to you
or any proceeds resulting from your sale of such Shares.
6.Data Privacy. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, you hereby
explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as
described in this Agreement and any other Performance Share Award grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer,
the Company and its Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your receipt of the
Performance Share Award.
You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited
to, your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance Share
Awards or any other entitlement to Shares of stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or
outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in
the Omnibus Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to UBS Financial Services (“UBS”), or such other stock plan service provider as may
be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and
management of the Performance Share Award. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States
or elsewhere, and that the recipients' country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than
your country. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of
any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, UBS and
any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and
managing the Performance Share Award to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the
sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Performance Share Award. You understand
that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your receipt of the Performance Share
Award. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information
about the storage and processing of Data, require any
necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your
local human resources representative. You understand, that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to participate in
the Omnibus Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not
consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be affected; the only consequence of
refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Performance Share Award or other
Awards to you or administer or maintain such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.
Upon request of the Company or the Employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form (or any other
agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or the Employer) that the Company and/or the Employer may
deem necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Omnibus Plan in compliance with the
data privacy laws in your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree
that you will be unable to participate in the Omnibus Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the
Company and/or the Employer.
7.Nontransferability of Performance Share Award. The Performance Share Award or the interests or rights therein may not be transferred
in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise
pledged and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon
the levy of any such process, in violation of the provisions herein, the Performance Share Award shall immediately become null and
void and any rights to receive a payment under the Performance Share Award shall be forfeited.
8.Rights as Shareholder. Neither you nor any person claiming under or through you shall have any of the rights or privileges of a
shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which
may be in uncertificated form) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or
registrars, and delivered to you (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and
delivery, you shall have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the Shares and the
right to receive any cash or Share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.
9.Repayment/Forfeiture. The Award shall be canceled and forfeited, if, without the consent of the Company, while employed by or
providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary or after termination of such employment or service, you (i) violate a non-
competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant or agreement, (ii) otherwise engage in activity that is in conflict with or
adverse to the interest of the Company or any Subsidiary, including fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or
irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In addition, any payments or benefits you may receive
hereunder shall be subject to repayment or forfeiture as may be required to comply with the requirements under the Securities Act, the
Act, rules promulgated by the Commission or any other applicable law, including the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded, as may be in effect from
time to time as well as any policy relating to the repayment or forfeiture of compensation that the Company may adopt from time-to-
time. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms of the Performance Share Award

directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or
(ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made under seal.

EXHIBIT B
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT
I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its Affiliates (collectively the "Company"), and will learn and have access to the Company's confidential, trade secret and proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other
equity grants unless I made such promises.
In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given PSUs or other equity grants in exchange for my
agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:
1.NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all data, information, ideas, concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during the period of Executive's Service or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's
Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence either directly or indirectly to a Federal, State, or local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade secrets in a complaint, or other document, filed in a lawsuit, or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Finally, if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
No Company policies or practices, including this Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information provision, is intended to or shall limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company, to provide information to the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.
2.NON-COMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the Company in the consumer packaged food and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%)
of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive
has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
3.NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.
4.NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Company or hire or retain any such
employee, representative or agent, or take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with a Company employee relating to possible employment, (ii)
offering bonuses or other compensation to encourage a Company employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.
5.NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Executive agrees not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company or its officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.
6.INVENTIONS.
a.Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software, know-how, processes, techniques, methods, works of authorship and other work product ("Inventions"), whether
patentable or unpatentable, (A) that are reduced to practice, created, invented, designed, developed, contributed to, or improved
with the use of any Company resources and/or within the scope of Executive's work with the Company or that relate to the
business, operations or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company, and that are made or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any work that Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent rights (the "Applications"). Executive will, at any time during and subsequent to Executive's Service, make such
applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all other acts as may be requested from time to time by the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company, but entirely at the
Company's expense.
b.In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise
automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights, in all
media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without
limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) to the
Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including, without
limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to
exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct in
derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be
assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive
hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents and other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.
7.RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).
8.REASONABLENESS OF COVENANTS. In signing this Agreement, including by electronic means, Executive gives the Company
assurance that Executive has carefully read and considered all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints
imposed by it. Executive agrees that these restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and
geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the
Company's Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all
of Executive's obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction
on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.
9.REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.
10.REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the
provisions of Agreement would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available, without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages, in addition to any other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.
11.REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Omnibus Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof
(as such terms are defined in the Omnibus Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms
of the Omnibus Plan.
12.TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.
13.SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Agreement hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of the
Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
14.VENUE, PERSONAL JURISDICTION, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE. Executive expressly agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation
to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company.
Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this
Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction
or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further
irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a
court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this
Agreement, and any disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the
application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the PSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or your country of employment, if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the PSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Agreement shall give the Company the
authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
Termination Without Cause, death and Disability / Payout Upon Termination.
The following provisions supplement the termination provisions of the Award Notice and Agreement, provided, however, that if you are subject
to U.S. federal income tax and the PSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation
from Service:
For purposes of the PSU, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the PSU
under the Omnibus Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would
not include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).
Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the PSUs upon termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Notice and
Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a particular
jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Agreement being deemed
unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you cease to
provide Service and the PSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.
Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Agreement and Omnibus Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the PSUs under the Omnibus Plan nor the issuance of the
underlying Shares upon vesting of the PSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of
employment, if different). The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings to the local securities
authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.
Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the Shares are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker's country, if different, which may affect your ability to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Omnibus Plan during such
times as you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local
insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) "tipping" third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends, dividend equivalents and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your
participation in the Omnibus Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of
your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to
the applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS/NOTIFICATIONS
AUSTRALIA
NOTIFICATIONS
Offer Document.
This offer document sets out information regarding the grant of PSUs to Australian resident employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and is provided by the Company to ensure compliance of the Omnibus Plan with the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission's ("ASIC's") Class Order 14/1000 and relevant provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.
In addition to the information set out in the Agreement, you also are being provided with a copy of the Omnibus Plan, the prospectus and the
employee information supplement (collectively, the "Additional Documents").
The Additional Documents provide further information to help you make an informed investment decision about participating in the Omnibus
Plan. The Omnibus Plan is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.
You should not rely upon any oral statements made in relation to this offer. You should rely only upon the statements contained in the
Agreement and the Additional Documents when considering participation in the Omnibus Plan.
Securities Law Notification
Investment in Shares involves a degree of risk. If you elect to participate in the Omnibus Plan, you should monitor your participation and
consider all risk factors relevant to the acquisition of Shares under the Omnibus Plan as set out in the Agreement and the Additional
Documents.
The information contained in this offer is general information only. It is not advice or information that takes into account your objectives,
financial situation and needs.
You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Omnibus Plan.
Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business
risks.
More information about potential factors that could affect the Company's business and financial results is included in the Company's most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Copies of these reports are available at
http://www.sec.gov/, on the Company's "Investor Relations" page at http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/, and upon request to the Company.
In addition, you should be aware that the Australian dollar value of any Shares acquired at vesting will be affected by the U.S. dollar/Australian
dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Omnibus Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.
Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.
Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.
The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."
The Shares are not liable to any further calls for payment of capital or for other assessment by the Company and have no sinking fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.
Ascertaining the Market Price of Shares
You may ascertain the current market price of the Shares as traded on the Nasdaq at http://www.Nasdaq.com under the symbol "KHC." The
Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.
This will not be a prediction of what the market price per Share will be when the PSUs vest or when the Shares are issued or of the applicable
exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.
Deferred Taxation.
Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act, 1997, applies to PSUs granted under the Omnibus Plan, such that the PSUs are
intended to be subject to deferred taxation.
BRAZIL
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Compliance with Law.
By accepting the PSUs you acknowledge that you agree to comply with applicable Brazilian laws and pay any and all applicable taxes legally
due by you associated with the vesting of the PSUs, the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalents, and the sale of Shares acquired
or issued under the Omnibus Plan. You further agree that, for all legal purposes, (i) the benefits provided to you under the Omnibus Plan are the
result of commercial transactions unrelated to your employment or Service relationship, (ii) the Omnibus Plan is not a part of the terms and
conditions of your employment or Service relationship, and (iii) the income from the Award, if any, is not part of your remuneration from
employment or Service.
NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
If you are resident or domiciled in Brazil, you will be required to submit annually a declaration of assets and rights held outside of Brazil to the
Central Bank of Brazil if the aggregate value of such assets and rights is equal to or greater than US$100,000. Assets and rights that must be
reported include Shares.
CANADA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Plan Document Acknowledgment.
In accepting the grant of PSUs, you acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Omnibus Plan, have reviewed the Omnibus Plan and the
Agreement in their entirety and fully understand and accept all provisions of the Omnibus Plan and the Agreement.
Payout of PSUs in Shares Only.
Pursuant to its discretion under Section 10(d) of the Omnibus Plan, with respect to all employees residing in Canada, the Company will convert
all vested PSUs only into an equivalent number of Shares. If you reside in Canada (or in the event of your death, your legal representative or
estate) you will not receive an equivalent or fractional Share cash
payment with respect to the vested PSUs.
Termination.
The following provision replaces the first paragraph of the Termination section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this
Appendix I:
In the event of your termination of Service (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where
you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), unless provided otherwise by the Company: (i) your right to vest in
the PSUs (if any) will terminate effective, as of the earlier of (1) the date the you receive notice of termination, or (2) the date you are no longer
actively providing Service, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under applicable Canadian
employment laws (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law).
The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs
(including whether you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).
The following terms and conditions apply if you are a resident of Quebec:
Data Privacy.
This provision supplements the Data Privacy section of the Agreement:
You hereby authorize the Company and the Company's representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel,
professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Omnibus Plan. You further authorize the Company and any Subsidiary
or Affiliate and the administrator of the Omnibus Plan to disclose and discuss the Omnibus Plan with their advisors. You further authorize the
Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in your employee file.
Language Consent.
The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Agreement, as well as all documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into,
given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
Consentement relatif à la langue.
Les parties reconnaissent avoir expressément exigé la rédaction en anglais de la Convention d'Attribution, ainsi que de tous documents, avis et
procédures judiciaires, exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement à, la présente convention.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Omnibus Plan, if any,
provided the sale of the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e.,
Nasdaq).
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian residents are required to report any specified foreign property (including Shares and PSUs) on form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and may include the PSUs. The
PSUs must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If
Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value
of the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other
shares. You should speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this
requirement.
CHINA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following provisions apply if you are subject to the exchange control regulations or restrictions in the People's Republic of China
("China"), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:
Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Payment section of the Agreement:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force the sale of
any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your Service, (iii) following your transfer to another Subsidiary or
Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree that you must
maintain any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan in an account at a broker designated by the Company ("Designated Account"). All
Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the termination
of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all Shares acquired
under the Omnibus Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the expiration
of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).
You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant to this authorization) and you expressly authorize the Company's designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. You
acknowledge that the Company's designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any
obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items. You agree that if you sell Shares that you acquire under the Omnibus Plan, the repatriation
requirements described below shall apply.
If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of China,
you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The
Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Omnibus Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or advisable
to comply with local regulations.
Exchange Control Restriction.
You understand and agree that, due to exchange control laws in China, you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash
proceeds acquired under the Omnibus Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be
effected through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby
consent and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds
from your participation in the Omnibus Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) is under no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate, and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due
to exchange control restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your
proceeds are delivered to such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.
You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance
with exchange control requirements in China.
COLOMBIA
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Labor Law Acknowledgment. 
You acknowledge that pursuant to Article 15 Law 50/1990 (Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code) the Omnibus Plan, the PSUs, the
underlying Shares, and any other amounts or payments granted or realized from participation in the Omnibus Plan do not constitute a
component of your “salary” for any legal purpose. To this extent, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any
and all labor benefits, such as legal/fringe benefits, vacation pay, termination or other indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions
or any other labor-related amount which may be payable.
NOTIFICATIONS
Securities Law Information.
The Shares are not and will not be registered with the Colombian registry of publicly traded securities (Registro Nacional de Valores y
Emisores) and, therefore, the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing in the Omnibus Plan, the Agreement or any other
document evidencing the grant of the PSUs should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia.
Exchange Control Information.
You are responsible for complying with any and all Colombian foreign exchange restrictions, approvals and reporting requirements in
connection with the PSUs and the Shares you acquire or funds you receive under the Omnibus Plan.  This may include reporting obligations to
the Central Bank (Banco de la República).  If applicable, you must determine whether you will treat your investments (e.g., the Shares) as (a) a
permanent investment or (b) a temporary investment as follows:
a)Permanent Investment:  If you determine that your investment will be permanent (i.e., because you wish to remain a shareholder), you
will be required to register such investment with the Central Bank, regardless of its value. 
b)Temporary / Financial Investment:  If, on the other hand, you determine that your investment will be temporary (and therefore
considered a “financial investment” under applicable regulations), you will be required to register such investment with the Central
Bank only if the aggregate value of the investment (as of December 31 for each year) is equal to or greater than US$500,000.
In either case, you must file the Central Bank’s Form 11.  Colombian law does not provide specific criteria to differentiate between treatment as
a permanent investment or temporary / financial investment.  You should consult with your personal or legal advisor regarding any obligations
that you may have as a result of participating in the Omnibus Plan.
COSTA RICA
There are no country-specific provisions.
INDONESIA
NOTIFICATIONS
Exchange Control Information.
Indonesian residents must provide the Bank of Indonesia with information on foreign exchange activities in an online monthly report no later
than the fifteenth day of the month following the activity. In addition, if you remit funds into Indonesia (e.g., proceeds from the sale of Shares),
the Indonesian bank through which the transaction is made will submit a report of the transaction to the Bank of Indonesia for statistical
reporting purposes. For transactions of US$10,000 or more, a more detailed description of the transaction must be included in the report and
you may be required
to provide information about the transaction (e.g., the relationship between you and the transferor of the funds, the source of the funds, etc.) to
the bank in order for the bank to complete the report.

unvested or outstanding ("Data") for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Omnibus Plan.
You are aware that providing the Company with your Data is necessary for the performance of the Agreement and that your refusal to
provide such Data would make it impossible for the Company to perform its contractual obligations and may affect your ability to

processing activity, including the transfer of your Data abroad, outside of the European Union, as herein specified and pursuant to

under automated or non-automated conditions, anonymously when possible, that comply with the purposes for which Data is collected and
with confidentiality and security provisions as set forth by applicable Italian data privacy laws and regulations, with specific reference to
D.lgs. 196/2003.

or complaints can be addressed by contacting your local human resources representative.

(iii) Repayment/Forfeiture; (iv) Withholding Taxes; (v) No Guarantee of Continued Employment; (vi) Nature of Grant; (vii) Entire
Agreement/Governing Law; and (viii) the terms and conditions set forth immediately above in this section of Appendix I for Italy.
NOTIFICATIONS
Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Italian residents who, during the fiscal year, hold investments abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and PSUs) which may
generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no
tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or foreign
financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and PSUs), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering provisions.
Tax on Foreign Financial Assets.
Italian residents may be subject to tax on the value of financial assets held outside of Italy. The taxable amount will be the fair market value of
the financial assets, including Shares assessed at the end of the calendar year. If you are subject to this foreign financial assets tax, you will
need to report the value of your financial assets held abroad in your annual tax return. You are encouraged to consult your personal legal
advisor for additional information about the foreign financial assets tax.
JAPAN

NEW ZEALAND
Notifications
Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered PSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the PSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.
If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.
New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme. As a result, you may not be given all the information usually required. You will also have fewer other legal protections for this
investment.
In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).
Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

(Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.) ("SFA"), under which it is exempt from the prospectus and registration requirements under the SFA. The Omnibus
Plan has not been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the grant of the PSUs is not made with a
view to the PSUs or Shares being subsequently offered to another party. You should note that the PSUs are subject to section 257 of the SFA
and you should not make any subsequent sale of Shares in Singapore or any offer of such subsequent sale of Shares subject to the awards in
Singapore, unless such sale or offer in is made: (i) more than six (6) months from the Grant Date or (ii) pursuant to the exemptions under Part
XIII Division (1) Subdivision (4) (other than section 280) of the SFA.
Chief Executive Officer/Director Notification Requirement.
If you are the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), a director, associate director or shadow director of the Company's Singapore Subsidiary or
Affiliate, you are subject to certain notification requirements under the Singapore Companies Act. Among these requirements is an obligation
to notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate in writing when you receive an interest (e.g., PSUs, Shares) in the Company, a Subsidiary or
Affiliate. In addition, you must notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate when you sell Shares (including when you sell Shares issued upon
vesting and settlement of the PSUs). These notifications must be made within two (2) business days of acquiring or disposing of any interest in
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition, a notification of your interests in the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate must be made
within two (2) business days of becoming CEO or a director.
