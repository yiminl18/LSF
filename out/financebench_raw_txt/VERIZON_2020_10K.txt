Competition and Related Trends
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. W e expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
With respect to our wireles s connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless  service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc.,
as well as various regional  wireless service providers . We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers,
including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others. Com petition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone
penetration in the wireless market, increased network  investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, the introduction of
new products and services,  offerings that include additional bundled premium content, new market entran ts, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum
and regulatory changes. Competition may also incre ase as smaller , stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless
service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services. In addition, DISH Network has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in
each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result in additional competitive pressures in the U.S.
wireless industry .
We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to
the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and
others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice service, as well as alternative
means of accessing video content.
With respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers,
satellite television companies, internet service provid ers, over-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with
wireless servi ces through strategic relationships. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services. We expect the
market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We expect customer migration  from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as
a growing number of custo mers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition
from cable operators and other providers of V oIP services as well as internet portal providers.
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry:
• Network reliability , speed and coverage.  We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality , fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the
market and driver of custom er satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerin gs, which in many cases include video content, have led
to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity
usage requirements and of fer highly reliable national coverage.
• Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless
services continues to grow , wireless service provide rs are offering a range of service plans at competitiv e prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle
wireless service of ferings with other content and of fer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be tar geted specifically to customers of V erizon. W e
and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their
device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an
effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. Pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional
service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of
providing wireline communication services emer ge, new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing. For example, VoIP
and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues.
• Customer service. We believe that high-quali ty customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other
providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and
focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn.
Customer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers with ready access to their
system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small
and Medium Business customers through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business customers.
For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives.
• Product differ entiation.  Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services, as the delivery
of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage
their broadband, video and wireless connections. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously review , improve and refine their product portfolio and
develop and rapidly
7
Table of Contents
deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative
products and services, both independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers. Features such as wireless
and wireline inter -operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
• Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of
sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services,
outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of
wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users.
In addition to these competitive factors and trends, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number
of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale
market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enter prises and government customers. Many of these companies have
strong market  presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.
In the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a
consumer -like "look and feel" are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cyc le offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing
their businesses. Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology conver gence.
We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies
are making strategic acquis itions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused
on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, softwa re defined networking, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of
in-house machines.
Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for
wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity .
Verizon Media
Our media business, Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), includes diverse media and technology brands that serve both consumers and businesses. Verizon Media
provides consumers with owned and operated and third-party search properties as well as mail, news,  finance, sports and entertainment offerings, and provides other

Verizon Media Platform
As the digital  platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for stable, high-quality video delivery platforms. Our Media
Platform of fers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites to our customers on their devices at any
time. This platform is tar geted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses that deliver their digital products and services through the internet.
Global Network and Technology
Our global network architecture is used by Consumer , Business and V erizon Media. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies.
Network Evolution
We are evolving the architecture of our networks to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and
opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access netw ork technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We
expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new
opportunities in the business market in a cost ef ficient manner .
5G Deployment
Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry  standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless
services. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current fourth-generation (4G) (LTE) technology and enable our networks
to handle more traffic as the number of internet-conne cted devices grows. As of December 31, 2020, we have launched our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in 61 U.S. markets.
We have commercially launched 5G Home in 12 of those markets.
We also launched our 5G Nationwide Network in October 2020, which is available in over 2,700 cities  across the U.S. covering approximately 230 million people. 5G
Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology , which allows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple
spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’ s high-band Ultra Wideband cover age area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology
using the lower spectrum bands where the 5G Nationwide network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve
both 4G and 5G customers.
4G LTE
The wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE, which  provides higher data throughput performance for data services at
a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technology . As of December 31, 2020, our 4G LTE network is available in over 700 markets covering approximately 327
million peopl e, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build
and operate a 4G LTE netw ork using each carrier ’s network assets with our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) spectrum. In 2020, we launched L TE Home Internet, a home broadband internet service that leverages the V erizon 4G L TE network.
Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out
We consider the reliability , coverage and speed of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success. We believe that steady and consistent network and
platform investments provide the foundation for innov ative products and services. As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions
the network enables, delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped.
We utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and
putting additional wireless spectrum into service.
We have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add
capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing
existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to
increase both network capacity and data rates.
In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must complete a variety of steps, which can include securing rights to a large
number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities, for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and
related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that
support our wireless network operations. W e utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites.
Our networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers. To mitigate the impact of
power disrupt ions on our operations, we have battery  backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at
every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup
9
Table of Contents
generators that can be deployed, if needed. W e further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service  providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in
nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of interna tional wireless voice and data services to our customers through
roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the U.S.
Fios
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow . We expect
the continued emer gence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for
increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-
effective and ef ficient manner .
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as
businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
Global IP
Verizon owns and operates  one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectiv ity to Business customers in more than 180 countries. Our global
IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations.
Global busine ss is rapidly evolving to an "everything -as-a-service" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions delivered securely
via managed and professional services. W e are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand.
Spectrum
The spectrum  licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice, video and data communicati ons services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal
Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively ,
cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. We have also deployed 4G technologies in 3.5 Gigahert z (GHz) shared spectrum, using LTE/Citizens Broadband Radio
Service, and in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are using our
low and mid- band spectrum to provide 3G, 4G LTE and 5G wireless services. We are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE
service. We are also utiliz ing low and mid-band spectrum, through DSS, for 5G to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 GHz band, collectively called
millimeter wave spectrum.
Millimeter wave and low and mid-band spectrum are being used for our 5G technology deployment. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future
demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require
faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deploymen t of 5G mobile and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing
spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur .
From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue
similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum
swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and
efficiency . These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.
Information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries.
Human Capital Resources
At Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to realize our core business strategy , we have developed human capital programs and
practices that support, develop and care for our employees from the time they join our team through the entirety of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered
on the following principles:
• Attract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce that has a capacity for learning and brings high-value skills and expertise to the Company .
• Develop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional development experiences, creating a culture of
continuous learning and engagement.
10
Table of Contents
• Inspire indivi duals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and upskilling opportun ities and establishing an inspiring and inclusive work
environment for all.
Verizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 132,200 employees measured on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2020, we know
that we need employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to help us understand and connect more meaningfully to the diverse customers and
communities we serve. Our human capital programs and practices are designed to create a workplace where employees are empowered to share their authentic selves and
feel seen and heard as vital contributors to Verizon’ s corporate purpose. In addition, Verizon has extensive on-the-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs
and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professio nally . Guided by our long-standing commitment to diversity and
inclusion, our hiring and outreach programs have resulted in a strong representation of women and peopl e of color . As of December 31, 2020, Verizon's global workforce
was approximately 66.2% male, 33.7% female and 0.1% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity  of our U.S. workforce was 53.9% White, 19.3% Black, 11.3%
Hispanic, 9.4% Asian, 0.4%  American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander , 2.5% two or more races, and 2.9% unknown or undeclared. Women
represented 37.9% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented 34.6% of U.S. senior leadership.
Verizon respe cts our employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable law, including the right to join or not join labor
unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—the two unions that in
total represent approximately 22.5% of our employee s as of December 31, 2020. In addition, where applic able outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative
bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics,
including safety , customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having
on our customers, employees and business strategy .
In 2020, Verizon employee s across the Company came together in new ways in response to the health and humanitarian crisis brought on by the novel coronavirus (COVID-
19) pandemic. Soon after COVID-19 was first identi fied, Verizon took many broad-ranging steps to supp ort our employees and their families so that the Company could
continue providing our essential services to our custo mers and communities. Some of these measures inclu ded temporarily moving over 115,000 of our employees to remote
work arrangements and temporarily closing nearly 70% of our Company-owned retail store locations or moving to appointment-only store access; limiting our customer -
focused field operations for a period of time; enhanc ing safety protocols for employees working outside their homes; launching a COVID-19 leave of absence policy and
expanded family care assis tance for employees; and providing additional compensation to employees in front line roles that could not be done from home for a period of
time. In an effort to foster transparency and provide support during this unprecedented time, Verizon launched a daily live webcast with current information on the
Company’ s actions to address the impacts of COVID-19 as well as a number of broad ranging resources for employees. In addition, Verizon re-trained over 20,000 frontline
employees to temporarily serve in other roles, such as customer service or telesales, which not only promoted the health and safety of our employees, but also provided
opportunities for learning and career development.
For a discussion of the oversight provided by the Verizon Board of Directors over the Company’ s human capital management practices, see the section entitled "Governance
— Our Approach to Gove rnance — Our Approach to Strategy and Risk Oversight — Oversight of Hum an Capital Management" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectua l property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively
pursue the filing and regis tration of patents, copyrigh ts, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We
also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable
them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take
advantage of Verizon's brands and the results of Verizon’ s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not
believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material ef fect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intelle ctual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments.
We also periodically receiv e notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against
us directly or against third-party suppliers of products  or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease
offering the relevant products or services.
Regulatory and Competitive Trends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon opera tes in a regulated and highly competiti ve market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For
many service s offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
11
Table of Contents
Federal, State and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless
communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon
anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from
others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential
conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC
spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years,  at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’ s wireless licenses,
challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless  license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by
that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow
customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers,
including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for
wireless tower and antenna facilities.
The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from
regulating the other "terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that
address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local
zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Broadband
Verizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC recognizes broadband internet access servic es as "information services" subject to a "light touch" regulatory
approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. However , a number of states have taken steps to regulate broadband and two of those cases related to
regulations in California and Vermont are being litiga ted in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open internet, which provides consumers
with compet itive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. Our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at
https://www .verizon.com/about/our -company/verizon-broadband-commitment.
Wireline V oice
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other  services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory
purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with
respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers
must comply with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent
local exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight
and requirements. V erizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated.
Video
Verizon offers a multichan nel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also
generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local
government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.
Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline,
wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the
FCC's privacy  requirements. Oversight of broadband internet access privacy and data security is governed  by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Europe's General Data
Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant
penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other new privacy laws took effect in 2020, including in Brazil and Maine. Generally , attention to privacy and data security
requirements is increasing at all levels of governme nt globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.
Public Safety and Cybersecurity
The FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emer gency communications  services and mandating widespread availability of both media
(broadcast/cable) and wireless emer gency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could
12
Table of Contents
occur in the future, however , the FCC or other regula tors may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use
by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its
networks from  vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity
of service during disasters; for example, the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities.
Inter carrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other
aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other
services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent
years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traf fic and for business data services may be appropriate.
Regulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Since the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state and local policies, regulations
and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the world’ s population. In addition, governments have imposed a
wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including telecommunica tions companies, can operate their business and interact with their
customers. Because the severity , magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the
crisis and the governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2021 and beyond remains uncertain and dif ficult to predict.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies factors that may adversely affect our business, opera tions, financial condition or futur e performance. This information
should be read in conjuncti on with "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and
related notes. The followin g discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our
business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwar d-looking
statements.
Operational Risks
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
Cyber attacks , including through the use of malware , computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for
obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an
adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, includ ing sensitive personal information of customers or employees or
valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including V erizon, have increased
in frequency , scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with phys ical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective
of the attacke r. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing
prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or
financial cond ition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, includ ing protection of our systems and networks, may be insuf ficient to
repel or mitigate the ef fects of a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other servi ce providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period
of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon  and/or a loss of market share to other communicati ons providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on
Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures
and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from  business interruption and litigation. Further , certain of Verizon’ s businesses, such as those offering security solutions
and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a
result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT industry , which includes offerings of telematics products  and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs
and expenses and reputatio nal harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise
of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or
proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and inves tor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’ s
results of operation or financial condition.
Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and natural disasters, including an increasing prevalence of wildfires
and intensified storm activ ities. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or
disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate
to sustain our operations through all such events.
14
Table of Contents
We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but these
measures and our overall disaster recovery planning  may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that
provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from
business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.
Public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an adverse effect on our operating results in 2020. Our business is based
on our ability  to provide products and services to customers throughout the United States and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those
products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected by a crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services, the way our employees
are able to provide services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products and services to us. For example, public and private
sector policie s and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon has taken in response to the health crisis to promote the health and safety of
our employees and provid e critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers, along with the related global slowdown in economic activity , resulted in decreased
revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our
business faces  in ordinary circumstances, such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationship s, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs
and availabili ty of financing. Because the severity , magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing,
the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2021 and beyond remains uncer tain and difficult to predict. In addition, the ultimate impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations depends on many factors, including those discussed above, that are not within our
control.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network
equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and
other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number
of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a
timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for exampl e, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic. If such failures occur , we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to
maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another , our business could be substantially
disrupted if we were requir ed to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major supplie rs with products or services from another source, especially if the
replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
The suppliers  and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict  whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We
expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result
of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of Decemb er 31, 2020, approximately 22.5% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which
could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented
by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it could have on
our operations.
Economic and Strategic Risks
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.
We face significant compe tition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions
among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications
companies, cable companie s, wireless service providers, satellite providers and application and device providers. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of
products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own compet itive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively , we could
experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reportin g units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on
its fair value and has caused us in the past, and may cause us in the future, to record goodwill impai rment charges. The amount of any impairment charge could be
significant and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in
15
Table of Contents
which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that
vary service and device pricing, promotions, incen tives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers. Our ability to compete
effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality , capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our
development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels, our ability to market our products and services
effectively and our capita l resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new
technologies and business models, changes in consum er preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to
respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience
a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.
Our industries are rapidly changing as new technolog ies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into
the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing offerings and introduce new
offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we
could lose customers to our competitors. W e may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market.
The deploym ent of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment and spectrum availability , unexpected costs, and regulatory
permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits
of the enhanc ements to our networks. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these
services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology , we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable
to do so on a cost-ef fective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession  or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of
our products and services.  In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use
fewer higher margin servic es, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly , under these conditions, the
business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse
economic conditions may lead to an increased numb er of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur , it could
have a material adverse ef fect on our results of operations.
Regulatory and Legal Risks
Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign
governments and international bodies. These regulato ry regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified
products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often
involved in regulatory and other governmental proce edings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proce edings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing
laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
obtaining the licenses need ed to carry out our busines s plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting
10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below , new laws or
regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change, or requirements limiting our ability to discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in
which we manage our wireline and wireless netwo rks and operate our Consumer , Business and Verizon Media businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue
opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.
• Privacy and data protection  - we are subject to feder al, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. Europe's General Data Protection
Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant
penalties for non-complian ce. In addition, other new privacy laws took effect in 2020, including in Brazil and Maine. Generally , attention to privacy and data
security requirements is increasing at all levels of
16
Table of Contents
government globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant
impact on our businesses.
• Regulation of broadband internet access services  - In its 2015 Title II Orde r, the FCC nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband
internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilitie s-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed
the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and return ed to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the
D.C. Circuit but may be revisited by future FCC commissions or by Congress and further appeals and challenges are possible; the outcome and timing of these or
any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states  have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and
other requirements on some of our services (in some cases dif ferent from the FCC’ s 2015 rules). The enforceability and ef fect of these state rules is uncertain.
• "Open Access"  - we hold certain wireless  licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulati ons, which generally require licensees of
particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices  and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the
FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.
The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the
return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subjec t to a substan tial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and
hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business
also faces personal injury  and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant
expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.
Financial Risks
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2020, Verizon had approximatel y $118.5 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing
revolving credit facility and $10.6 billion of outstand ing secured indebtedness. Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences,
including:
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would
reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements,
debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
• reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions;
• making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and
• exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates.
Adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets.
Adverse chan ges in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for
our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to
originate a sufficient amou nt of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent
rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost
of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with
which we do business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.

Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding
commitments.
With approxim ately 132,20 0 employees and approxim ately 190,000 retirees as of December 31, 2020 eligible to participate in Verizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of pension
benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for
these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and
mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs
could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under  the symbol "VZ". As of December 31, 2020, there were 510,654
shareholders of record.
Stock Repurchases
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . Under the program , shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchang e Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company's capital
allocation priorities.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our current or previously authorized share
buyback programs. At December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100
million.

Highlights of Our 2020 Financial Results
(dollars in millions)
Impacts of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
This disclosure discusses the actions Verizon has taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts it has had on our business, as well as related known or
expected trends. The disclosure in the remainder of this Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is qualified by the
disclosure in this section on the impacts of the COVI D-19 pandemic and, to the extent that the disclosure in the remainder of Management's Discussion & Analysis refers
to a financial or performance metric that has been affected by a trend or activity , that reference is in addition to any impact discussed in this section on the impacts of the
pandemic.
COVID-19 was identified in late 2019 and in 2020 spread throughout the world, including throughout the United States (U.S.). Public and private sector policies and
initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have varied significantly across the U.S., but at vario us times during the year ended December 31, 2020 a significant
percentage of the U.S. population was subject to meaningful restrictions on activities, which included limitations on the operation of businesses including retail operations,
requirements that individuals remain in or close to their homes, school closures, travel restrictions, limitations on large gatherings and other policies to promote or enforce
physical distancing.
20
Table of Contents
Similar restrictions have been implemented in many other countries in which we operate. As described below , these restrictions and our responses to them have significantly
impacted how our customers use our products and services, how they interact with us, and how our employees work and provide services to our customers. In addition,
governments have imposed a wide variety of consum er protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including telecommunications companies, can operate their
businesses and interact with their customers. The pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity ,
which has significantly impacted our customers. As a result, prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the pandemic.
The impact of COVID-19 in the future will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic and the related public policy actions, additional initiatives we may
undertake in response to employee, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers
change their behaviors over the longer term.
Operations
In response to the pandemic beginning in the first quarter 2020, we began executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our
employees and customers and to continue to provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers as they changed their ways of working and living. Some of the
initiatives we took include:
• Moving over 1 15,000 of our 132,200 employees to remote work arrangements.
• Temporarily closing nearly 70% of our company-owned retail store locations and moving to appointment-only access to our remaining store locations.
• Limiting our customer -focused field operations based on the criticality of the services being provided or repaired.
• Enhancing our safety protocols for employees working outside their homes.
• Providing temporary additional compensation to employees in front line roles that cannot be done from home.
• Adjusting other compensation and benefits programs to address circumstances created by the pandemic.
• Taking the Federal Comm unication Commission's (FCC's) "Keep Americans Connected" pledge, throu gh which we pledged to waive late fees for, and not
terminate service to, any of our consumer or small business customers who informed us that they had been impacted financially by the COVID-19 pandemic
through May 13, which we extended to June 30, 2020.
• Providing additional data allocations to permit wireless consumer and small business customers to remain connected during the first several months of the
pandemic.
• Temporarily waiving activation and upgrade fees through digital distribution channels.
• Working with business customers to address payment needs during the crisis.
• Maintaining ef fective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment.
As some of the restrictions on physical movement and limitations on business and other activities describe d above eased to varying degrees in the second half of 2020, we
resumed certain of our operations, with the health and safety of our employees and customers as our utmo st priority , and modified some of our temporary policies. These
initiatives include:
• Transitioning to facility access at limited capacity where feasible for those with remote work arrangements.
• Optimizing our sales channels to drive more activity through online and telesales to serve customers.
• Reopening temporarily closed company-owned retail store locations and introducing social distancing measures for employee and customer safety , such as touch-
less retail, appointment scheduling and curbside pickup options.
• Continuous monitoring of stores, as well as temporary closures and cleaning of stores that have an identified COVID-19 exposure.
• Starting July 1, customers who had notified us that they had been financially impacted by the pandemic and had an unpaid balance were automatically enrolled in
our "Stay Connected" repayment program, which allows customers to pay off their service balance over six months and extends any unpaid device payment plan
agreements by the number of months unpaid.
• Resuming most customer -focused field operations.
• Discontinuing certain of our temporary compensation and benefits arrangements.
We expect that we will continue to revise our approac h to these initiatives as the circumstances surroundin g the pandemic evolve in 2021 in order to meet the needs of our
employees, customers and the Company and continue to provide our innovative products and services.
Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
Verizon finished the fourth quarter 2020 in a strong financial position. As of December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 22.2  billion
Unsecured debt $ 118.5  billion
As of December 31, 2020 , our Cash and cash equiv alents balance was $22.2 billion  compa red to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 . We made the decision at the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain a higher cash balance in order to further protect the Company against the economic uncertainties associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic and to opportunistically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time when we believed that market conditions were favorable. During the three
months ended  December 31, 2020, we redeemed $566 million of unsecured notes maturing in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we have less than $150 million of unsecured
notes maturing in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had not drawn down on our $9.5 billion revolving credit facility and the unused borrowing capacity was
approximately $9.4 billion. The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to
borrow even if our busines s has incurred a material adverse change. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we issued $12.0 billion aggregate principal amount
of U.S dollar -denominated unsecured notes and £1.2 billion aggregate principal
21
Table of Contents
amount of Pound Sterling -denominated unsecured notes. In addition, we compl eted exchange offers with respect to 17 series of unsecured notes issued by Verizon, allowing
us to exchange the notes accepted in the exchange offers for new unsecured Verizon notes having a later maturity date and, for certain of the accepted series of notes, cash.
We also amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date to 2024. W e had no outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic, together with other dynam ics in the marketplace, has caused borrowing costs to fluctuate significantly and, in certain cases, restricted the ability
of borrowers to access the capital markets and other sources of financing. In order to provide financial flexibility and finance certain investments and projects, we may
continue to utilize external  financing arrangements that have been or may be affected by these market conditions. However , we believe that our cash on hand, the cash we
expect to generate from our operations, and cash from other sources of financing available to us are, and will continue to be, sufficient to meet our ongoing operating, capital
expenditure, debt service and investing requirements.
We expect to continue to have sufficient cash to fund our operations, although we could experience signi ficant fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period during
the pendency of the pandemic. The net cash generated from our operations provides our primary source of cash flows. While we have historically experienced consistently
low levels of payment delinquencies among our consumer and business accounts, beginning late in the first quarter 2020, we started to see increases in delinquencies across
our retail customer base and our small and medium business accounts. This change in delinquency rate moderated during the second quarter and improved to levels seen
before the COVID-19 pand emic during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Accordingly , our provision for credit losses increased in the first quarter 2020, but decreased in
the second quarter of 2020 and remained flat in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. If these levels of delinquencies begin to grow again, they could have a material adverse
impact on our cash flows. We could also experience fluctuations in our cash flows resulting from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on macroeconomic conditions in the
U.S. and our customers working to become current on their bills in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond.
In addition, we issue asset- backed debt secured by our device payment plan agreement receivables and the collections on such receivables. These transactions require us to
comply with various tests, including delinquency and loss-related tests, which, if not met, would cause the asset-backed debt to amortize earlier and faster than otherwise
expected. The holders of our asset-backed debt do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. However , if an early
amortization of our asset-backed debt occurs, includin g as a result of increased customer delinquencies or losses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, all collections on the
securitized device payment plan agreement receivables would be used to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed debt, and our financing cash flow requirements
would increase for the twelve months immediately following an early amortization event.
Impacts on Financial Results
Our revenues and expenses in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the actions we took to care for our employees and to keep our customers
connected and as a result of our customers’ changing  activities as well as the restrictions on activities and the global economic slowdown, as describe d below. The impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 2020 results was primarily a result of decreases in wireless service revenue, wireless equipment revenue and advertising and search
revenue at V erizon Media Group (V erizon Media), and the operational actions we took, as described above.
Revenues
The year ended December 31, 2020 included lower overage revenues and lower fees from activations and upgrades and fewer fees, as well as lower roaming revenues as
our customers significantly reduced travel during the year. As a result of our decision to keep our customers connected during the crisis, we experienced fewer step ups in
data plans in the first half of 2020. We saw the rate of step ups increase during the second half of 2020. During the first half of 2020, we also saw a reduction in advertising
and search revenue in Verizon Media, as customers  scaled back their advertising campaigns. This reduction moderated during the third quarter of 2020 and turned to
revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2020.
We have seen considerably less churn in the consumer wireless base and lower equipment volumes and upgrade rates since the beginning of the pandemic. As a result of
changing customer behaviors, we experienced significantly lower equipment revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Expenses
While certain  expenses, such as wireless equipment cost, were lower during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the revenue impacts discussed above, these
decreases were partially offset by an increase in comm ission expense. The increase in commission expense was a result of an expansion of our compensation programs for
both employees and agents  early in the pandemic. This COVID-19 relief program did not qualify for deferral treatment as defined by Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers;" however the costs were not materially dif ferent on a cash basis.
As a result of waiving late fees and keeping custom ers connected during the pandemic pursuant to our pledge, and pursuant to various state orders and laws, we saw
increases in delinquencies across our retail customer base and certain of our business accounts. This change in the delinquency rate has since moderated, as discussed
above; however , if the levels of delinquencies for our consumer and small and medium business customer s begin to grow again, additional provisions to our allowance for
credit losses may be required, which could be significant. W e continue to monitor customer behavior and our expected loss assumptions and estimates.

Other
Equity and debt markets experienced significant volatility during 2020 partially as a result of the pandem ic, and federal governmental actions to stimulate the economy
have significantly impacted interest rates. These circu mstances could affect the funding level of our pension plans and our calculated liabilities under our pension and other
postemployment benefit plans. Other impacts from the pandemic on our financial results in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond could result from a further slowdown in the
global economy , additional regulatory or legislative initiatives that impact our relationships with our custo mers, and other initiatives we undertake to respond to the needs
of our employees and our customers.

Verizon Medi a includes diverse media and technolog y brands that serve both consumers and businesses. Verizon Media provides consumers with owned and operated and
third-party search properties as well as mail, news, finance, sports and entertainment offerings, and provides other businesses and partners access to consumers through
digital advertising, content delivery and video streaming platforms. Verizon Media's total operating revenues were $7.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This
was a decrease of 5.6% from the year ended December 31, 2019.
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to posit ion ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During
the year ended December 31, 2020, these investme nts included $18.2 billion for capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Operating
Environment and Trends" for additional information.  We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers
with an ef ficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Global Network and Technology
We are focusing our capita l spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network, while also building our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our
network by utilizing small  cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Netwo rk densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing
mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several years, we have been leading the
development of 5G wireles s technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher
throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. As of
December 31, 2020, we have launched our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in 61 U.S. markets. We have commercially launched 5G Home in 12 of those markets. We also
launched our 5G Nationwide Network in October 2020, which is available in over 2,700 cities across the U.S. covering approximately 230 million people. 5G Nationwide
uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology , which allows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum
bands. With DSS, wheneve r customers move outside Verizon’ s high-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the
lower spectrum bands where the 5G Nationwide netw ork is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G
and 5G customers.
To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper -based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks supporting data, video and advanced business
services - areas where demand for reliable high-spee d connections is growing. We are evolving the architecture of our networks to a next-generation multi-use platform,
providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access
network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements,
speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost ef ficient manner .
Wireless Spectrum
In September 2020, Cellco  Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon, filed an applicati on to participate in FCC Auction 107, which relates to mid-band
wireless spectrum known as C-Band. The auction commenced on December 8, 2020. On February 24, 2021, the FCC issued a final notice announcing the conclusion and
results of the auction. In its final notice, the FCC announced that Cellco was the winning bidder with respect to approximately $45.5 billion of licenses. Down payments, in
the amount of 20% of the cost of the spectrum licen ses less the amount of the upfront payment made by bidders in October 2020, with respect to the auction are due on
March 10, 2021, and final payments in the amount of 80% of the cost of the spectrum licenses are due on March 24, 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the
auction, licensees also must pay their allocable shares of an estimated $13.1 billion in associated clearing and incentive costs at the times contemplated by the auction rules.
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss our overall results of opera tions and highlight special items that are not included in our segment results. Our revenues and expenses in 2020 were
impacted by the COVID-1 9 pandemic as a result of the actions we took to care for our employees and keep our customers connected and as a result of our customers’
changing activities, restrictions on activities and the global economic slowdown. See "Overview" for more  information. In "Segment Results of Operations," we review the
performance of our two reportable segments in more detail. A detailed discussion of 2018 items and year-over -year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not
included in this Form 10-K can be found in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form

Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services,
network access and transport costs, customer provisi oning costs, computer systems support, costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities and traffic
acquisition costs. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and
administrative expense.
Cost of servic es decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in traffic acquisitio n costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decreases in
costs related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid customers, roaming costs resulting from decreased travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
regulatory fees and personnel costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in customer premise  equipment, digital content, other direct costs and rent expense as
a result of adding capacity to the networks to support demand.
Cost of W ireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipmen t decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold as a result of an elongation of
the handset upgrade cycle as well as lower gross adds and upgrade volumes partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decreases were partially offset by a shift to higher
priced devices in the mix of wireless devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, the provision for credit losses, taxes
other than income taxes, advertising and sales commi ssion costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees and rent and utilities
for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services."
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a $1.2 billion loss resulting from the Auction 103 spectrum license
auction and a net gain from  dispositions of assets and businesses during 2019 (see "Special Items"), as well as an increase in sales commission expense. These increases
were partially offset by decreases in personnel costs, advertising expenses and the provision for credit  losses. The increase in sales commission expense during 2020
compared to 2019 was inclusive of a lower net deferral of

commission costs in the current year compared to the prior year, as well as sales compensation while certain of our stores and agent locations were closed due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable assets.
Media Goodwill Impairment
The goodwill  impairment charge recorded in 2019 for Verizon Media was a result of the Company's annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter (see "Critical
Accounting Estimates").

Other income  (expense), net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset
dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and foreign exchange gains and losses. The change in Other
income (expe nse), net during 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily driven by early debt redemption costs of $129 million recorded during 2020, compared to $3.6 billion
recorded during 2019 (see "Special Items"), partially offset by pension and benefit charges of $1.6 billion recorded during 2020, compared to pension and benefit charges of
$126 million recorded during 2019 (see "Special Items"). See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the other components of net

The average debt outstandi ng is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteen-month end balances of total short-term and long-term
debt, net of discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs.
The effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding.
We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt
leverage management.
Total interest expense decreased during 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates as a result of our refinancing activities.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The increase in the effective income
tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock
representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020. See "Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities" for discussion of the receipt of
the cash tax benefit in 2020.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the ef fective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreci ation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBIT DA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented
below , are non-generally accepted accounting princip les (GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information
in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and
acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’ s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding
back interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses of unconsolidated
businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our
financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’ s evaluation of
business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’ s operating performance to its competitors by
minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further , the exclusion of non-operational items and special
items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information.
It is management’ s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered
by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP . Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the
corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in
addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial inform ation to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and
segment perfo rmance. The non-GAAP financial infor mation presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable
to that of other companies.

Segment Results of Operations
We have three segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer , Business and Media, of which Consumer and Business are our reportable
segments. We measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision
maker ’s assessment of segment performance.(1)

To aid in the understandin g of segment performance  as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall
effectiveness of our segme nts. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional
insight into drivers of our segments’ operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated
differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies.

Segment earnings befor e interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA) , which  is presented below , is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an
alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital
expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by
adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBIT DA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total
segment operating revenues. Y ou can find additional information about our segments in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Consumer's total operating  revenues decreased durin g 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of decreases in Service and Wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by an
increase in Other revenue.
Service Revenue
Service revenue decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in wireless service and wireline voice and video services.
Wireless service revenue decreased $186 million, or 0.3%, during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in roaming and TravelPass revenues due to customers'
changing activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and waived fees as part of customer assistance initiatives that we undertook during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
decrease was further driven by a decrease in data overage revenues resulting from waived charges as part of customer assistance initiatives we undertook to address the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift of customer accounts to unlimited plans. These decrease s were partially offset by growth from reseller accounts, increases
in access revenues, customers shifting to higher priced plans, and growth in mobile security products included in certain protection packages. The growth from reseller
accounts was partially due to customers' changing activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Fios service revenue totaled $10.4 billion and decreased $95 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2019. This decrease was due to
decreases in Fios video and voice revenues. The decrease in Fios video revenue reflects a one-time credit provided to customers related to regional sport networks during the
COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings. Thes e decreases were partially offset by an increase in Fios internet
connections, reflecting increased demand for higher broadband speeds as consumers work and learn from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wireless Equipment Revenue
Wireless equipment revenu e decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of overall declines in wireless device sales partially due to an elongation of the handset

Other Revenue
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection offerings, leasing and interest
on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.
Other revenue increased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to pricing and subscriber increases related to our wireless device protection offerings, as well as cost

Cost of servi ces decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in costs related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid
customers, roaming costs, which were primarily drive n by a significant decrease in international travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and regulatory fees. These decreases
were partially of fset by increases in digital content costs, other direct costs and rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the networks to support demand.
Cost of W ireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold due to an elongation of the
handset upgrade cycle as well as lower gross adds and upgrade volumes primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and declines in the number of accessories sold partly due

Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increase d during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in sales commission and advertising expenses, partially
offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses and personnel costs. The increase in sales commission expense during 2020 compared to 2019 was inclusive of a lower

2019, respect ively . Wireless equipment revenues included in our Business segment amounted to approximately $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively .
As of end of period
Includes certain adjustments
Business's total operating revenues decreased during  2020 compared to 2019, as a result of decreases in Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise and Wholesale
revenues, partially of fset by an increase in Public Sector and Other revenue.
Small and Medium Business
Small and Medium Busine ss offers wireless services  and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, Internet Protocol (IP)
networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information technology services to our U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the
requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise, as described below .
Small and Medium Business revenues decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decre ase in wireless equipment revenue, declines related to the loss of
voice and DSL service connections and a decrease in IP networking. Wireless equipment revenue decrea sed as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold
primarily due to an elongat ion of the handset upgrade cycle as well as declines in activation volumes due to decreased demand and store closures resulting from the COVID-
19 pandemic. The decrease s were partially offset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold. These revenue decreases were partially offset by an
increase in wireless retail postpaid service revenue of 4.4% during 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of increases in the amount of wireless retail postpaid connections,
partially offset by lower roaming and usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the partial offset was an increase in revenue related to our wireless device
protection package as well as an increase in revenue related to Fios services.
Fios revenues  totaled $926 million, which represents an increase of 1.2% during 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in Fios revenues during 2020 compared to 2019
reflects the increase in total connections, as well as increased demand for higher broadband speeds as a result of the transition to work and learn from home during the
COVID-19 pandemic.(1)

Global Enterprise
Global Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector
customers.
Global Enterprise revenues decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to declines in traditional data and voice communication services as a result of
competitive price pressure s, as well as a decrease in wireless equipment revenue. Wireless equipment revenue decreased as a result of declines in the number of wireless
devices sold due to an elongation of the handset upgrade cycle as well as declines in activation volumes partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, wireless
equipment revenue decreased due to a shift to lowe r priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold. The decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in
advanced communication services revenue resulting primarily from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Blue Jeans Network, Inc. (BlueJeans) acquisition, and an increase in
customer premise equipment revenues. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the BlueJeans acquisition.
Public Sector and Other
Public Sector  and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and local governments and
educational institutions. These services include business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with
features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational institutions.
Public Sector and Other revenues increased during 2020 compared to 2019, driven by increases in wireles s retail postpaid service revenue as a result of an increase in gross
additions partially due to federal, state and educational agencies responding to the COVID-19 pandemic . In addition, the increases were driven by increases in wireless
equipment revenue and advanced communication services revenues. Wireless equipment revenue increased as a result of an increase in the number of wireless devices sold
primarily due to the COVI D-19 pandemic, partially offset by a shift to lower priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold. The increases in revenue were partially offset
by decreases in networking revenue and traditional voice communication services.
Wholesale
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that
use our facilities to provide services to their customers.
Wholesale revenues decreased during 2020 compare d to 2019, primarily due to declines in core data resulting from the effect of technology substitution and continuing
contraction of market rates due to competition, partially of fset by an increase in traditional voice communication services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Total Operating Expenses $ 27,189  $ 27,681 $ (492) (1.8)
Cost of Services
Cost of services were unchanged during 2020 compar ed to 2019, which was due to an increase in customer premise equipment and other direct costs, which was fully offset
by lower roaming costs primarily driven by a significant decrease in international travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic and decreases in costs related to the device
protection of ferings to our wireless retail postpaid customers and personnel costs.
Cost of W ireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower overall postpaid sales and a shift to lower priced units in the mix of wireless
devices sold, partially of fset by an increase in the net number of wireless devices sold to support distance learning programs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by increases in personnel costs and sales commission expense. The
increase in sales commission expense during 2020 compared to 2019 inclusive of a lower net deferral of commission costs in the current year compared to the prior year, as
well as sales compensation  while certain of our store s and agent locations were closed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by a one-time
international tax benefit.

between our estimated return on assets and our actual return on assets ($2.3 billion) and other assumption adjustments of $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion related to
healthcare claims experience. During 2019, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $204  million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statements of income.
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits charges in Other income (expense), net in
our consolidated statements of income.
See Note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance, pension and benefits char ges.
Loss on Spectrum License Auction
During 2020,  we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion as a result of the conclusion of the FCC incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37
Gigahertz (GHz), 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Impairment Charges
The impairment charges consist of write-downs of goodwill and other investments or assets. The goodw ill impairment charge of $186 million recorded during 2019 for
Verizon Media was a result of the Company's annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter (see "Critical Accounting Estimates"). In addition, we recorded an
impairment char ge of $50 million in Equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses related to a media joint venture investment during 2019.
Early Debt Redemption Costs
During 2020 and 2019, we recorded early debt redemption costs of $102 million and $3.6 billion, respectively .
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our early debt redemptions.
Net (Gain) Loss from Dispositions of Assets and Businesses
During 2020, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $119 million, primarily in connection with the sale of our Huffington Post business. During 2019, we recorded pre-tax net
gains from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million in connection with the sale of various real estate properties and businesses.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to dispositions of assets and businesses.
Operating Environment and Trends
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
Our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability  to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive
conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong financial and operating results
and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continu e to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders. We continue to lead in 4G
LTE performance while building momentum for our 5G network. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network that
enable ef ficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements.
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . We expect
future revenu e growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, incre asing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless
networks and services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5G technology will provide a
significant opportunity for growth in the industry in 2021 and beyond. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national
wireless servi ce providers,  including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with
resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wirele ss service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others.
We face competition from  other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the
provision of wireless produ cts and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and others
are of fering alternative
35
Table of Contents
means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video
content.
With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers
services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow , wireless service
providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and
market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional of fers.
We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer s shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive bundled
content with premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the
penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and
other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a
period of time, and some providers of fer device leasing arrangements.
Current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers,
satellite television companies, internet service providers, over -the-top providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated
service provi ders with global operations serve custo mers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these
providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand
recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to provide network reliability and offer
products, which include fiber-optic internet access, several video services, and voice services. Further , we will continue to offer our business and government customers
more robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity , platform and
solution layers.
The online advertising market continues to evolve as online users are migrating from traditional desktop to mobile and multiple-device usage. Also, there is a continued shift
towards progr ammatic advertising which presents opportunities to connect online advertisers with the appropriate online users in a rapid environment. Our media business
competes with other online search engines, advertisin g platforms, digital video services and social networks. We are experiencing pressure from search and desktop usage
and believe the pressure in these sectors will continue. We are implementing initiatives to realize syner gies across all of our media assets and build services around our core
content pillars to diversify revenue and return to growth.
We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjus t to changes in the competitive and economic environments and
maximize returns to shareholders.
2021 Connection Trends
In our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data services and
providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other
connected devices such as wearables. We believe the combination of our wireless network performance and Mix & Match unlimited plans provides a superior customer
experience, supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections. We expect to manage
churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and continued
focus in our distribution channels. We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas,
further suppo rted by the demand for higher speed internet connections. In Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear
television market. We expect to manage market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service, including options such as Mix & Match on Fios and other
offerings. We have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to alternative
technologies such as wireless, V oice over Internet Protocol, and cable for voice and data services.
In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the U.S. We continue to grow our retail connections while
operating in a competitive environment. We expect to maintain connection growth in part by adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network, in addition to leading the
build-out of our 5G network. We expect this connection growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions,
such as those around security , advanced communications and professional services. We expect to expand our existing services offered to business customers through our
Intelligent Edge Network, our multi-use platform.

Table of Contents
2021 Operating Revenue Trends
In our Consumer segment, we expect to see an accele ration of service revenue growth in 2021 as customers shift to higher access plans with additional services and increase
the number of devices they connect with our networks and services. We expect Fios revenue to benefit in 2021 as growth in our broadband customer base offsets the impact
of the shift from the triple-play bundle to standalone service.
In our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by an increase in the number of connections. We expect that our Fios products, through increased
penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth. Legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures. In addition, certain products and services
provided by our Public Sector and Global Enterprise  groups experienced elevated demand during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for those products
and services may return to more historical levels in 2021.
Our media business, Verizo n Media, is primarily made up of digital advertising products. We expect Verizon Media revenue to grow in 2021 as the strong advertising trends
from 2020 are expected to continue, with the exceptio n of political advertising spend. We will continue the implementation of initiatives to realize syner gies across all of our
media assets and build services around our core content pillars. W e expect positive growth in mobile services and products.
2021 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends
We expect our consolidate d operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our
overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2021 and beyond. Business Excellence initiatives
include the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology , driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks, evolving our Information Technology
strategy and the continuing  benefit from the Voluntary Separation Program. We believe our additional investments in our Business segment in both product simplification
and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G and One Fiber .
The goal of the Business Excellence initiative is to take $10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over four years, beginning in 2018. As part of this
initiative, we are focusing on both operating expen ses and capital expenditures. Our Business Excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion
through the end of 2020 from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal in 2021. We will continue to explore
opportunities for additional savings beyond the program.
We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportu nities and transactions that support continued profitable growth,
thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to
shareholders. Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.0% during 2020, making this the fourteenth consecutive year in which we have
raised our dividend.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business,
strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licen ses (see "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back
shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities").
Capital Expenditures
Our 2021 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE
network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying our 5G network, transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network
while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers, and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that the new network architecture
will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology , and create new enterprise
opportunities in the busine ss market. The level and the timing of the Company’ s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a
variety of factors outside of our control, such as material weather events, equipment availability from vend ors and permits from local governments. We believe that we have
significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant
capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

ongoing operating and investing requirements. We made the decision at the beginning of the COVID-19  pandemic to maintain a higher cash balance in order to further
protect the Company against the economic uncertaint ies associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and to opportunistically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time
when we believed that market conditions were favorable. We expect that our capital spending require ments will continue to be financed primarily through internally
generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development  activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of
TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone) or to acquire additional wireless spectrum, or to maintain an appropriat e capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and
cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See "Market Risk" for additional information
regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
Our available  external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, vendor
financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or
offered overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.
Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by opera ting activities increased by $6.0 billion during 2020 compared to
2019, primarily due to improvements in working capital, which includes the receipt of the $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold
during the fourth quarter 2019 and lower wireless volumes, as well as the receipt of $764 million relating to the settlement of interest rate swaps during 2020. In addition, an
employee benefits contribution as well as severance payments as a result of the Voluntary Separation Program in 2019 did not repeat in 2020. These comparative increases
were partially  offset by lower earnings in 2020. We made a $300 million discretionary employee benefits contribution during the first quarter 2019 to our defined benefit
pension plan. As a result of the 2019 discretionary pension contribution and higher actual asset returns than expected returns in both 2019 and 2020, we expect that there
will be no required pension funding through 2030, subject to changes in market conditions. The 2019 contribution also improved the funded status of our qualified pension
plan.
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expen ditures contin ue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing
infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges.
Capital expen ditures, inclu ding capitalized software, were $18.2 billion and $17.9 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively . Capital expenditures increased approximately
$253 million, or 1.4%, during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increased focus on 5G technology deployment.
Acquisitions of W ireless Licenses
During 2020 and 2019, we invested $2.1 billion and $898 million, respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses.
In March 2020, the FCC completed an incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses. Through December 31, 2020, we paid approximately $1.6 billion, including
$101 million paid in December 2019.
In 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions , Auction 101 and Auction  102. We paid approximately $521 million for spectrum licenses in
connection with these auctions.
During 2020 and 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of $360 million  and an insignificant amount,
respectively .
Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquir ed
During 2020 and 2019, we invested $520 million and an insignificant amount, respectively , in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.
In April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire BlueJeans, an enterprise-grade video conferencing and event platform, whose services are sold to
Business customers globally . The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately
$397 million, net of cash acquired.
During 2020, we completed various other acquisitions for approximately $127 million in cash consideration.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for information on our acquisitions.

In September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Through December 31, 2020, we paid a cash deposit of approximately $1.9 billion for the
licenses. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility
resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 billion. During 2019, net cash used in financing activities was
$18.2 billion.
2020
During 2020,  our net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 billion was primarily driven by $31.5  billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which
included $5.6 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. These cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by $17.2 billion used for
repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term  borrowings and finance lease obligations, which included $7.4 billion used for prepayments and repayments of asset-
backed long-term borrowings, $10.2 billion used for dividend payments and $2.7 billion used for other financing activities.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December 31, 2020, our total debt increased to $129.1 billion as compared to $111.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Our effective interest rate was 4.1% and 4.8% during
the years ended December  31, 2020 and 2019, respe ctively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in
interest rates do not have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December  31, 2020, approximately $29.0 billion, or 22.5%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on substantially all of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and
principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Verizon may continue to acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated
transactions, tender of fers, exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine, for cash or other consideration.

See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Dividends
The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal
cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2020, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6275 from
$0.6150 per share from the previous quarter . This is the fourteenth consecutive year that V erizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2020, we paid $10.2 billion in dividends.
2019
During 2019, our net cash used in financing activities of $18.2 billion was primarily driven by:
• $23.9 billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, which included $6.3 billion used for
prepayments and repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings;
• $10.0 billion used for dividend payments; and
• $1.8 billion used for net debt related costs.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $18.7 billion, which included $8.6 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December  31, 2019, our total debt was $111.5 billion, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective interest rate was 4.8%. The substantial majority of our
total debt portfolio consist ed of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December  31, 2019, approximately $23.5 billion, or 21.1%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on substantially all of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and
principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2019, we paid $10.0 billion in dividends.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2020,  the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $10.6 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-
party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financin g Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed
debt bankrup tcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in
connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators)
transfer devic e payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon
entities retain  the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed  to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan
agreement receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and
expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our
asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations
are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recours e to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to
Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment
obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-ba cked debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt
issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In May 2020, we amended and restated our outstanding ABS financing facility originally entered into in 2016, and previously amended and restated in 2019, with a number
of financial institutions (ABS Financing Facility). One loan agreement is outstanding in connection with the ABS Financing Facility , and such loan agreement was amended
and restated in May 2020. Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with
breakage costs. During 2020, we borrowed $1.3 billion and prepaid $4.0 billion under the loan agreement.

2021 Cr edit Agr eement
Delayed Draw T erm Loan Credit Agreement
On February 24, 2021 (the Effective Date), Verizon entered into a $25.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with two financial
institutions, which includes initial commitments of $12.5 billion from each of these parties. The Credit Agreement provides Verizon with the ability to borrow up to
$25.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including any potential acquisition of spectrum. The loans under the Credit Agreement are available during the period (the
Availability Period) beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier of (i) May 28, 2021, and (ii) the receipt by the two financial institutions of written notice by
Verizon of its election to terminate commitments pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The availability of the loans under the Credit Agreement, which have not yet been
funded, is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions that certain representations of Verizon are accurate in all material respects and the absence of certain event
of default. The loans under the Credit Agreement are to be made in a single borrowing on the funding date and will mature and be payable in full on the date that is 364 days
after the funding date unless extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The two financia l institutions may syndicate their commitments under the Credit
Agreement, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Inter est Rate and Fees
The loans under the Credit  Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of Verizon, (i) the base rate (defined as the greater of the rate last quoted by the Wall
Street Journa l as the "prime rate", the federal funds rate plus 0.500%, and the one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.000%, subject to a floor of
1.000%) or (ii) LIBOR, in each case plus a margin to be determined by reference to Verizon’ s credit ratings and ranging from 0.000% to 0.125% in the case of base rate
loans and 0.625% to 1.125% in the case of LIBOR loans. Additional mar gin of 0.125% is added to the loan on December 31, 2021.
Verizon will pay a commitment fee on the daily actual unused commitment of each lender starting on the date that is 60 days after the Effective Date through the last day of
the A vailability Period. This fee accrues at a rate determined by reference to V erizon’ s credit ratings and ranges from 0.070% to 0.125% per annum.
Prepayments
The Credit Agreement requires Verizon to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances or sales of equity
and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.
Covenants and Events of Default
The Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes
covenant, and affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. An event of default may result in
the inability to borrow in certain circumstances or the acceleration of any outstanding loan under the Credit Agreement, as applicable.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2020
and 2019, we issued 2.3 million and 3.8 million common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurc hases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There
were no repurchases of common stock during 2020 and 2019 under our current or previously authorized share buyback program.
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2020 or 2019.
Securities ratings assigned  by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a
timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserv e our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of
financial transactions, maintain our properties, provid e financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations,
and other similar covenants.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 totaled $22.2 billion, a $19.6 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the factors
discussed above.
Restricted cash at Decemb er 31, 2020 totaled $1.3 billion, relatively flat compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2019, primarily related to cash collections on the
device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GA AP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity  that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides
management, investors and other users of our financ ial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is
calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (includ ing capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure
of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash
flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments  made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business
acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 (dollars in millions)
Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 41,768  $ 35,746 
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 18,192  17,939 
Free cash flow $ 23,576  $ 17,807 
The increase in free cash flow during 2020 is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows, partially of fset by the increase in capital expenditures discussed above.
Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. We made
no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in 2020. In 2019, we made contributions of $300 million to our qualified pension plans. During 2020 and 2019
we made contributions of $57 million and $71 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively .
The Company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In
an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the
interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets  with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability . We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will
decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries;
however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $70 million in 2021.
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not
have funding  requirement s similar to the pension plans. We contributed $709 million and $449 millio n to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2020 and 2019,
respectively . Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $800 million in 2021.

Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Items included in purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinar y course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the
subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone
do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postre tirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Estimated qualified pension plan contributions include
expected minimum funding contributions, which commence after 2030 based on the plan's current funded status. Estimated postretirement benefit payments include
expected future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which
could impact the timing or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

We guarantee the debentures of our operating telepho ne company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In conn ection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.
As of Decem ber 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling approximately $677 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
Wireless Licenses and Goodwill
Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireles s licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible
assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or
changes in circumstances during an interim period providing impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent
appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair
value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is
possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing  and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market
participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and
adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $96.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting,
as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize
certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In the first quarter of 2020,  we reclassified substantia lly all of our 39 GHz wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, with a carrying value of $2.8 billion to assets held
for sale in connection with the FCC's incentive auctio n, Auction 103. As a result, these wireless licenses were adjusted down to their fair value of $1.6 billion resulting in a
pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after -tax).
During the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business
enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our
combined wireless busines s as a whole, as well as other factors. Our annual impairment tests in 2020 and 2019 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Goodwill
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of
whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair value of each the reporting unit being assessed.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition  activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the
reporting unit, as well as other factors.
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market appro ach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income
approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the
present value  of two comp onents-projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit
beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated  based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the
discrete perio d and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return,
that a marketplace particip ant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our
valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and
cost initiative s, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant
judgment involved in the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The select ion of companies was influenced by differences in growth and
profitability , and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently uncertain, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these
inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.
A proje cted sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negativ e impact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges.
Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) further anticipated decreases in service pricing, sales volumes and long-term growth rate as a result of
competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving
44
Table of Contents
the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse change s to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of
the reporting unit.
At December 31, 2020, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.8 billion, of which $17.2 billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our
Business reporting unit. We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020. Our qualitative
assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and,
therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In November  2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business, which resulted in changes to our segments and reporting units effective April 1, 2019. As a
result, we performed impairment assessments of the reporting units impacted by the strategic reorganization, specifically our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and
historical Connect reporting units on March 31, 2019, immediately before our strategic reorganization became effective. Our impairment assessments indicated that the fair
value for each of our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, and therefore did not result in a
goodwill impairment. We then performed quantitative assessments of our Consumer and Business reporting units on April 1, 2019, immediately following our strategic
reorganization. Our impairment assessments indicate d that the fair value for each of our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values
and therefore , did not result in a goodwill impairment. Our Media reporting unit was not impacted by the strategic reorganization and there was no indicator of impairment
as of the reor ganization date.
We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our qualitative assessments indicated
that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment.
We performed a quantitativ e impairment assessment for our Media reporting unit in 2019. In connection with Verizon’ s annual budget process during the fourth quarter of
2019, the leadership at both Verizon Media and Verizon completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of Verizon Media's business prospects resulting in
unfavorable adjustments to Verizon Media's financial projections. These revised projections were used as a key input into Verizon Media's annual goodwill impairment test
performed in the fourth quarter of 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, consistent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting
current assum ptions and inputs, including our revise d projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of the
Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impa irment charge of approximately $186 million ($176 million after-
tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 in our consolidated  statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Media reporting unit had been fully written off as a result of the
impairment char ge.
At December 31, 2019, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.4 billion, of which $17.1 billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $7.3 billion was in our
Business reporting unit.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefit Plans
We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2020, in the
aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded  the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in future pension plan expense. Other postretirement benefit
plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets,  resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assump tions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets
and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis
of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in
the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is
provided in the table below .

* In determining its pension  and other postretirement obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.6%. The rate was selected to approximate the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at Decemb er 31, 2020. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided
with the time periods during which benefit payments  are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300
million par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost
component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach
45
Table of Contents
refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income
corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide
a more precise estimate of interest cost.
Income T axes
Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in
connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global
commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of
deferred income tax assets  and the timing and amoun t of income tax payments. We account for tax benef its taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance
with the accounting standa rd relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and
information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact
income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax
payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unan ticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Property , Plant and Equipment
Our Property , plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property , plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate
Property , plant and equipm ent on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expec t that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property ,
plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2020 depreciation expense of $2.7 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately
$4.5 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense.
Accounts Receivable
Prior to Janua ry 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding
allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain ed allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our
direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-
channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as
incurred. How ever, receivable balances were assesse d quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to
January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts
receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balan ce sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from
the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowan ce for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on
management’ s expectation of the asset’ s collectabilit y. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the
customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’ s expectations of conditions
in the future, if applicabl e. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk
characteristics.
We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt
expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative
factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our
proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer
groups: consumer , small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium
business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-of f balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to
write-of f. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on
management’ s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-
off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. W e consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.
If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivabl es in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have
to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would af fect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Blue Jeans Network, Inc.
In April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire BlueJeans, an enterprise-grade video conferencing and event platform, whose services are sold to
Business customers globally . The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately
$397 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
TracFone Wireless, Inc.
In September  2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (Tracfone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire Tracfone, a provider of prepaid and value mobile
services in the U.S. Under the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, we will acquire all of the stock of Tracfone for approximately $3.1 billion in cash and $3.1 billion
in Verizon common stock, subject to customary adjustments, at closing. The number of shares issued will be based on an average trading price determined as of the closing
date and is subject to a minimum number of shares issuable of 47,124,445 and a maximum number of shares issuable of 57,596,544. The Tracfone Purchase Agreement also
includes up to an additional $650 million in future cash consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The
transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2021.
Bluegrass Cellular
In October 2020, we entere d into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular , a rural wireless operator serving central Kentucky . Bluegrass Cellular
provides wireless service to 210,000 customers in 34 counties in rural service areas 3, 4, and 5 in Central Kentucky . The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and
closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.
Spectrum License Transactions
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to
enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our spectrum license transactions.
Other
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements  to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
In November 2020, Verizo n entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $126 million in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction closed in February 2021.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of
derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards. We
do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in
optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk
parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that
would completely eliminate the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiat ed derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit
support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements conta in rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may
be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2020, we held $0.2 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral
exchange agreements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, we held an insignificant amount of
collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. While
we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonpe rformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would
result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.

Table of Contents
Interest Rate Risk
We are expos ed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2020,
approximately 83% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements
designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including
our interest rate swap agreements that are designated  as hedges, of approximately $227 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected
by changes to our credit ratings.
Certain of our floating rate debt and our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to LIBOR as the benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of
recent U.S. and internation al regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to become unavailable or to perform or be
reported differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted  but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate debt
or expo sure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate
debt, taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield
curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in
market interest rates.

At December 31, 2019 128,633 119,288 139,980 
Interest Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are currently based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of
designated debt issuances . At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were $787 million and $303 million, respectively . At
December 31, 2019, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were $568 million and $173  million, respectively . At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total
notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $17.8 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively .
Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $797 million and $604 million, respectively . At December 31, 2020 and
2019, the total notional amount of the forward starting interest rate swaps was $2.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively .
Interest Rate Caps
We also have interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate
our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facilities and ABS Notes. The fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant at
both December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding total notional amount for these contracts and, at December 31, 2019, the total notional
amount of these contracts was $679 million.
Treasury Rate Locks
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. There was no outstanding notional amount for treasury rate locks at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency . The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations
into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance
sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transacti ons are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2020, our
primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar , Canadian Dollar and Japanese Y en.
48
Table of Contents
Cross Currency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian
Dollar -denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or
losses. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was $1.4 billion and $211 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively . At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
fair value of the liability of these contracts was $196 million and $912 million, respectively . At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the cross currency
swaps was $26.3 billion and $23.1 billion, respectively .
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into British
Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities
of international subsidiaries, as well as foreign excha nge risk related to debt settlements. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the asset and liability of
these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shar eholders and the Board of Dir ectors of V erizon Communications Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Cont rol–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our
opinion, V erizon maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensiv e income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed  in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 25, 2021
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
Verizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting include d in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Verizon’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to V erizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting
includes those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s
assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condition s, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations
Description of the Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. At December 31, 2020, the Company’ s aggregate
defined benef it pension obligation was $22.2 billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $20.1 billion, resulting in an
unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $2.1 billion. Also, at December 31, 2020, the other postret irement benefits obligation was
approximately $16.2 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to
measure empl oyee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual return on
plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions.
Auditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actua rial assumptions (e.g., discount
rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in the measurement process. These assumptions had a
significant ef fect on the projected benefit obligation.
How W e Addr essed the Matter in
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the desig n and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the employee benefits
obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’ s review of the employee benefit obligation calculations,
the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuary .
To test the employee benef it obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the meth odologies used, the significant
actuarial assumptions discussed above and the under lying data used by the Company . We compared the actuarial assumptions used by
management to historical trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year
due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition,
we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’ s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the
maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we
compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash
flows. To evaluate the health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to
assist in evaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, and whether
any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying
data, including the participant data provided to management’ s actuarial specialists.

Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries
Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting throug h its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, technology , information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we
offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity ,
security and control.
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - V erizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and V erizon Business Group (Business).
Our Consumer segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most
extensive wireless network s in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine
states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic  network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a
traditional copper -based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail
customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Our Business  segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, includin g data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking
solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and
products. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to
customers around the world.
Consolidation
The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity , involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or
suggest evide nce of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable
interest entitie s (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in
Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exerc ise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Presentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that af fect
reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable,
including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandem ic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at
reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration  of the impacts from COVID-19 remain unclear , the Company’ s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions
change. Actual results could dif fer significantly from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property , plant and equipment, and other long-lived assets,
the increment al borrowing rate for the lease liability , fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible
assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.
Revenue Recognition
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These
services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide
services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterp rises and government customers. We account for these revenues
under Accoun ting Standar ds Update (ASU) 2014-09 , "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified
retrospective approach. This standard update, along  with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common
revenue standard for GAAP . The standard update also amended prior guidance for the recognition of costs to obtain and fulfill
59
Table of Contents
contracts with customers such that incremental costs of obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers are deferred and amortized consistent with the
transfer of the related good or service.
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device paym ent plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent.
Natur e of Pr oducts and Services
Telecommunications
Service
We offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service
allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer .
Monthly service is general ly billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for addition al information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds
the allowance, the overage  usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the
option (typically on a month-to-month basis).
For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a
contract liabil ity, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our
networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.
Equipment
We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and
accepted by the customer , as this is when control passes to the customer . In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings
through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service
contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less).
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-be aring installment note, which is repaid by the customer , typically
over a 24-mo nth term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over
a specified term, contingen t upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations
based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term,
differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer . We periodically assess, at the
contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative
considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided,
interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credi t risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts
and circumstances, we determined that the financing  component in our existing wireless device paymen ts and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not
significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement
when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.
Wireless Contracts
For our wireless contracts , total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and
equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding
subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless servic e to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month
contracts that can be cance lled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a
wireless devic e. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as
penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled.
The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified
portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order . We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The
full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduc tion to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The
guarantee liability was insignificant at December 31,
60
Table of Contents
2020 and 2019. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is
allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.
Our fixed-term  plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents
the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price,
resulting in a contract liability .
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining
the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and
credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or
incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
Wireline Contracts
Total consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each
service. While many contr acts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recogni tion pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the
services are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without
any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with
customers such as penaltie s that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations
involves judgment and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures.
We may provide performa nce-based credits or incen tives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable
consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information
becomes available.
Wireless and W ireline Contracts
For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or services provided to the
customer . This principal-versus-agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or
services were  controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer . To evaluate if we have control , we consider various factors including whether we are primarily
responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements
and other performance-bas ed advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. Our
media business, Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily earns revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party
properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising and subscription arrangements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are
delivered, while subscription contracts are recognized  over time. We are generally the principal in transac tions carried out through our advertising platforms, and therefore
report gross revenue based  on the amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where
our proprietary technology enables us to identify , enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is further
supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing.
We offer telematics service s including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics service revenue is generated primarily through subscription contracts.
We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these
costs are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in
which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information.

Table of Contents
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share
include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 2 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted earnings
per common share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were a total of approximately 4 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of
restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Depo sits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets:
(dollars in millions)
At December 31, 2020 2019 Increase / (Decrease)
Cash and cash equivalents $ 22,171  $ 2,594 $ 19,577 
Restricted cash:
Prepaid expenses and other 1,195  1,221 (26)
Other assets 132 102 30 
Cash, cash equivalents and r estricted cash $ 23,498  $ 3,917 $ 19,581 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in
equity securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative perm itted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer . For investments
in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee
are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Allowance for Credit Losses
Prior to Janua ry 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding
allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain ed allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our
direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-
channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as
incurred. How ever, receivable balances were assesse d quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to
January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts
receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balan ce sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from
the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowan ce for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on
management’ s expectation of the asset’ s collectabilit y. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the
customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’ s expectations of conditions
in the future, if applicabl e. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk
characteristics.
We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared  risk characteristics of "new customers" and "existing customers."
New customers are defined  as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days if they are classified as a Consumer segment customer , or less than 12 months if
they are classified as a Business segment customer . Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for more than 210 days if they are in
Consumer , or more than 12 months if they are in Business. We record an allowance to reduce the receiv ables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device
payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is
determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the
custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance
balance.

We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer
groups: consumer , small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium
business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-of f balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to
write-of f. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on
management’ s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-
off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. W e consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.
Inventories
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipmen t held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out
basis) or net realizable value.
Plant and Depreciation
We record property , plant and equipment at cost. Property , plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset
was placed in service.
When deprec iable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciati on are deducted from the property , plant and equipment accounts
and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property , plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the
acquisition or construction  of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-
related assets.
In conn ection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property , plant and equipment during 2018, we determined that the average useful lives of certain
assets would be increased. These changes in estimate s were applied prospectively in 2018 and resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense of $271 million for the year
ended Decem ber 31, 2018. While the timing and extent of current deployment plans are subject to ongoing analysis and modification, we believe that the current estimates
of useful lives are reasonable.
Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that have a useful life and term
in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they add
significant new functionality . Planning, software maintenance and training costs for internal-use software  and cloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred. We capitalize interest assoc iated with the development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 7 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets.
Costs incurre d in implementing a cloud computing arrangement are deferred during the application-development stage and recorded as Prepaid expense and Other in our
consolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we stop deferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs.
For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" below . Also, see Note 4 for additional information of
internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software costs, deferred costs associated with cloud computing
arrangements are subject to impairment testing.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of busin esses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually
in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment.  However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and
perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA ) margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition
activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.
The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is perfo rmed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a
market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach) to its carrying
63
Table of Contents
value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy , see Fair Value Measurements discussion below for additional information.
The market approach inclu des the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is
based on the present value  of two components, a projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the
reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash
flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected
return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value  exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the
excess carryin g value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic
planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates
and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum
to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally  ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that there are currently no legal,
regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-
lived intangib le asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an
indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our
nationwide wireless network.
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and
proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic
conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections
and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our comb ined wireless business, as well as other factors. See Note 4 for
additional information regarding our impairment tests.
Our quantitat ive assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licen ses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Using a
quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield  approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation
approach that values the wireless licenses by calculat ing the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except
the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplac e participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated
wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estim ated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses,
then an impairment char ge is recognized.
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The
capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.
Wireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded
within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated
statements of cash flows.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of
our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset
group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undis counted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would
perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible
assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For informati on related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our
other acquired intangible assets, see Note 4.

Leases
We lease network equipme nt including towers, distri buted antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other
various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For
arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and
lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.
For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which
represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental
borrowing rate for operatin g and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company
would have to pay to borro w an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-
adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.
In those circumstances where the Company is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease
components as a single lease component for substa ntially all of our asset classes. Additionally , in arrangements where we are the lessor , we have customer premise
equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in
Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.
Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statements  of income, based on the use of the facility or equipm ent on which rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to
both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consis t of payments dependent on various external indicators, including
real estate taxes, common area maintenance char ges and utility usage.
Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
We recognize the amortiza tion of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use
asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the effective
interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
See Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-1 1, ASU 2018-20 and
ASU 2019-01, Leases (T opic 842).
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financ ial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of
the significance of a particular input to the fair value  measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their
categorization within the fair value hierarchy .
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which
we operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are
recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approac h for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
of the position. In evalua ting whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the
appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledg e of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition
65
Table of Contents
threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50 perce nt likely of being realized upon ultimate  settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements
will generally result in one or more of the following : an increase in a liability for income taxes payable,  a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a
deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for
additional information.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using
average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchan ge rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation
adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses
resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other income (expense), net.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement  health care and life insura nce benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs
and credits resulting from  changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remainin g service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in
Other income  (expense), net in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon
management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy . See Note 1 1 for additional information.
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability in the conso lidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior
service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currenc y exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management
strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks,
interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
We measure all derivatives  at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidate d balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily
using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values
of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of
certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative
translation adjustment and partially of fsets the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.
Cash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the cash flow classification of the
related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information.
Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity
investors that do not have the ability to make signific ant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations throug h voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the resid ual returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary
beneficiary . The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
The following ASUs were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB), and have been recently adopted by V erizon.
DescriptionDate of
AdoptionEffect on Financial Statements
ASU 2016-13 , ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, and ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Cr edit Losses (T opic 326)
In June 2016, the F ASB issued T opic 326 which requires certain financial assets
to be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for estimated credit losses,
such that the net receivable represents the present value of expected cash
collection. In addition, this standard update requires that certain financial assets
be measured at amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated credit losses
expected to occur over the life of the assets. The estimate of credit losses must
be based on all relevant information including historical information, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that af fect the collectability
of the amounts. An entity applies the update through a cumulative ef fect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period
in which the guidance is ef fective (January 1, 2020). A prospective transition
approach is required for debt securities for which an other -than-temporary
impairment has been recognized before the ef fective date. Early adoption of this
standard is permitted.1/1/2020We adopted T opic 326 beginning on January 1, 2020 using the modified
retrospective approach with a cumulative ef fect adjustment to opening
retained earnings recorded at the beginning of the period of adoption.
Therefore upon adoption, we recognized and measured estimated credit
losses without revising comparative period information or disclosures.
We recorded the pre-tax cumulative ef fect of $265 million ($200 million
net of tax) as a reduction to the January 1, 2020 opening balance of
retained earnings, which was related to the timing of expected credit loss
recognition for certain device payment plan receivables based upon
reasonable and supportable forecasts of the future economic condition as
of January 1, 2020. Additionally , the adoption of the standard impacted
the consolidated balance sheet by presenting financial assets measured at
amortized cost separate from the allowance for estimated credit losses.
There is no significant impact to our operating results upon the adoption
of this standard update.
ASU 2020-04, Refer ence Rate Reform (T opic 848)
Topic 848 provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in
accounting for reference rate reform. T opic 848 provides optional expedients and
exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to transactions af fected by reference rate
reform if certain criteria are met.3/12/2020Topic 848 was ef fective for the Company beginning on March 12, 2020,
and we will apply the amendments prospectively through December 31,
2022. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements for
the current period as a result of adopting this standard update.
`
The cumulative after -tax ef fect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of T opic 326 were as follows:

Opening Equity Balance Sheet Adjustments fr om Accounting Standards Adopted in 2019 and 2018
On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet
for the adoption of T opic 842 was as follows:

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income and other ASUs. We adopted Topic 606 using the modified
retrospective method. We early adopted ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax
effects resulting from T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The

Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment.
Revenue by Category
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and Business. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services within
Consumer , and customer groups (Small and Medium  Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional
information on revenue by segment.
Corporate and other includes the results of our media business, V erizon Media, and other businesses. V erizon Media generated revenues from contracts with customers under
Topic 606 of approximately $7.0 billion, $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively .
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device paym ent plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent. As allowed by the practical expedient within Topic 842, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for those arrangements of customer premise
equipment where we are the lessor as components accounted for under Topic 606. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were
approximately $3.0 billion, $3.1 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively .
Remaining Performance Obligations
When allocat ing the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service performance
obligations which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance
obligations. We apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance
obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situation  primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service
contracts. At December 31, 2020, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 90% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 75% of our wireline Consumer
and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to December 31, 2019, for which month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 88% of our wireless
postpaid contracts and 61% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts .
Additionally , certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional services are recognized when the customer
exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).
Contracts for wireless services are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time (typica lly under a device payment plan) or contain terms ranging from
greater than one month to up to two years (typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally , customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional services
purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated
to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not
accounted for as month-to-month contracts.
Our Consumer group custo mers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wirel ess service under their own brands to their respective customers.
Reseller arrangements generally include a stated contract term, which typically extends longer than two years and, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue
commitment over the contract term for which revenues will be recognized in future periods.
Consumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however , they may have a service term of two years or shorter than twelve months.
Certain contr acts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual
commitments in each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term; however , a significant number of contracts for wireline services with our
Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months or less.
68
Table of Contents
Additionally , there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services and certain Verizon Media contracts with customers that have a
contractual minimum fee over the total contract term.  We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to those contracts; thus, they are excluded
from the time bands below . These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately five years ending in July 2026 and have aggregate contract minimum payments
totaling $2.6 billion.
At December 31, 2020, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations for total Verizon that is expected to be recognized for 2021, 2022 and thereafter
was $17.4 billion, $6.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively . Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications.
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presen ted in our consolidated balance sheets represent an unconditional
right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in
advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer , or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining
control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:
At December  31, At December 31, At January 1,
(dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2019
Receivables $ 12,029  $ 12,078 $ 12,104 
Device payment plan agreement receivables 10,358  11,741 8,940 
Balances reflected are subsequent to the adoption of T opic 326 on January 1, 2020.
Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts: leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device paym ent plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent.
Included in device payment plan agreement receivab les presented in Note 8. Balances do not include receivables related to contracts completed prior to January 1, 2018
and receivables derived from the sale of equipment on a device payment plan through an authorized agent.
The following table presents information about contract balances:
At December  31, At December 31, At January 1,
(dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2019
Contract asset $ 937 $ 1,150 $ 1,003 
Contract liability 5,598  5,307 4,943 
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to custom ers but for which we do not have an unconditional right at the
reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contra ct revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In conjunction with these arrangements, a
contract asset  is created, which represents the differen ce between the amount of equipment revenue recogn ized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the
customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless
services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The
contract asset  balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at
inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability .
Contract assets decreased $213 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in the contra ct asset balance was primarily due to reclassifications to accounts
receivable due to billings on existing contracts and impairment charges of $75 million, partially offset by new contracts driven by customer activity related to wireless.
Contract assets increased $147 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in the contra ct asset balance was primarily due to new contracts and increases
in sales  prom otions recogn ized upfront, driven by customer activity related to wireless and Fios services,  partially offset by reclassifications to accounts receivable due to
billings on existing contracts and impairment char ges of $1 13 million.
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill
service one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to
the customer . The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.
Contract liabilities increase d $291 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions
recognized over time and upfront fees, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billin gs, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations
related to wireless and Fios services. Contract liabilit ies increased $364 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in contract liabilities was primarily
due to increases in sales promotions recognized(1)

over time and upfront fees, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to
wireless and Fios services.
Revenue recognized durin g the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to contract liabilities existing at January 1, 2020 and 2019 were $4.3 billion and $4.2
billion, respectively , as performance obligations related to services were satisfied.
The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Contract Costs
As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense over the
respective periods of expec ted benefit. We recognize  an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction
with obtaining customer contracts. We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the
customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate . Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device
upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer
relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We also defer costs incurre d to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance
obligation under the contra ct; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our
performance obligations and recorded in Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to
install circuits.
We determine the amortiza tion periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract
portfolios.
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.
Collectively , costs to obtain  a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a two-to five-year period. Deferred contract
costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively .
The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
At December  31, At December 31,
(dollars in millions) 2020 2019

Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,472  $ 2,578 
Other assets 2,070  1,911 
Total $ 4,542  $ 4,489 
For the years ended Decem ber 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized expense of $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively , associated with the amortization of deferred contract
costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds
the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing
those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019.

Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Spectrum License Transactions
During 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions, Auction 101 and Auction 102. Verizon participated in these auctions and was the high
bidder on 9 and 1,066 licenses, respectively , in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted  an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521
million for the licenses. W e received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.
In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands concluded. Verizon participated in this
incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our
39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive paymen ts that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon
amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of $1.6 billion, of which
$101 million was paid in December 2019. In connecti on with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) was recorded in Selling, general
and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial
substance. See Note 4 for additional information. The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in Wireless licenses in our
consolidated balance sheet. The average remaining renewal period for these acquired licenses was 9.9 years.
The fair value  of the licens es represents a Level 2 measurement as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and was
determined based on the final auction price for each defined geographical area.
In September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. V erizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder on 557 licenses in the 3.5 GHz
band. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid a cash deposit of approximately $1.9 billion for the licenses. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and
purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet until the correspond ing licenses are received, and within Net cash used in investing
activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The timing of when the licenses will be issued will be determined by the FCC after all payments have been made.
In September 2020, Cellco  Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon, filed an applicati on to participate in FCC Auction 107, which relates to mid-band
wireless spectrum known as C-Band. The auction commenced on December 8, 2020. On February 24, 2021, the FCC issued a final notice announcing the conclusion and
results of the auction. In its final notice, the FCC announced that Cellco was the winning bidder with respect to approximately $45.5 billion of licenses. Down payments, in
the amount of 20% of the cost of the spectrum licen ses less the amount of the upfront payment made by bidders in October 2020, with respect to the auction are due on
March 10, 2021, and final payments in the amount of 80% of the cost of the spectrum licenses are due on March 24, 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the
auction, licensees also must pay their allocable shares of an estimated $13.1 billion in associated clearing and incentive costs at the times contemplated by the auction rules.
During 2020 and 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of $360 million and an insignificant amount,
respectively . During 2018, we entered into and compl eted various wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path)
and NextLink W ireless LLC (NextLink).
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path, a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for fifth-generation (5G) wireless services, for
total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders
$184.00 per share, payable  in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately $736 million, consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the
FCC. The transaction closed in February 2018 at whic h time we issued approximately 49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately $2.4 billion, and
paid the associated cash consideration.
The acquisitio n of Straight Path was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded
approximately $4.5 billion of wireless licenses and $1.4 billion of a deferred tax liability . The spectru m acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G
technology deployment.
Blue Jeans Network, Inc.
In April 2020 , we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Blue Jeans Network, Inc. (BlueJ eans), an enterprise-grade video conferencing and event platform,
whose servic es are sold to Business customers globally . The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the
transaction was approximately $397 million, net of cash acquired.
The financial  results of BlueJeans are included in the consolidated results of Verizon from the date of acquisition. Revenue related to BlueJeans was approximately
$73 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
71
Table of Contents
The acquisiti on of BlueJeans was accounted for as a business combination. We are currently assessing the identification and measurement of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the close of the acquisition, subject to customary closing adjustments. Preliminarily , we recorded approximately
$253 million of goodwill and $190 million of other intangible assets, which primarily consisted of customer lists and internally developed technology . Goodwill is
calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill represents
future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within Business.
TracFone Wireless, Inc.
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (Tracfone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a provider of
prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. Under the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, we will acquire all of the stock of Tracfone for approximately
$3.1 billion in cash and $3.1 billion in Verizon common stock, subject to customary adjustments, at closing . The number of shares issued will be based on an average trading
price determined as of the closing date and is subject  to a minimum number of shares issuable of 47,124,445 and a maximum number of shares issuable of 57,596,544. The
Tracfone Purchase Agreement also includes up to an additional $650 million in future cash consideration  related to the achievement of certain performance measures and
other commercial arrangements. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2021.
Bluegrass Cellular
In October 2020, we entere d into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular , a rural wireless operator serving central Kentucky . Bluegrass Cellular
provides wireless service to 210,000 customers in 34 counties in rural service areas 3, 4, and 5 in Central Kentucky . The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and
closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.
Other
In July 2019, Verizon completed a sale-leaseback transaction for buildings and real estate. See Note 6 for additional information related to the transaction. In connection
with this transaction and other insignificant transactions, we recorded a pre-tax net gain from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million in Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
During 2020,  we completed various other acquisit ions for approximately $127 million in cash consideration. During 2019 and 2018, we completed various other
acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
In November 2020, Verizo n entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $126 million in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction closed in February 2021.
Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Wireless Licenses
The carrying amounts of W ireless licenses are as follows:
(dollars in millions)
At December 31, 2020 2019
Wireless licenses $ 96,097  $ 95,059 
At December  31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively , of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which
we were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $242 million and $321 million of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively .
In the first quarter of 2020,  we reclassified substantia lly all of our 39 GHz wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, with a carrying value of $2.8 billion to assets held
for sale in connection with the FCC's incentive auctio n, Auction 103. As a result, these wireless licenses were adjusted down to their fair value of $1.6 billion resulting in a
pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion  ($914 million after-tax) in 2020. The new reconfigured licenses were received  in the second quarter 2020 and had a value of $3.4 billion. See
Note 3 for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions in 2020 and 2019.
During 2020, we renewed  various wireless licenses  in accordance with FCC regulations. The average renewal period for these licenses was 10 years. See Note 1 for
additional information.
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In 2020 and 2019, we
performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. In 2018,
our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated
carrying amount of the licenses as of the test

date. Our annual assessme nts in 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licen ses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in
impairment.
Our strategy requires signi ficant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our
networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems
and data system capabilities.
Goodwill
The Company transitioned into our new reporting structure as of April 1, 2019, which resulted in certain changes to our operating segments and reporting units. Upon the
date of reorganization, the goodwill of our historical Wireless reporting unit, historical Wireline reporting unit and historical Verizon Connect reporting unit were reallocated
to our new Consumer and Business reporting units using a relative fair value approach.
Changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill are as follows:

Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to BlueJeans and an other insignificant transaction. See Note 3 for additional information.
We performed  qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019. Our qualitative assessments
indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not
result in an impairment.
We performed  impairment assessments of the reporting units impacted by the strategic reorganization, specifically our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and historical
Connect reporting units on March 31, 2019, immedia tely before our strategic reorganization became effective. Our impairment assessments indicated that the fair value for
each of our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, and therefore did not result in a goodwill
impairment. We then performed quantitative assessments of our Consumer and Business reporting units on April 1, 2019, immediately following our strategic
reorganization. Our impairment assessments indicate d that the fair value for each of our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values
and therefore , did not result in a goodwill impairment. Our Media reporting unit was not impacted by the strategic reorganization and there was no indicator of impairment
as of the reor ganization date.
We performed quantitative impairment assessments for our Media reporting unit in 2019 and 2018. For details on our Media reporting unit, refer to the discussion below .
Our Media business, Verizon Media, experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings.
These pressures were expe cted to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our compe titors in the digital advertising business. Our Media business also
achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Y ahoo and AOL businesses.
In connection  with Verizon’ s annual budget proce ss during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, the leadership at both Verizon Media and Verizon completed a
comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of Verizon Media's business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Verizon Media's financial projections.
These revised projections were used as a key input into V erizon Media's annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, consist ent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method
reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth(1)

rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of the Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill
impairment charge of approximately $186 million ($176 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a charge of $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax) in the fourth
quarter of 2018 in our consolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Media reporting unit has been fully written of f as a result of these impairment char ges.
We performed a quantitativ e impairment assessment for all of the other reporting units in 2018. Our impa irment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our historical
Wireless, historical W ireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

Note 6. Leasing Arrangements
We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate and connectivity mediums including
dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which
include options that we can elect to extend the leases  term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered
into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or terminate the lease. Therefore, as of
the lease
74
Table of Contents
commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that
option.
During March  2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approxim ately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a
minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew . We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated
balance sheets and depreci ate them accordingly . In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers , American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground
leases related to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these
leases and accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. We do not expect to be
required to make ground lease payments unless American T ower defaults, which we determined to be remote.

and fiber operating leases that have not yet commenced. We have legally obligated lease payments for various other operating leases that have not yet commenced for which
the total obligation was not significant. We have certain rights and obligations for these leases, but have not recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset or an operating
lease liability since they have not yet commenced.
Real Estate Transaction
On July 23, 2019, Verizon completed a sale-leaseback transaction for buildings and real estate. We received total gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. We leased
back a portion of the build ings and real estate sold and accounted for it as an operating lease. The term of the leaseback is for two years with four options to renew for an
additional three months each. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been classified in Other , net within Cash Flows from Investing Activities in our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net gain as a result of this transaction is included in the components of net lease cost table

During 2020,  we received $31.5 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $5.6 billion of proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions. The net
proceeds are a result of the liquidity strategy that we pursued at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemi c to maintain a higher cash balance in order to further protect the
Company against the econ omic uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and to opportunis tically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time when we
believed that market conditions were favorable. We used $17.2 billion of cash to repay , redeem and repurchase long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations,
including $7.4 billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term borrowings. The net proceeds from the green bond issued in 2020 are expected to be used to fund certain
renewable ener gy projects.
During 2019,  we received $18.7 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $8.6 billion of proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions. The net
proceeds were  used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt and the funding of certain eligible green projects. We used $23.9 billion of cash to repay ,
redeem and repurchase long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, including $6.3 billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term borrowings.(1)

Short-Term Borrowings and Commercial Paper Program
As of December 31, 2020, we had no short-term borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. In April 2020, we issued $3.5 billion in commercial paper , of which
$2.5 billion was repaid during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the remaining $1.0 billion was repaid during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These
transactions were recorded within Other , net cash flow from financing in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2020,  the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $10.6 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-
party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financin g Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed
debt bankrup tcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in
connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators)
transfer devic e payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon
entities retain  the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed  to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan
agreement receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and
expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our
asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations
are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recours e to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to
Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment
obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-ba cked debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt
issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
As mentioned above, holders of our asset-backed  debt do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of princ ipal and interest on the debt. However , if an
early amortization of our asset-backed debt occurs, including as a result of increased customer(1)

delinquencies or losses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, all collections on the securitized device paym ent plan agreement receivables would be used to pay principal and

 The one-month LIBOR at December 31, 2020 was 0.144%.
Under the terms of each series of ABS Notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . During the year
ended Decem ber 31, 2020, we made aggregate princ ipal repayments of $3.4 billion on ABS notes that have entered the amortization period, including principal payments
made in conn ection with clean-up redemptions. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we made aggregate principal repayments of $3.3 billion on ABS notes that had
entered the amortization period, including principal payments made in connection with clean-up redemptions. In January 2021, we made a principal payment of
$180 million in connection with a clean-up redemption.
ABS Financing Facility
In May 2020, we amended and restated our outstanding ABS financing facility originally entered into in 2016, and previously amended and restated in 2019, with a number
of finan cial institutions (ABS Financing Facility). Under the terms of the ABS Financing Facility , the financial institutions make advances under asset-backed loans backed
by device payment plan agreement receivables of both consumer and business customers. One loan agreement is outstanding in connection with the ABS Financing Facility ,
and such loan agreement was amended and restated in May 2020. The loan agreement has a final maturit y date in May 2024 and bears interest at floating rates. There is a
one year revolving period until May 2021, which may be extended with the approval of the financial institutions. Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all
or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subjec t to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the
ABS Entity. During 2020, we borrowed $1.3 billion and prepaid $4.0 billion under the loan agreement. The aggregate outstanding balance under the ABS Financing Facility
was $500 million as of December 31, 2020.
Variable Inter est Entities
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the
entity that most significantly impact the entity’ s perfo rmance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity . Therefore, the assets, liabilities
and activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.(1)

N/A - not applicable
 The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business
has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
 Durin g 2020  and 2019, we drew down $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion from these facilities, respectively . These credit facilities are used to finance equipment-related
purchases. Borrowings under certain of these facilitie s amortize semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates
of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed.
2021 Credit Agreement
Delayed Draw T erm Loan Cr edit Agr eement
On February 24, 2021 (the Effective Date), Verizon entered into a $25.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with two financial
institutions, which includes initial commitments of $12.5 billion from each of these parties. The Credit Agreement provides Verizon with the ability to borrow up to
$25.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including any potential acquisition of spectrum. The loans under the Credit Agreement are available during the period (the
Availability Period) beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier of (i) May 28, 2021, and (ii) the receipt by the two financial institutions of written notice by
Verizon of its election to terminate commitments pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The availability of the loans under the Credit Agreement, which have not yet been
funded, is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions that certain representations of Verizon are accurate in all material respects and the absence of certain event
of default. The loans under the Credit Agreement are to be made in a single borrowing on the funding date and will mature and be payable in full on the date that is 364 days
after the funding date unless extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The two financia l institutions may syndicate their commitments under the Credit
Agreement, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Interest Rate and Fees
The loans under the Credit  Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of Verizon, (i) the base rate (defined as the greater of the rate last quoted by the Wall
Street Journal as the "prime rate", the federal funds rate plus 0.500%, and one-month LIBOR plus 1.000% , subject to a floor of 1.000%) or (ii) LIBOR, in each case plus a
margin to be determined by reference to Verizon’ s credit ratings and ranging from 0.000% to 0.125% in the case of base rate loans and 0.625% to 1.125% in the case of
LIBOR loans. Additional mar gin of 0.125% is added to the loan on December 31, 2021.
Verizon will pay a commitment fee on the daily actual unused commitment of each lender starting on the date that is 60 days after the Effective Date through the last day of
the A vailability Period. This fee accrues at a rate determined by reference to V erizon’ s credit ratings and ranges from 0.070% to 0.125% per annum.
Prepayments
The Credit Agreement requires Verizon to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances or sales of equity
and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.(1)

Covenants and Events of Default
The Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes
covenant, and affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. An event of default may result in
the inability to borrow in certain circumstances or the acceleration of any outstanding loan under the Credit Agreement, as applicable.
Non-Cash Transactions
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $1.7 billion,
$563 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively , of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $1.6 billion and
$1.1 billion, respectively , relating to these financin g arrangements, including those entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained
outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentur es of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, $765 million aggregate principal amount of these obligations
remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company
no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
We also guara ntee the debt obligations of GTE LLC as successor in interest to GTE Corporation that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. As of December 31,
2020, $391 million aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Following the adoption of T opic 326 on January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost.
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate
service on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment
plan charge is included on their wireless monthly bill. We no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed -term, subsidized service plans for devices; however , we continue
to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. We also continue to service existing plans for custom ers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the
Verizon device payment program.(1)

Includes allow ance for both short-term and long-term  device payment plan agreement receivables. The allowance at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 relate to
our provision for credit losses and doubtful accounts, respectively .
Included in our device payment plan agreement recei vables, net at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $12.1
billion and $14.3 billion, respectively , which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 for additional
information. W e believe the carrying value of these receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.
For indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. W e record the imputed interest as
a reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interes t income, which is included within Service revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized
over the financed device payment term.
Promotions
We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the
customer receives a credit for the value of the trade -in device. In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future credits that will be applied against the
customer ’s monthly bill as long as service is maintain ed. We recognize a liability , measured at fair value, for the customer's right to trade-in the device which is determined
by considerin g several factors, including the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. Future credits are recognized
when earned by the customer . Device payment plan agreement receivables, net does not reflect the trade-i n device liability . At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
the amount of trade-in liability was $70 million and $103 million, respectively .
From time to time, we offer certain marketing promo tions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order . When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the
right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.
Origination of Device Payment Plan Agreements
When origina ting device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to
determine eligibility for the device payment program . Verizon’ s experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for
estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and
receivables due from custo mers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customer s that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of
this experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are "established customers" or "short-tenured customers." If a Consumer customer has
been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an "established customer ." For
established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has
been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a "short-tenured customer ." For short-
tenured customers, the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources.
Internal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for Consumer customers. The custom
credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’ s credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the
potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit
report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history . In those instances, alternative
credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of the business with external data sources.(1)

Table of Contents
Based on the custom credi t risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has specif ied offers of credit including an account level spending limit and
either a maximum amount of credit allowed per device or a required down payment percentage. During the fourth quarter 2018, we moved all Consumer customers, short-
tenured and established, from a required down payment percentage, between zero and 100%, to a maximum amount of credit per device.

Subsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two models, one for new customers and one for
existing custo mers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on 210 days and 12 months or less, respectively , as "new
customers." The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on 210 days and 12 months or more, respectively , as "existing
customers."
The following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2020, by credit quality indicator and year of origination:

 Includes accounts that have been suspended at a point in time.
The data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2020.
We assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables portfolio as one overall pool. As of December 31, 2020, wireless service receivables, at amortized
cost, originating in 2020 and 2019 were $5.3 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively .
Allowance for Credit Losses
The credit quality indicators are used in determining  the estimated amount and the timing of expected credit losses for the device payment plan agreement and wireless
service receivables portfolios.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment of receivables were as follows:

Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 940 $ 262 
 Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables.
We monitor delinquency and write-of f experience based on the quality of our device payment plan agreem ent and wireless service receivables portfolios. The extent of our
collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of our proprietary custom internal scoring models that analyze the customer ’s past
performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These custom scori ng models assess a number of variables, including origination
characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Since our customers’ behaviors may be impacted by general economic conditions, we analyzed whether
changes in macroeconomic conditions impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the
collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are
unpaid charges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’s due date. For wireless service receivables, an account is considered delinquent 34 days after the bill cycle
date. The risk class determines the speed and severity of the collections ef fort including initiatives taken to facilitate customer payment.
As of December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses considered the current and potential future impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic based on available
information to date. The impacts also include the Company's commitment to the FCC's "Keep Americans  Connected" pledge, through which we pledged to waive late fees
for, and not terminate service to, any of our consume r or small business customers who informed us that they had been impacted financially by the COVID-19 pandemic
through May 13, which we extended to June 30, 2020. Starting July 1, customers who had notified us that they had been financially impacted by the pandemic and had an
unpaid balance were automatically enrolled in our "Stay Connected" repayment program, which allows customers to pay off their service balance over six months and
extends any unpaid device payment plan agreements by the number of months unpaid.(1)

Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are measured at cost, less any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included
in Investment s in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020  and December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of our investments
without readi ly determinab le fair values were $402 million and $284 million, respectively . During 2020, there were approximately $101 million of fair value adjustments
due to observ able price changes and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were approximately
$81 million and insignificant, respectively .
Fixed income  securities consist primarily of investme nts in municipal bonds. For fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets, we use alternative
matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified
within Level 2. W e use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair V alue of Short-term and Long-term Debt
The fair value  of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted
prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement.
The fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows:

Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currenc y exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management
strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks,
interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. (1)  (2)  (3)

Forward starting interest rate swaps 2,000  3,000 
Interest rate caps — 679 
Foreign exchange forwards 1,405  1,130 
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are currently based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of
designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest
rate swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which are of fset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2020, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $10.2 billion and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $9.5 billion. During
2020, we received $764 million from the settlement of interest rate swaps, which was recorded in Other , net within Cash Flow from Operating Activities. During 2019, we
entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $510 million and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.3 billion.
The inef fective portion of these interest rate swaps was a gain of an insignificant amount and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively .
The following amounts were recorded in Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

At December 31, 2020 2019
Carrying amount of hedged liabilities $ 18,849  $ 17,337 
Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged liabilities 557 433 
Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment remaining for which hedge accounting has been discontinued 627 — 
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian
Dollar -denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or
losses.
During 2020, we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $4.8 billion and we settled cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $1.6 billion.
A pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion was recognized in Other comprehensive loss with respect to these swaps.
During 2019, we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $6.4 billion and did not settle any cross currency swaps. A pre-tax loss of $385 million was
recognized in Other comprehensive loss with respect to these swaps.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive loss was reclassified to Other income (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax foreign currency
transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Forward Starting Inter est Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions. W e hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance.
During 2020,  we did not enter into any forward starting interest rate swaps and we settled forward startin g interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.0 billion. A
pre-tax loss of $486 million, resulting from interest rate movements was recognized in Other comprehensive loss with respect to these swaps.
During 2019,  we did not enter into any forward starting interest rate swaps and we settled forward startin g interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.0 billion. A
pre-tax loss of $565 million, resulting from interest rate movements was recognized in Other comprehensive loss with respect to these swaps.

Treasury Rate Locks
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. During 2020, we entered into and settled treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges with a total
notional value of $5.5 billion, and we recognized an insignificant pre-tax loss in Other comprehensive loss. During 2019, we did not enter into or settle any treasury rate
locks designa ted as cash flow hedges, and we did not recognize any amount in our consolidated financial statements. In January and February 2021, we entered into treasury
rate locks with a total notional value of $4.3 billion.
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in
certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign  exchange rates. The notional amount of Euro-denom inated debt as a net investment hedge was €750 million as of both
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Inter est Rate Caps
We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interes t exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facilities and ABS Notes. During both 2020 and 2019, we
recognized insignificant pre-tax losses in Interest expense related to interest rate caps.
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries, as well as foreign exchange risk related to debt settlements. During 2020, we entered into foreign exchange
forwards with a total notional value of $14.0 billion and settled foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value of $13.8 billion. During 2019, we entered into foreign
exchange forw ards with a total notional value of $12.0 billion and settled foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value of $11.5 billion. During 2020, a pre-tax gain
of $142 million was recognized in Other income (expense), net. During 2019, a pre-tax loss of an insignificant amount was recognized in Other income (expense), net.
Treasury Rate Locks
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. During 2020, we entered into and settled  treasury rate locks with a total notional value of $1.6 billion, and
we recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain in Interest expense.
During 2019, we entered into treasury rate locks with a total notional value of $1.5 billion to hedge the tender offers conducted in May 2019 for fifteen series of notes issued
by Verizon with coupon rates ranging from 4.672% to 5.012% and maturity dates ranging from 2054 to 2055 (May Tender offers). In addition, we entered into treasury rate
locks with a total notional value of $1.5 billion to hedge the tender offers conducted in November and December 2019 for eleven and twenty series of notes and debentures,
respectively , issued by Verizon and other subsidiaries with coupon rates ranging from 3.850% to 8.950% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2055 (November and
December Tender offers). Upon the early settlement of the May, November and December Tender Offers, we settled these hedges and recognized an insignificant gain in
Other income (expense), net.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade
receivables, including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiat ed derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit
support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements conta in rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may
be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2020, we held $0.2 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral
exchange agreements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, we held an insignificant amount of
collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. While
we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonpe rformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would
result in a significant ef fect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.

Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan
In May 2017 , Verizon’ s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the
Verizon 2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the
granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of
the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining  but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding
awards under  the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 83 million
shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock
upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each
reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All
RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the
RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-bas ed program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time
employees who meet eligibility requirements on the annual grant date.
In February 2018, Verizon announced a broad-based employee special award of RSUs under the 2017 Plan to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These RSUs vested
in two equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date and paid in cash. The first installment of the restricted stock units vested and were paid in February 2019 and
the remaining restricted stock units vested and were paid in February 2020.
In conn ection with our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business, on the closing date of the Transaction each unvested and outstanding Yahoo RSU award that was held by
an employee who became an employee of Verizon was replaced with a Verizon RSU award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. These
awards are classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to
estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Performance Stock Units
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the
Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance
goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the
grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting perio d. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability
awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance
relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time that PSU award is determined and
paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.
The following table summarizes V erizon’ s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of Decem ber 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $881 million and is
expected to be recognized over approximately 2 years.
The equity awards granted in 2020 and 2019 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $57.38 and $56.66 per unit, respectively . During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid
$961 million, $737 million and $773 million, respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon was $780 million,
$872 million and $720 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively .
Note 11. Employee Benefits
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pensio n plans for certain employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain
retirees and their dependents, which are both contri butory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain current and future retirees. In
accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include service costs associated with pension and other
postretirement benefits while other credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and impact
from health care trend rates are reported in Other income (expense), net. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated
actuarial assumptions or upon a remeasurement event. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event
pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Pension and other postretir ement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to
time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan
assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively .
Actuarial Loss, Net
The net actuarial loss in 2020 is primarily the result of a $3.2 billion loss due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of
our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020.
The net actuarial loss in 2019 is primarily the result of a $4.3 billion loss due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of
our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 to a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019, partially
offset by other assumption adjustments of $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion related to healthcare claims experience.
Collective Bargaining Negotiations
The extension agreement ratified in August 2018 extended our collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that were due to expire on August 3, 2019 for four years until August 5, 2023. Amendments triggered by the collective bargaining
negotiations were made to certain pension plans for certain union-represented employees and retirees. The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined
benefit pension plans plan obligations and a net decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $230 million (net of taxes of $170 million). The annual impact of
the amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income that will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant.
The reclassifications from the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of collective bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in
2016 and 2017 resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax income of approximately $729 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018.

In determinin g our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.6% in 2020. The rates were selected to approximate
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at Dece mber 31, 2020. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided
with the time periods during which benefits payment s are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300
million par outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-
year period. Those estimat es are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and
historical long-term risk premiums. T o determine the aggregate return for the

pension trust, the projected  return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocati on to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation
policy .

Plan Assets
The Company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return.
While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 48% to 68% of the assets have the objective of
achieving a return in exces s of the growth in liabilitie s (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emer ging market debt)
and 35% to 55% of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest rate sensitivity of
the liability) and a maximu m of 15% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be
revisited perio dically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies
and various other factors. Due to our diversification  and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or
company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of
assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), prima rily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market
instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term
nature of these investments.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreig n securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if
no sales were  reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using
matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over -the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on
the last business day of the year from published sources or , if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-
party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund mana gers have the responsibility for providing this information to the
custodian of the respective plan.
94
Table of Contents
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limit ed partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at
amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investm ent manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable
data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are
based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuation, estimated fair values might differ significan tly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be
material.
Forward currency contract s, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year. Both
exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager . These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their
corresponding of fering or private placement memoranda.
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership investments for which
fair value is measured using the NA V per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total investments.
Employer Contributions
In 2020, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $57 million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans and $709 million of
contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans. No qualified pension plans contributions are expected to be made in 2021. Nonqualified pension plans contributions
are estimated to be approximately $70 million and contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $800 million in 2021.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:

2025 1,080  881 
2026 to 2030 5,253  4,437  
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares
of our common stock from  this ESOP . At December 31, 2020, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 46 million. There were no unallocated
shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2020. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $730 million in 2020, $897 million in 2019 and $1.1 billion in 2018.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Cr edits) Charges
During 2020, in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur , we recorded net pre-tax pension and
benefits charges of $1.6 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
income and were primarily  driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit
plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 ($3.2 billion), partially offset by the difference between
our estimated  return on assets and our actual return on assets ($1.6 billion). During 2020, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $309 million in Selling, general
and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2019, in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur , we recorded net pre-tax pension and
benefits charges of $126 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorde d in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
income and were primarily  driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit
plans from a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 to a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 ($4.3 billion), partially offset by the difference between
our estimated return on assets and our actual return on assets ($2.3 billion) and other assumption adjust ments of $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion related to healthcare
claims experience. During 2019, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $260 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statements of income.
During 2018, we recorded  net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the
period in which they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion, which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and
postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average  of 3.7% at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 ($2.6 billion), and mortality and
other assumption adjustments of $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of which related to healthcare claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estimated return
on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of (2.7)% ($1.9 billion). The credits were partially offset by $177 million due to the effect of participants retiring under the
Voluntary Separation Program.
In September  2018, Verizon announced a Voluntary Separation Program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 10,400 eligible employees separated
from the Company under this program as of the end of June 2019. The severance benefit payments to these employees were substantially completed by the end of September
2019. Princip ally as a result of this program but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives , the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion ($1.4
billion after-tax) during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income.
During 2018, we also recorded $339 million in severance costs under our other existing separation plans.

Effective income tax rate 23.4 % 13.0 % 18.3 %
The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.4% compared to 13.0% for 2019. The increase in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock representing a minority interest in a foreign af filiate in 2019
that did not reoccur in 2020.
The effective  income tax rate for 2019 was 13.0% compared to 18.3% for 2018. The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 billion non-recurring tax benefit in connection with the disposit ion of preferred stock representing a minority interest in a foreign
affiliate in 2019 compared  to the non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion, as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the
historical W ireless business, which was of fset by a goodwill char ge that is not deductible for tax purposes in 2018.

At December  31, 2020, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $5.0 billion. The majority of
Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to
repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in
reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictio nal requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred
taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in

funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December 31, 2020, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $2.8 billion that primarily relate to state and foreign
taxes. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $1.7 billion will expire between 2021 and 2040 and approximately $1.1 billion may be carried
forward indefinitely .
During 2020,  the valuation allowance decreased approximately $77 million. The $2.2 billion valuation allowance at December 31, 2020 as well as the 2020 activity is
primarily related to state and foreign taxes.

Verizon and/o r its subsidiaries file income tax return s in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are under
audit by the Internal Reve nue Service (IRS) and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open  tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’ s U.S.
income tax returns for tax years 2015-2016 and Cellco's U.S. income tax return for tax year 2017-2018. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2006. The
amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is
reasonably possible that various current tax examinat ions will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range
of the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.

Business Gr oupOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services,
corporate netw orking solut ions, security and manage d network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver
various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline
carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world.
Our Consume r segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us
on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’ s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small
and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other , and Wholesale.
Corporate and other includes the results of our media business, Verizon Media, and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate
expenses, certain pension and other employee benefi t related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested
businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded
from the business segmen t results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losse s from these transactions that are not individually significant are
included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
The reconciliation of segm ent operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that the chief
operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.

Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income
Equity
In December 2019, 46,100  preferred shares of a forei gn affiliate of Verizon was sold for cash consideration of $51 million and is reflected in non-controlling interests. The
preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25% per annum.
Common Stock
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . Durin g the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our current or previously
authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback
program was 100 million.

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2020,
2019, and 2018, we issued 2.3 million, 3.8 million and 3.5 million common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
In connection  with our acquisition of Straight Path in February 2018, we issued approximately 49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately $2.4
billion.

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involve d in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in
consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the
currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be
made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damag e theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record;
(3) uncertain ty concerning  legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We
continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed . We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending
regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given
reporting period.
Verizon is currently involv ed in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-
practicing entities and ef fectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that
103
Table of Contents
have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if
they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection  with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time,
counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Servi ces Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guara ntee to publish directories, which was issued when the directory
business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of
Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee,
which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcom es available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or
benefits that may of fset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of Decem ber 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling approximately $677 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
During 2020, Verizon entered into 12 renewable energy purchase agreements (REP As) with third parties. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a
renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected
to occur in 2021 through 2023, as applicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the
facilities.
We have various commitments, totaling $24.6 billion, primarily to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be used
or sold in the ordinary course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $8.2 billion is attributable to 2021, $10.8 billion is attributable to 2022 through
2023, $4.1 billion is attributable to 2024 through 2025 and $1.5 billion is attributable to years thereafter . These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in
the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancellable quantities or
termination amounts. Purchases against our commi tments totaled approximately $10.5 billion for 2020, $10.9 billion for 2019 and $9.0 billion for 2018. Since the
commitments to purchase programming services from  television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based
on number of subscribers at December 31, 2020, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with
no firm commitment.
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant
which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control
established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the regist rant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2020.
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are
intended to ensure an ef fective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning
(ERP) system , which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data
analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.
As the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our
internal contr ols over financial reporting. As such changes occur , we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’ s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Verizon’ s independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".

Interest on each series of Notes is payable annually in arrears and will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is
being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on such series (or the date of initial issuance of such series, if no
interest has been paid on such series), to but excluding the next scheduled interest
payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined by the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer payment system or any successor thereto is not open for transfer of payments, we will make the payment on the
next succeeding business day in such locations, and no additional interest will accrue as a result of the delay in payment. If interest or principal on any of the 4.073% 2024

Ranking
    Each series of Notes is unsecured and ranks equally with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Curr ency Conversion
    All payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any , including any payments made upon any redemption, on the Euro Notes will be payable in euro.
    All payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any , including any payments made upon any redemption, on the Sterling Notes will be payable in GBP .
    If either euro or GBP , as applicable, is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (including the dissolution of
the euro), then all payments in respect of the relevant Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until euro or GBP, as the case may be, is again available to us. The amount payable
on any date in euro or GBP, as applicable, will be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second
business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the latest U.S.
dollar/euro exchange rate or U.S. dollar/GBP exchange rate, as applicable, available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined
by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes alternatively made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture.

regulation or administrative interpretation would apply retroactively to such payment;
(vi)    any Tax that would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the presentation of such Note more than 30 days after the applicable payment
becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that such holder would have been entitled to such additional amounts
on presenting such Note for payment on the last date of such period of 30 days;
(vii)    any Tax that would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the failure of a direct or indirect holder or beneficial owner of such Note to comply

Book-Entry Only Form
Each series of Notes was issued in book-entry only form, which means that it is represented by one or more permanent global securities registered in the name of
The Depository T rust Company , New Y ork, New Y ork ("DTC"), or its nominee. W e refer to this form as "book-entry only ."
For debt securities issued in book-entry only form, DTC keeps a computerized record of its participants (for example, a broker) whose clients have purchased the
securities. Each participant then keeps a record of its clients who purchased the securities. A global securit y may not be transferred, except that DTC, its nominees and their
successors may transfer an entire global security to one another .
For book-entry only debt securities, we wire principal and interest payments to DTC’ s nominee. W e and the trustee treat DTC’ s nominee as the owner of the global
securities for all purposes.  Accordingly , neither we nor the trustee have any direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due on the debt securities issued under the
Indenture to owners of beneficial interests in the global securities.
Under book-entry only form, we have not issued physical certificates representing beneficial interests in the global securities to individual holders of the debt
securities. Beneficial interests in global securities will be shown on, and transfers of global securities will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and its
participants and will be exchangeable for debt securities in certificated form with the same terms in authorized denominations only if:
• DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository;
• DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor depository is not appointed by us within 90 days; or
• We instruct the trustee that the global security is exchangeable for debt securities in certificated form.
Liens on Assets
The Notes and other debt securities will not be secured. However , if at any time we mortgage, pledge or subject to any lien any of our property or assets, the
Indenture requires us to secure the Notes and other debt securities issued under the Indenture equally and ratably with the debt or obligations secured by such mortgage,
pledge or lien for as long as such debt or obligations remain secured. Exceptions to this requirement include the following:
• purchase-money mortgages or liens;
• liens on any property or asset that existed at the time when we acquired that property or asset;
• any deposit or pledge to secure public or statutory obligations;
• any deposit or pledge with any governmental agency required to qualify us to conduct any part of our business, to entitle us to maintain self-insurance or to obtain
the benefits of any law relating to workmen’ s compensation, unemployment insurance, old age pensions or other social security; or
• any deposit or pledge with any court, board, commission or governmental agency as security for the proper conduct of any proceeding before it.
The Indenture does not prevent any of our affiliates from mortgaging, pledging or subjecting to any lien, any property or asset, even if the affiliate acquired that
property or asset from us.
We may issue or assume an unlimited amount of debt under the Indenture.
Changes to the Indentur e
The Indenture may be changed with the consent of holders owning more than 50% of the principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series af fected
by the change. However , we may not change principal or interest payment terms of the Notes or the percentage required to change other terms of the Indenture without
consent of the holders of the Notes and the consent of others similarly af fected.
We may enter into supplemental indentures for other  specified purposes, including the creation of any new series of debt securities, without the consent of any
holder of debt securities issued under the Indenture.
Events of Default
An event of default means, for any series of debt securities issued under the Indenture, any of the following:
• failure to pay interest on that series of debt securities for 90 days after payment is due;
• failure to pay principal or any premium on that series of debt securities when due;
• failure to perform any other covenant relating to that series of debt securities for 90 days after notice to us;
• certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency and reor ganization; and
• any other event of default provided for in the supplem ent to the Indenture, board resolution or officers’ certificate designating the specific terms of such series of
debt securities.
An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily impact any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture.
If an event of default for any series of debt securities occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the
debt securities of such series may declare the entire principal of all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately . If this happens, subject to certain
conditions, the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the debt securities of that series can rescind the declaration if there has been deposited with the
trustee a sum suf ficient to pay all matured installments of interest, principal and any premium.
The holders of more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of any series of the debt securities, may, on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of
that series, control any proceedings resulting from an event of default or waive any past default except a default in the payment of principal, interest or any premium. We are
required to file an annual certificate with the trustee stating whether we are in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants under the Indenture.
Concerning the T rustee
Within 90 days after a default occurs with respect to a particular series of Notes, the trustee must notify the holders of such series of Notes of all defaults known to
the trustee if we have not remedied them (default is defined to mean any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an event of default with
respect to such series of Notes as specified above under "-Events of Default"). If a default described in the third bullet point under "-Events of Default" occurs, the trustee
will not give notice to the holders of the series until at
least 60 days after the occu rrence of that default. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the Notes of any default (except in the payment of principal, interest or
any premium) if it in good faith believes that withholding this notice is in the interest of the holders.
Prior to an event of default, the trustee is required to perform only the specific duties stated in the Indenture, and after an event of default, must exercise the same
degree of care as a prudent individual would exercise in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The trustee is not required to take any action permitted by the Indenture at the
request of holders of the debt securities, unless those holders protect the trustee against costs, expenses and liabilities. The trustee is not required to spend its own funds or
become financially liable when performing its duties if it reasonably believes that it will not be adequately protected financially .
U.S. Bank National Associ ation, the trustee for the Notes, and its affiliates have commercial banking relationships with us and some of our affiliates and serves as
trustee or paying agent under indentures relating to debt securities issued by us and some of our af filiates.
AUD Notes
The following description of the AUD Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the our
Note Deed Poll, dated July 28, 2017 (the “Deed Poll”)  and the terms of the global securities representing the AUD Notes.

We will pay interest on the AUD Notes in arrears at a rate of 3.50% per annum on the interest payment dates each year following the date of initial issuance, up to, and
including, the maturity date, to holders of record at 5:00 p.m. in the place where the register of noteholders is maintained on the record date immediately preceding such
interest paym ent date. If interest or principal on the AUD Notes is payable on a day that is not a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday , (ii) any day on which commercial
banks are not open for business in The City of New York or Sydney or (iii) if an AUD Note is to be held in a clearing system, any day on which any applicable clearing
system in which the relevant AUD Note is lodged is not operating (a “Business Day”), then we will make the payment on the next Business Day in such locations, and no
additional interest will accrue as a result of the delay in payment.
The AUD Notes are issued under our Deed Poll, in registered uncertificated form and shall be in denominations of A$10,000.
The AUD Notes are direct, unconditional, unsubordinated, unsecured and rank equally among themsel ves and with all of our other present and future unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations , save for such as may be preferred by mandatory provisions of applicable law. The Deed Poll does not limit the amount of debt securities that
may be issued and we may issue additional AUD Notes in the future.
Clearing Systems and Settlement
The AUD Notes are traded through Austraclear Ltd (ABN 94 002 060 773) (“Austraclear”) in accordan ce with the rules and regulations of the clearing and settlement
system operated by Austraclear in Australia (the “Austraclear System”). All AUD Notes held in the Austraclear System are registered in the name of Austraclear . If
Austraclear is recorded in the register as the holder of the AUD Notes, each person in whose security record (as defined in the Austraclear Regulations) an AUD Note is
recorded is taken to ackn owledge in favor of us, the registrar and Austraclear that (a) the registrar ’s decision to act as the registrar of that AUD Note is not a
recommendation or endorsement by the registrar or Austraclear in relation to that AUD Note, but only indicates that the registrar considers that the holding of the AUD Note
is compatible with the performance by it of its obligations as registrar and (b) the holder of the AUD Note does not rely on any fact, matter or circumstance contrary to this.
Transactions relating to interests in the AUD Notes may also be carried out through the clearing and settlement system operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) or
the clearing and settlement system operated by Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream, Luxembour g”). Interests in the AUD Notes traded in the Austraclear System may
be held for the benefit of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembour g. In these circumstances, entitlements in respect of holdings of interests in AUD Notes in Euroclear would
be held in the Austraclear System by a nominee of Euroclear (currently HSBC Custody Nominees (Austra lia) Limited) and entitlements in respect of holdings of interests in
AUD Notes in Clearstream , Luxembour g would be held in the Austraclear System by a nominee of Clearstream, Luxembour g (currently J.P. Morgan Nominees Australia
Pty Limited).
The rights of a holder of interests in an AUD Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembour g are subject to the respective rules and regulations for accountholders
of Euro clear and Clearstream, Luxembour g, the terms and conditions of agreements between Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembour g and their respective nominee and the
rules and regulations of the Austraclear System. In addition, any transfer of interests in an AUD Note, which is held through Euroc lear or Clearstream, Luxembour g will, to
the extent such transfer will be recorded on the Austraclear System, be subject to the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia (the “Corporations Act”) and the rules and
regulations of the Austraclear System. Furthermore, for the issue and transfer of any AUD Note within  Australia, the aggregate consideration payable must be at least
A$500,000 (or its equivalent in an alternative currency and, in either case, disregarding moneys lent by the offeror or its associate) or such issue and transfer must not
otherwise require disclosure to investors under Parts  6D.2 or 7.9 of the Corporations Act. For the issue and transfer of any AUD Note outside Australia, the aggregate
consideration payable must be at least A$200,000.
Curr ency Conversion
Payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, on the AUD Notes will be payable in Australian dollars (“AUD”). If a holder of an AUD Note receives an
amount other than in AUD, then it may convert the amount received into AUD (even though it may be necessary to convert through a third currency to do so) on the day and
at such rates (including spot rate, same day value rate or value tomorrow rate) as it reasonably considers appropriate. The holder of an AUD Note may deduct its usual costs
in connection  with the conversion. We satisfy our obligation to pay in AUD only to the extent of the amount of AUD obtained from the conversion after deducting the costs
of the conversion.
Redemption for T axation Reasons
The AUD Notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole but not in part, prior to their maturity date, at any time on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice
(which notice  shall be irrevocable), at their outstand ing principal amount as of the date of redemption, together with interest accrued to, but excluding, the date fixed for
redemption, if:
(i)    we have or will becom e obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to the AUD Notes as provide d or referred to under “Withholding Taxes” below as a result
of any change in or amend ment to the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof or
taxing authority therein or thereof affecting taxation, or any change in official position regarding applicat ion or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings
(including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States), or any other action taken by any taxing authority or a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States, whether or not such action was taken or made with respect to us, or any change, amendment, application or interpretation shall be
officially proposed, which becomes effective on or after November 6, 2019, and we, in our business judgment, determine that such obligation cannot be avoided
by us taking reasonable measures available to us;
provided that, we may only do so if:
(a)    prior to the publication of any notice of redemption for taxation reasons, we deliver to the registrar a certificate signed by two of our duly authorized officers
stating that we are entitled to effect such redemption for taxation reasons and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to
redeem have occurred and an opinion of independent legal advisers or tax consultants of recognized standing to the effect that we have or will, in all material
probability , become obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result of such change or amendment; and
(b)    we have given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days’ notice to the registrar , the holders of AUD Notes, each other Agent and any stock or securities
exchange or other relevant authority on which the AUD Notes are listed, quoted and/or traded; and
(c)    no notice of redemption is given earlier than 90 days before the earliest date on which we would be obliged to pay additional amounts.
Withholding T axes
If a law requi res us to withhold or deduct an amount in respect of taxes from a payment in respect of the AUD Notes such that the holder would not actually receive on the
due date the full amount provided for under the AUD Notes, then:
(i)    we agree to deduct the amount for the taxes (and any further withholding or deduction applicable to any further payment due under paragraph (ii) below); and
(ii)    if the amount deduc ted or withheld is in respe ct of taxes imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein or thereof
having power  to tax, we will pay such additional amounts so that, after making the deduction and further deductions applicable to additional amounts payable
under the AUD Notes, each holder that is not a U.S. Person (as defined below) is entitled to receive (at the time a payment is due) the amount it would have
received if no such deductions or withholdings had been required to be made.
For purposes of this section, the term “ U.S. Person ” means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, a
corporation, partnership or other entity created or or ganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, or any estate
or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source.
No additional amounts shall be payable on any AUD Note with respect to:
(a)    any taxes that woul d not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former conn ection between the holder of the AUD Note (or between a
fiduciary , settlor, beneficia ry of, or a person holding a power over, the holder , if the holder is an estate or trust, or a member or shareholder of the holder , if the
holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United States, including, without limitation, that holder (or that fiduciary , settlor , beneficiary , person holding a
power , member or shareho lder) being or having been a citizen, resident or treated as a resident of the United States or being or having been engaged in trade or

Tax Compliance Act (“F ATCA”).
Except as specifically provided in this section, we will not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax imposed by any government or any respective political
subdivision or any taxing authority therein or thereof, as a consequence of the initial issuance of AUD Notes.
Liens on Assets
If, at any time, we mortga ge, pledge or otherwise subject to any lien the whole or any part of any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by us, except as
provided in this section, we will accord the same security to any outstanding AUD Notes, and any other of our obligations which may then be outstanding and entitled to the
benefit of a covenant simil ar to this condition, equally and rateably with the indebtedness or obligations secured by such mortgage, pledge or lien, for as long as any such
indebtedness or obligation is so secured .
This condition does not apply to:

by us; or
b)    the making of any deposit or pledge

We may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition set forth in the first paragraph of this section (“Negative pledge”) if, before or after the
time for such compliance, the noteholders of more than 50% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of each applicable series of notes affected by the omission shall, in
each case by notice of such noteholders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive  compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver
shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, our obligations with respect to
any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and ef fect.
Changes to the T erms of the AUD Notes
The Deed Poll provides that certain matters require the unanimous consent of all holders of the AUD Note s including (i) a reduction in the principal amount, (ii) a change in
the maturity or (iii) reducing the interest rate. Any matter not requiring unanimous consent may be passe d by more than 50% of the votes cast at a meeting at which the
requisite quorum is present or without a meeting if holders of more than 50% of the outstanding principal  amount of the AUD Notes agree in writing. We may also amend
certain conditions of the AUD Notes without the consent of the holders, including if the amendment is administrative or technical, to comply with the law or to cure an
ambiguity .
Events of Default
An event of default means, with respect to the AUD Notes, any of the following:
• failure to pay interest on the AUD Notes for 90 days after payment is due;
• failure to pay principal or other redemption amount on the AUD Notes when due;
• failure to perform any other covenant or warranty for 90 days after notice to us; and
• certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency and reor ganization.
If an event of default (other than an event of bankruptcy , insolvency or reorganization) occurs with respect to the AUD Notes and is continuing, any holder of the AUD
Notes may, by written notice to us, declare such AUD Notes held by that holder to be immediately due and payable. Any notice given by a holder declaring the AUD Notes
due shall become effective , and all AUD Notes then outstanding shall become immediately due and paya ble at their redemption amount, together with accrued interest (if
any) to the date of repayment, when we have received such notices from holders holding not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the AUD Notes then
outstanding, unless, prior to the time we receive notice in respect of such aggregate amount, the situation giving rise to the notice has been cured.
At any time after a notice given by a holder as descri bed above becomes effective and before the situation giving rise to the notice has been cured or a judgement or decree
for payment of monies owing has been obtained, the notice may be rescinded and annulled by written notice to us from holders holding not less than 50% in aggregate
principal amount of the AUD Notes then outstanding, provided that:
(i)    we have paid to the holders of the AUD Notes all overdue interest on the AUD Notes and any related coupons, together with accrued interest (if any) and the
principal of the AUD Notes that have become due otherwise than by such notice described above, together with accrued interest (if any); and
(ii)    the situation giving rise to any other events of default with respect to the AUD Notes has been cured or waived by holders holding not less than 50% in
aggregate principal amount of the AUD Notes then outstanding.
If an event of default that is an event of bankruptcy , insolvency or reor ganization occurs, all AUD Notes then outstanding shall automatically , and without any declaration or
other action on the part of any holder or any other person, become immediately due and payable.
Notification
If an event of default (or, an event which, after notice and lapse of time, would become an event of default) occurs, we must within 90 days after becoming aware of it,
unless such default has been cured, notify the registrar of the occurrence of the event (specifying details of it) and use its reasonable endeavors to ensure that the registrar
promptly notifies, the relevant holders, each other agent and any stock or securities exchange or other relevant authority on which such AUD Notes are listed, quoted and/or
traded, provided that;
(i)    in the case of an even t of default due to our failure to pay interest on the AUD Notes for 90 days after payment is due or our failure to pay principal or other
redemption amount on the AUD Notes when due, we are not required to give notice if and so long as we in good faith determine that the withholding of
notice is in the interests of holders of the AUD Notes; and
(ii)    in the case of an event of default due to our failure to perform any other covenant for 90 days after notice to us, we are not to give notice until at least 60 days
after becoming aware of the event of default .
We must promptly notify the registrar once we have received notices from holders holding 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the AUD Notes then outstanding
and use our reasonable endeavors to ensure that the registrar promptly notifies the relevant holder , each other agent and any stock or securities exchange or other relevant
authority on which the AUD Notes are listed, quoted and/or traded of the occurrence of the event.
