PART IITEM 1.
BUSINESS GENERAL
Pfizer Inc. is a research
-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend andsignificantly improve their lives throu
gh the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines, vaccinesand medical devices, as 
well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across developed and emerging markets to advancewellness, prevention, treat
ments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments andlocal communities to 
support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and,to a much lesser extent, from al
liance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies. The majority of our revenues comefrom the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceut
ical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered 
into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated inIreland, under which we have agreed to 
combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value ofapproximately $160 bil
lion, based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to the announcement)and certain other assumptions. A
llergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares by virtue of a sharesplit, and Pfizer shareho
lders will have the option of receiving one share of the combined company for each of their Pfizer shares or receiving cash instead ofshares of the combined company for some o
r all of their Pfizer shares, provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in the merger will not be less than$6 billion or greater than $12 bi
llion. In the event that elections to receive cash and shares in the merger would otherwise result in an aggregate of less than $6billion or greater than $12 bi
llion of cash being paid out in the merger, then the share elections and cash elections will be subject to proration. The completion ofthe transaction, which is e
xpected in the second half of 2016, is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions,including the U.S. and EU, the 
receipt of necessary approvals from both Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and the completion of Allergan’s pending divestitureof its generics business to Te
va Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the businesses of Pfizer andAllergan will be combined under 
a single company and Pfizer would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan, which is organized under the laws of Irelandand which, subject to the approval b
y Allergan shareholders, will be renamed “Pfizer plc.” For further discussion on the pending Allergan combination, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope
rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Business section in our 2015 Financial Report . On September 3, 
2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, forapproximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash ac quired). Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospiraentities may be pending in var
ious jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps. For additional information, seethe Notes to Consolidat
ed Financial Statements— Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreemen ts, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-MethodInvestments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Acquisitions in our 2015 Financial Report. On June 24, 2013, we completed the full di
sposition of our Animal Health business. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements— 
Note 2D. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreemen ts, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment: Divestitures

rategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy andOutlook 
— Our Strategy and — Our Business Development I nitiatives sections in our 2015 Financial Report. Our businesses are heavil
y regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. TheFDA regulates the safety and efficac
y of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and productlabeling. Simi
lar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA regulates thescientific evaluat
ion, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of drugs for the EU and EEAcountries. In Japan
, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews andpharmaceutical safety. He
alth authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, such asthe FDA or EMA, before they begin to conduct the
ir application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constrain
ts below. Note:

COMMERCIAL OPERATIONSWe manage our commercial ope
rations through two distinct businesses: an Innovative Products business and an Established Products business. The InnovativeProducts business is co
mposed of two operating segments, each of which has been led by a single manager in 2015 and 2014 –– the Global InnovativePharmaceutical segment and the Globa
l Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment. Effective February 8, 2016, the Innovative Products businessis led by a single manager
. The Established Products business consists of the Global Established Pharmaceutical segment, which is also led by a singlemanager. Each oper
ating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additionalindications for in-
line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emergingmarkets.
Some additional informat
ion about each business and operating segment follows:Innovative Products Business
  Established Products Business Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment:
GIP focuses on dev
eloping and commercializingnovel, value-creating medicines
 that significantlyimprove patients’ lives. Key th
erapeutic areasinclude inflammation/immunology,
cardiovascular/metabolic, neur
oscience/painand rare diseases an
d include leading brands,such as 
Xeljanz , Eliquis , Lyrica  (U.S. and Japan), 
Enbrel  (outside the U.S. and Canada) and 
Viagra  (U.S. and Canada). Global Vaccines, Oncology and ConsumerHealthcare segment:
VOC focuses on the development and
commercialization of vaccines and
 products foroncology and consumer
 healthcare. ConsumerHealthcare manufactures
 and markets severalwell-known, over-the-counter (
OTC) products.Each of the three businesses in VO
C operatesas a separate, glo
bal business, with distinctspecialization in terms of th
e science andmarket approach nec
essary to deliver value toconsumers and patients.
 Global Established Pharmaceuticalsegment:
GEP includes legacy brands 
that have lost orwill soon lose market exclusivity in both
developed and emerging markets, branded
generics, generic sterile injecta
ble products,biosimilars and infusion systems.
We expect that the GIP and VOC biopharmaceut
ical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained byongoing investments to develop prom
ising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated productcandidates in areas of unmet medica
l need. The assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high level ofengagement with healthcare provide
rs and consumers.GEP is expected to generate strong cons
istent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. GEPleverages our biologic develo
pment, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, GEP leveragescapabilities in for
mulation development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. In addition, GEP may also engage intargeted business d
evelopment to further enable its commercial strategies. GEP has the knowledge and resources within R&D to develop small molecules,including injectables, and biosimilars. 
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, and its commercial operations are now included within GEP.For a further discussion of these operat
ing segments, see the Innovative Products and Established Products sections below and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Infor mation , including the tables therein captioned Selected Income Statement Information 
, Geographic Information and Significant Product Revenues , the table captioned Revenues by Segment and Geographic Area in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income 
section, and the Analysis of Operating Segm ent Information section in our 2015 Financial Report, which are incor porated byreference.
In addition, other
 business activities within Pfizer include Pfizer CentreSource, our contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemical sales operation,which in 2015 includes 
revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis Inc.Following the clos
ing of the pending combination with Allergan, the Vaccines and Oncology businesses are expected to be combined with the Global InnovativePharmaceutical busines
s and we expect to create a new global business, Global Specialty and Consumer Brands, that includes our Consumer Healthcarebusiness and Allergan’s oph
thalmology and aesthetics businesses, as well as Botox Therapeutic and Cosmetic. Allergan’s Anda distribution capabilities andbrands in women’s health 
and anti-infectives are expected to be combined with the Global Established Pharmaceutical business.Pfizer Inc.

ALLIANCE REVENUES
We are party to collaboration and/o

Rebif , each of which has expired or will expire in 2016 in certain markets. In addition, Eliquis was developed and is b eing commercialized in collaborationwith BMS. In April 2015, we sig
ned an agreement with BMS to transfer full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets to us, beginning in the thirdquarter of 2015. For additional informat

sections in our 2015 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors –– Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Innovation by our R&D organi
zation is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address majorunmet medical needs.
We conduct R&D internally and 
also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and incooperation with other
 pharmaceutical firms. Our WRD organization is generally responsible for research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved and then fortransitioning those projec
ts to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. The WRD organization also has responsibility forcertain science-based an
d other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects. WRD is alsoresponsible for facilitating all re
gulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 6
Our R&D primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular andmetabolic diseases; oncology
; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. Another area of focus is biosimilars. With the acquisition of Hospira, wehave expanded o
ur biosimilars pipeline and added R&D capabilities for sterile injectables and infusion systems.We also seek out promising c
hemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery anddevelopment processes or proje
cts, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations and alliance and license agreements with other companies, aswell as leveraging a
cquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds,technologies or capabilities. Collab
oration, alliance and license agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost, to accessexternal scientific and te
chnological expertise, and enable us to advance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.Drug discovery and develop
ment is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Benchmarking Forum, out of 20 compoundsentering preclinica
l development, only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market (U.S., the EU or Japan). The process from early discovery ordesign to development to regulatory appro
val can take more than ten years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may notreceive regulatory approva
l even after many years of research.As of February 2, 2016, we had the follow
ing number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound 
is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatoryapproval, new drug candidates enter
ing clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing newproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add 
value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential newindications for them.
Information concerning severa

Product Developments — Biopharmaceutical section in our 2015 Financial Report, which is incorpora ted by reference.Our competitors also devote substant
ial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developingpotential drug candidates. The extent to wh
ich our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products andpotential sales of products in de
velopment, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&Dexpenses and make a regular practi
ce of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A.Risk Factors 
— Competitive Products sections below. We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that
 will deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with thegreatest scientific and c
ommercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedicalcollaboration that will expedite

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSWe have significant operat
ions outside the U.S. Since 2014, operations in developed and emerging markets have been managed through our three operatingsegments: GIP, GEP and VOC. Emerg
ing markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizesthat the demographics and rising econo
mic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found withindeveloped markets.
Revenues from operations outside the 
U.S. of $27.1 billion accounted for 56% of our total revenues in 2015 . Japan is our largest national market outside theU.S. For a geographic breakdown of re
venues, see the table captioned Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolida ted Financial Statements— Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Informat

In our global biopharmaceutica
l businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain theapproved uses, benefits and risks of ou
r products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs thatprovide insurance coverage, su
ch as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOsto provide health benefits to their emp
loyees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates theapproved uses, benefits and risks of ou
r products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor generaladvertising to educate the public on d
isease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistance programs. For ourinfusion systems business, we 
promote directly to nurses, physicians, pharmacists, biomedical engineers, and their respective representatives.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 8
Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies andpharmacies, and, in t
he case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to individual provider offices, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention and wholesaler
s. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and MCO formularies, which are lists of approved medicinesavailable to members of the M
COs. MCOs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferredformulary positions. 
We also work with MCOs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatmentroutines.
In 2015, our top three biopharmaceutical 
wholesalers accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenues (and 74% of our total U.S. revenues).% of 2015 Total Revenues and U.S. Revenues f

Our global Consumer Healthcar
e business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors in smallermarkets. The advertising
 and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television, print, digital andother media advertising, as 
well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels, including distributors,pharmacies, retail chains an
d grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several largecustomers, the loss of any one of wh
ich could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business.PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the wor
ld under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of materialimportance to Pfizer. Trademar
k protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.Registrations generally are f
or fixed, but renewable, terms.We own or license a number of 
U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations,product manufacturing processes and 
intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.Patents for individual produ
cts extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countrieswhere patent protection is obtained. The actua
l protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, thescope of its coverage and the availab
ility of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries tocompensate for a regulatory delay 
in approval of the product. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints — IntellectualProperty 
below. In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of mater
ial importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current productsales, and considering the v
igorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our businessas a whole, togeth
er with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity periodand/or the granted patent term extension), are those for the med
icines set forth in the table below. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificatesand pediatric exclusi
vity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. Insome instances, there are later-e
xpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use ofthe drug in the treatment of particular d
iseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable,biosimilar compet
ition after the expiration of the basic patent.Pfizer Inc.

Revatio (which has the same active ingredient as Viagra ), expires in 2020. However, as a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. will be allowed to launch a generic version of 
Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, or earlier under certain circumstances. The corresponding method-of-treatment patent covering 
Viagra in Japan expired in May 2014. (2)

A number of our current products have exper
ienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. Foradditional information, 
including a description of certain of our co-promotion agreements and their expiration dates, and a further discussion of our productsexperiencing, or expected to exper

ment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — Intellectual Property Rights andCollaboration/Licensing Rights 
section in our 2015 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. Companies have filed appl
ications with the FDA seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering, among other products, Sutent , EpiPen 
, Toviaz , Tygacil extended-release capsules and Precedex Premix . For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A1. Commitments a
nd Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Patent Litigation in our 2015 Financial Report. The expiration of a basic product patent or 
loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from genericproducts against the original
ly patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In somecases, however, we can continue to obta
in commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processesand intermediates for the economica
l manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; andconversion of the active ingred
ient to OTC products.Pfizer Inc.

Biotechnology ProductsOur biotechnology pro
ducts, including BeneFIX , ReFacto , Xyntha and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face co mpetition in thefuture from biosimilars (also ref
erred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the U.S.Public Health Serv
ice Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product,Genotropin 
, which was approved un der the FFDCA.Biosimilars a
re versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and tohave no clinically meaningful diff
erences. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legalpathways for the approval of bios
imilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists inthe U.S. The regulatory imple
mentation of these ACA provisions is ongoing, and the FDA has issued draft guidance on subjects such as nonproprietary namingof biologic products and reference p
roduct exclusivity, and final guidance on a number of subjects such as scientific considerations in demonstratingbiosimilarity. Moreover, in 2015,
 the FDA approved the first biosimilar and currently has several other biosimilar applications under review. See Government Regulation and Price Constrain
ts — Biosimilar Regulation below for additional informa tion on the ACA’s approval framework for biosimilars.In Europe, the European Commiss
ion has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specificguidelines for biosi
milar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2013, the EMA approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody. In Japan, theregulatory authority h
as granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars, including our monoclonal antibody infliximab, pursuant to a guideline forbiosimilar approvals issued in 2009.
If competitors are able to obtain mar
keting approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products, our products may become subject to competitionfrom these biosimilars, with att
endant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rightscould trigger this competitio
n, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. However, biosimilar manufacturing is complex. At least initially uponapproval of a biosimilar compe
titor, biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to smallmolecule drugs.
As part of our business strategy, 
we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to developbiosimilar medicines. As such, a be
tter-defined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the U.S. SeeItem 1A. Risk Factors 
— Biotechnology Products below. We may face litigation 
with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products. Likewise, as we develop and manufacturebiosimilars and see
k to launch products, patents may be asserted against us.International
One of the main limitations on ou
r operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Underinternational and U.S. free trade agree
ments in recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving. For additional information, seeGovernment Regulation 
and Price Constraints — Intellectual Property below. COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in 
intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition inthe form of branded or generic drugs that treat s
imilar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and costeffectiveness. Though the means of competit
ion vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factorfor success in all of our 
principal businesses.Our competitors include o
ther worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus,generic and biosimi
lar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products thattreat diseases or indicatio
ns similar to those treated by our major products.This competition affects our co
re product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medicalneeds and provide 
therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our businessdevelopment transactions, both designed to 
result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue toinvest in further understanding the va
lue of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health andwell-being of patients by 
striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated topatients, physicians and globa
l health authorities. We also seek to continuallyPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 11
enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately andethically launch and promote ou
r products to our customers.Operating conditions have become mo
re challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue totake measures to evaluate, adapt and improve ou
r organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we havetaken an industry-leading ro
le in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals;and medical education grants. We a
lso continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamentalhealth system change through support for better hea
lthcare solutions.Our Consumer Healthcare bus
iness faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, andretailers who carry the
ir own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and ourcompetitors’ promotiona
l resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosageforms, or other forms of innovation; and p
ricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches).Our vaccines business ma
y face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition inthe form of alternative 13-valent or add
itional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adverselyaffect our future results.
Our generics and biosimilars busin
esses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. In the U.S.,Pfizer’s Greenstone subsidiary 
and Pfizer Injectables team sell generic versions of Pfizer’s, as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectablepharmaceutical products,
 respectively, upon loss of exclusivity, as appropriate. Additionally, as a result of the Hospira acquisition, Pfizer also sells genericversions of sterile injectable pr
oducts as well as biosimilars globally. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market positionfor our generic injectable
 drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market” position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and alsomay provide us with a perio
d of exclusivity as the only generic or biosimilar provider.Our infusion systems bus
iness faces competition from companies that manufacture and distribute similar products to our infusion systems. For our infusionsystems business, we see
k to differentiate our products through technological innovation and an integrated approach to drug delivery.Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. ha
s been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 283 million peoplein the U.S. now have some form of hea
lth insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Government Regulation and PriceConstraints 
— In the United States below), the marketing of presc ription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in theU.S. continues to grow in
 importance.The influence of MCOs has inc
reased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, thoseorganizations have been consol
idating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance toPfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased p
ressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcareexpenditures. MCOs typically ne
gotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to membersof the MCOs), clinica
l protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one ormore generic products before perm
itting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and marketshare of prescription drugs. In add
ition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs tran
sfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especiallyfor chronic treatments. This f
inancial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs.Due to their generally lower c
ost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered byformularies can vary con
siderably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particularmedical problems.
Exclusion of a product from a for
mulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population.Consequently, pharmaceutica
l companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, betterpatient ease of use, or fewer side effects, a
re generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an importantfactor. We have been generally, although not
Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 12
universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the highertiers or in a non-preferred status.
MCOs also emphasize pr
imary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to managecosts. Hospitalizat
ion and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the needfor hospitalization, profes
sional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.The ACA has accelerated
 payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality whilereducing costs, which c
reates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes.Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive chal
lenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patentprotection for a product, especial
ly a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Severalsuch competitors make a regula
r practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Unlike us, generic competitors often operate without largeR&D expenses, as wel
l as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval processexempts generics from cost
ly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety andefficacy data of the innovator product. Gener
ic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our productafter the expiration or loss of our patent and often 
charge much less.In addition, our patent-protected products can face 
competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.As noted above, MCOs that focus prima
rily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage theuse of generics as alt
ernatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in somecases require, pharmacist
s to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically andtherapeutically equiva
lent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our 
businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials areavailable from multiple sources. No
 serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2015 , and none are expected in 2016 . We have successfully secured the 
materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been short-term imbalances between supply and demand, butgenerally at higher prices 
than those historically paid.GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical and medical d
evice companies are subject to extensive laws and regulations by national, state and local agencies in the countries in which theydo business. Certain laws an
d regulations that govern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.General 
. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, includingthose governing the manufacture and marketing of ou
r products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmentalbodies. For additional infor
mation on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedin
gs in our 2015 Financial Rep ort. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls orseizures, as well as limitations on o
ur ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions.In the United States
Drug Regulation 
. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, including regulations thatgovern the testing, manufacturing, safety, eff
icacy, labeling and storage of our products, record keeping, advertising and promotion. Our products are alsosubject to post-market
 surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and itsimplementing regulations with res
pect to biologics. The FDA also regulates our Consumer Healthcare products.Other U.S. federal agencies, in
cluding the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The FTC has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumerhealthcare products, includ
ing OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 13
Before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic. The steps requiredbefore the FDA will approve
 an NDA or BLA generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor;sponsor submission of the appl
ication to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’sinspection of the f
acilities where the product will be manufactured.Before a generic dru
g may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an ANDA. The ANDA review process typically does not require new preclinical andclinical studie
s, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the NDAprocess. The ANDA proces
s, however, does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent tothe previously approved referenced b
rand drug, submission of an application to the FDA for review, and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the productwill be manufactured.
As a condition of product approval, the F
DA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, and surveillanceprograms to monitor the effect of the approved product. The F
DA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market studies andprograms. Any modifications 
to a drug or biologic, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require thesubmission and approval of a ne
w or supplemental NDA or BLA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional dataor conduct additional 
preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation bythe FDA, including record
keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to cGMPs, which regulate allaspects of the manufacturing process. 
We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics,including, but not limited 
to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirementsgoverning the manu
facture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls orseizures, injunctions, fines, civil pe
nalties and/or criminal prosecution.Biosimilar Regulation. 
The ACA created a fr amework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years ofexclusivity for the innovator
 biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four yearsafter the approval of the reference, innovator b
iologic.The FDA is responsible fo
r implementation of the legislation and, in 2015, approved the first biosimilar. Through that approval and the issuance of draft and finalguidance, the FDA has begun to address open question
s about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a non-U.S.-licensed comparatorto demonstrate biosimilarity a
nd/or interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Over the next several years, the FDA is expected to issueadditional draft and
 final guidance documents impacting biosimilars.Device Regulation 
. In the U.S., the FDA regulates medical devices under the authority of the FFDCA and its regulations. The FDA classifies U.S. medicaldevices into one of three classe
s (Class I, II or III) based on the statutory framework described in the FFDCA. Our medical device business includes Class I andII devices, which are reviewed
 by the FDA under the 510(k) process.During the 510(k) process, the F
DA reviews a premarket notification and determines whether or not a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to “predicatedevices.” If the intended use and technolog
ical characteristics are comparable to a predicate device, the device may be cleared for marketing. If the device hasthe same intended use as a predicate devi
ce and different technological characteristics, but data is submitted to the FDA showing that the device is at least assafe and effective as the legally 
marketed device, it may also be cleared for marketing. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additionalinformation, including 
clinical data. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or thatwould constitute a major change 
in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require Premarket Approval. The FDA requires each manufacturerto make this determination in the f
irst instance, but the agency can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek anew 510(k) clearance, the agency ma
y retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval. The FDA can also require themanufacturer to cease marketing and/or re
call the modified device until 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval is obtained. Additionally, the manufacturer maybe subject to significant regu
latory fines or penalties.Postmarket Device Regulation. 
The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other regulatoryauthorities. The FDA revie
ws design, manufacturing, and distribution practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverseexperience and oth
er information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Among other FDA requirements, we must comply with FDAregulations relating to cGM
Ps. These regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging andservicing of all finished medical devices
 intended for human use. We must also comply with Medical Devices Reporting which requires us to report to the FDAany incident in any of our products that 
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or required an unnecessary intervention for a patient, or inwhich any of our products malfun
ctioned and, if such malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling,advertising, and promo
tional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the FTC. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibitsthe marketing of approved medical de
vices for unapproved uses. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDAPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 14
and other regulatory authorities for compliance with Quality System Regulation and Medical Devices Reporting requirements, as well as other applicableregulations. If the FDA were to con
clude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective orpose an unreasonable health risk, the F
DA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair,replacement, or refund of such device
s, and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harmto the public health
. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, andassess civil or criminal fines and pen
alties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice.Sales and Marketing 
. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical and medical device companies are generally subject to various federal and statehealthcare laws that are intended to pre
vent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These lawsinclude anti-kickback laws and false
 claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting, offering,receiving, or paying any r
emuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibitanyone from knowingly an
d willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payers(including Medicare and 
Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there maynot be regulations, guidance or court dec
isions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical andmedical device companies. Violations
 of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal health careprograms (including Med
icare and Medicaid). The federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practicesof pharmaceutical or me
dical device companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers;require disclosure to the federa
l or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many ofthese laws and regulatio
ns contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and theirimplementation, our activ
ities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.Pricing and Reimbursement 
. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebateson purchases of pharmaceutical produ
cts under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceilingprice” drug pricing prog
ram, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agenciesunder healthcare programs, such as the Med
icaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported arecomplex and the failure to report pr
ices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income 
— Revenues — Overview section in our 2015 Financia l Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 1G. Basis of Presentation an
d Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2015 Financial Report, which are incorporated byreference.
Government and private third-party pa
yers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states usepreferred drug lists to restr
ict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products in certain states. As anotherexample, access to our products under the 
Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for Medicaidrecipients contracting for the p
rovision of services in the state. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states areconsidering a variety of co
st-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments.Healthcare Reform. 
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pa ss legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2010, theU.S. Congress enacted the ACA, 
which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, such as:•
increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs andextending those rebates to Medicaid managed 
care;•
requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drugcosts cause the beneficiarie
s to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap;•
imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, includingMedicare and Medicaid; and
•
imposing an annual excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices offered for sale in the U.S.The ACA included provisions desig
ned to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required mostindividuals to mainta
in health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaidcoverage to additional indi
viduals. The implementation of the coverage expansion had a negligible impact on Pfizer’s 2015 revenues.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 15
Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or otherpricing restrict
ions. A number of the candidates for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections have introduced such policy proposals, and a November 2015 U.S.Department of Health and Human Ser
vices forum dedicated to drug pricing could lead to further proposals. We believe medicines are the most efficient andeffective use of healthcare dolla
rs based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We continue to work with stakeholders in an effort to ensureaccess to medicines w
ithin an efficient and affordable healthcare system. In addition, certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect Pfizer'sobligations under the Medica
id drug rebate program, but the impact of those changes is not yet known.Adoption of other new legislat
ion at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreigngovernment official, government 
staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPAincludes interactions with certain
 healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.Individual states, acting through the
ir attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under stateconsumer protection a
nd false advertising laws.Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most other countries.New Drug Approvals and Pharmac
ovigilance. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be a chieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the DecentralizedProcedure or the EU Central
ized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the EEA countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Theuse of these procedures generally pro
vides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the Member States than was the case when the approvalprocesses were operating independent
ly within each country.In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry fo
r businesses looking to sell drugs and medical devices in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range ofregulatory activities, including clinical stu
dies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drugproduct may be marketed in Japan. The PM
DA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices and provides advice on productclassifications and approvals.
Health authorities in man
y middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of theFDA or the EMA) before
 they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical datain the country’s population 
in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S.and Europe.
China’s regulatory system is uniqu
e in many ways, and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with U.S. or otherinternational standards. It is 
common to see treatments entering the Chinese market two to five years behind first marketing in the U.S. and Europe, becauseChina only issues 
import drug licenses to treatments approved by a foreign regulatory authority. In addition, to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs inChina, a clinical trial authorization issu
ed by the CFDA is required for the conduct of Phase I to III clinical trials. Foreign applicants of imported drugs, if includingChina-originated data in 
their Multi-Regional Clinical Trials and meeting the relevant technical review requirements, may receive case-by-case clinical trialwaivers. Generics, on the other hand, on
ly need to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA. A Chinese drug license will only begranted if, following rev
iew, the CFDA determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness.In 2012, new ph
armacovigilance legislation came into force in the EU. Key changes include the establishment of a new Pharmacovigilance Risk AssessmentCommittee within the EMA, with res
ponsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. It also introduces thepossibility for regu
lators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards inlight of scientific de
velopments. There are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outsidedeveloped markets such as the EU and 
Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive.Medical Device Regulation. 
The EU has adopte d the European Medical Device Directives as a common legal framework for all EU Member States. Thesedirectives require companies t
hat wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system and safetyrequirements and obtain a “CE” 
marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the EEA) for their products. The applicableauthorities of the EU countrie
s, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, are responsible for market surveillance of products once theyare placed on the market. We are requi
red to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Variouspenalties exist for non-c
ompliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Directives.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 16
Medical device laws and regulations similar to those described above are also in effect in many of the other countries/regions in which we distribute our medicaldevice products.
Pricing and Reimbursement 
. In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada, and South Korea, governments provide healthcare at lowdirect cost to consumers and regu
late pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system,particularly under recent g
lobal economic pressures. Governments, including the different EU Member States, may use a variety of cost-containment measuresfor our pharmaceutical products, 
including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of manycountries linking the
ir regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditionsand assessments of value across 
countries has led to different prices in different countries and some third-party trade in our products between countries.In particular, internationa
l reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Pricevariations also have resu
lted from exchange rate fluctuations that are exacerbated by international reference pricing systems. The downward pricing pressureresulting from this dynam
ic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies, emergency measures targetingpharmaceuticals in some 
European countries and ongoing exchange rate fluctuations.China historically controlled prices of 
pharmaceutical products mainly by setting their maximum retail prices. Since June 1, 2015, government-set price capshave been lifted for the vast major
ity of drug products. However, the government will continue to exercise indirect price control by setting reasonablereimbursement standards determ
ined by the social insurance administrations, through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and socialinsurance administrations.
EU Regulatory Changes 
. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect by December 2017. This newregulation is aimed at simplifying 
and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results.In another eff
ort to increase the public availability of clinical trial results, the EMA adopted a new policy on Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products forHuman Use, which became ef
fective January 1, 2015. Under this policy, the EMA will proactively publish clinical trial data from application dossiers for newmarketing authorizations, 
including data from trials taking place outside the EU, after the EMA has made a decision on the marketing authorization. The policyincludes limited exceptions for c
ommercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data.China Regulatory Changes 
. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce the existing drug approval backlogs, the CFDA unveiled several reforminitiatives for Ch
ina’s drug approval system. The regulator now divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from “drugsnever marketed in China” to “d
rugs that are neither marketed in or outside China.” This change in definition creates more incentives for China’s domestic drugmanufacturers than for multinationa
l firms, because imported drugs first marketed outside China are no longer considered new drugs. Another major initiative isthe piloting of the “marketing author
ization holder” system in ten provinces in China, where the market authorization/drug license holders are no longer requiredto be the actu
al manufacturers. The “marketing authorization holder” system will allow for more flexibilities in contract manufacturing arrangements and assettransfers, but it is not appli
cable to imported drugs.A number of other policy changes are e
xpected to be able to streamline and accelerate domestic and imported drug approvals in China. These changes includeintroducing an umbrella clinical trial a
uthorization for all three phases of registration studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), implementing afiling/recordation sy
stem for bioequivalence studies on generics (instead of the original review and approval system), and admitting more types of drugs asinnovative drugs elig
ible for the fast track/green channel approval pathway.Healthcare Provider Transpar
ency and Disclosures. A number of countries  have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended)disclosure of transfers of va
lue made by pharmaceutical and medical device companies to healthcare providers. For example, in 2013, the EFPIA released itsdisclosure code of trans
fers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations. The code requires all members of EFPIA, including Pfizer, to disclosetransfers of value to healthcare profes
sionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016, covering the relevant transfers in 2015.Intellectual Property 
. The WTO-TRIPS required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceuticalproducts by 2005, with an extension unt
il 2033 for least-developed countries. While we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual propertychallenges around the world, a numbe
r of countries have made improvements. We include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider forcontinued business expansion 
in other participant countries.While the global intellectual pro
perty environment has improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growthdepends on further progress in intel
lectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policiesas a tool for reducin
g the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. There is considerable political and economicpressure to weaken existing 
intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies suchPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 17
as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions (e.g.,new medical treatment methods), 
revocation of patents, issuance of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implementeffective regulatory data protection. Ou
r industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers, as well ason underscoring the
 importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries.Canada’s intellectua
l property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), butit lacks the predictabi
lity and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU ComprehensiveEconomic & Trade Agreement, Canad
ian authorities committed to introduce a right of appeal, a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current dataprotection to a treaty obligation, furthe
r aligning its intellectual property regime to the EU. Canada is also signatory of the 2015 Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership(TPP), and Canada may enhance its 
intellectual property regime in line with its TPP obligations. The patent utility doctrine developed by the Canadian courtsremains an important concern 
which is currently not being addressed by the Canadian government.In China, the intellectual p
roperty environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. Thegovernment has tak
en steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, includingPfizer, have established R&D ce
nters in China due to increased confidence in China’s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on theU.S. Trade Representative’
s Priority Watch List for 2015. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets,including the U.S., Europe and Japan. 
Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking orinconsistent. For example, the absen
ce of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightenedsufficiency standards have been used to 
invalidate patents at the enforcement stage.In Brazil and other L
atin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil),restrictive patentabil
ity rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products throughpatents. The lack of regulatory data protect
ion and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit thecommercial lifespan of some p
harmaceutical products.In India, policies favor
ing compulsory licensing of patents, the increasing tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in oppositionproceedings, and restricti
ve standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions. India maintains asystem of pre-grant patent oppositions that de
lays the granting of patents and adds an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents.Indian law includes spe
cial restrictions on the types of pharmaceutical inventions that may be patented which may limit our ability to protect our products. Recentuse by the Indian government of compulsor
y licensing and patent revocation mechanisms heightens the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovativepharmaceutical products, espec
ially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population, such as infectious diseases, cancer anddiabetes. In September 2012, Pfizer’
s patent covering Sutent was revoked by the Indian Patent Office and othe r challenges against Pfizer patents are ongoing.In South Korea, the laws and regulation
s for the patent-regulatory approval linkage system was implemented as part of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement in2012. The Korean patent-regulatory approval 
linkage system includes biologics.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by nationa
l, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expendituresnecessary for compliance with 
applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notesto Consolidated Financial St
atements— Note 17A3. Commitments a nd Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Commercial and Other Matters in our 2015 Financial Report. As a re
sult, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2015 for environmental compl iance purposes and for the clean-up of certainpast industrial activity as follows:
•
environment-related capital expenditures— $23 million; and•
other environment-related expenses— $144 million.While capital expenditures or 
operating costs for environmental compliance, including compliance with laws related to climate change, cannot be predicted withcertainty, we do not
 currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.Climate change presents r
isks to our operations, including potential physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to more frequent and severe weatherevents and water availabi
lity. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future;however, we have a robust program for 
reviewing our vulnerability to these potential risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we haveconcluded that, because of
Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 18
our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the nearterm.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS 
: MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Consolidation among MCOs has
 increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private insurers. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments,increasingly employ formularies to c
ontrol costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricingor formulary placement for our p
roducts or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. In addition to formularytier co-pay differentials, 
private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularlyfor branded pharmaceuticals and biote
chnology products. This cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices, as they pay for a largerportion of their prescript
ion costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Private health insurancecompanies also are increasingly imp
osing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a genericproduct is available or 
requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. payermarket concentrates further and as more drug
s become available in generic form, biopharmaceuticalPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 20
companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost genericalternatives.
GENERIC COMPETITION
Competition from manufacturer
s of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectualproperty rights can have a sign
ificant adverse effect on our revenues. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that thepatent or regulatory exclusi
vity expires. However, upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despitepending patent infringement lit
igation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, we can losethe major portion of revenues for that product 
in a very short period of time, which can adversely affect our business. A number of our current Innovativeproducts are expected to face signif
icantly increased generic competition over the next few years.Also, the patents c
overing several of our medicines, including Sutent , EpiPen , Toviaz , Tygacil extended-release capsules and Precedex Premix in the U.S. are being challenged by generic manufa
cturers. Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents coveringseveral of their products that may 
impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such products. In addition, our patent-protected products may face competition inthe form of gen
eric versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
We cannot predict with accu
racy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products, including new product entrants, in-line branded products,generic products, private labe
l products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drugcandidates. The introduction of compet
itive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, aswell as unanticipated produ
ct obsolescence. Products that compete with ours, including some of our best-selling medicines, are launched from time to time.Competitive product launche
s have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development, some of whichhave been filed for approval w
ith the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.We also produce generic 
and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generic and biosimilarmanufacturers. The
 ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before generic or biosimilar market formation is important to thatproduct’s profitability. Prices for
 products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following market formation, as additional companies receive approvals tomarket that product and competition inten
sifies. If a company can be “first-to-market” such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period oftime, higher levels of sales 
and profitability can be achieved until other competitors enter the market. With increasing competition in the generic or biosimilarproduct market, th
e timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance. If we are unable to bring our generic orbiosimilar products to market 
on a timely basis, and secure “first-to-market” positions, our sales and profit opportunities could be adversely impacted.DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS
We recorded direct product revenue
s of more than $1 billion for each of seven biopharmaceutical products: Prevnar/Prevenar 13 , Lyrica , Enbrel , Lipitor , Viagra 
, Sutent and the Premarin family of products, as well as  more than $1 billion in Alliance revenues (primarily Eliquis ) in 2015. Those products and Alliancerevenues accounted for 
44% of our total revenues in 2015. If these products or an y of our other major products were to become subject to problems such asloss of patent protection (if appl
icable), changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings,publicity affecting doctor o
r patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling or, if a new, more effective treatment should beintroduced, the a
dverse impact on our revenues could be significant. Patents covering several of our best-selling medicines have recently expired or will expirein the next few years
 (including some of our billion-dollar and previously billion-dollar products), and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicines are,or have been, the subject of pending legal cha
llenges. For example, in December 2014, generic versions of Celebrex became available pursuan t to settlementagreements with several gener
ic manufacturers. In addition, our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance ofkey new products. For additiona

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTThe discovery and development of safe, effect
ive new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for thecontinued strength of our businesses. Our p
roduct lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their marketexclusivity, as 
well as to provide for earnings growth. Our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or newindications for exist
ing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal R&D or throughcollaborations, acquis
itions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. However, balancing current growth, investment for the future andthe delivery of shareholder retu
rn remains a major challenge. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in R&D for new products and existingproduct extensions could exceed co
rresponding sales growth.Additionally, our R
&D investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technologyplatforms, therapeutic segments, produ
ct classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipelinecould adversely impact the p
roductivity of our pipeline. Further, even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the science may not workfor any given program despite the s
ignificant investment required for R&D, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expectedbecause of the highly dynamic ma
rket environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that 
will deliver value in the near term and over time. There can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result, whichcould affect profita
bility in the future.BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Abbreviated legal pathways
 for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA, a framework for suchapproval exists in the U.
S. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products, our biotechnologyproducts may become subject to compet
ition from biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. The expiration orsuccessful challenge of a
pplicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period that has expired. We may face litigationwith respect to the valid
ity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products.We are developing biosimilar medicines.
 The evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the FDA and regulatory authorities incertain other countries
 could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars. Other risks related to our development of biosimilars includethe potential for steeper than anticipated pr
ice erosion due to increased competitive intensity, coupled with high costs associated with clinical development orintellectual property challeng
es that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products. There is also a risk of lower prescriptions ofbiosimilars due to potential c
oncerns over comparability with innovator medicines.RESEARCH STUDIES
Decisions about research 
studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payerreimbursement possibi
lities once the drug receives regulatory approval. For example, more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indicationsthat may impact the marketing and payer 
reimbursement process, but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required todemonstrate benefit and the potential delays to app
roval of the primary indication. We try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and addresschallenges, but there is no guarantee that an opti
mal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time. The degree towhich these challenges are fo
reseen and addressed could affect our future results.RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our international operations cou
ld be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions,changes in intellectual p
roperty legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, andmarketing of, reimbursement for and a
ccess to our products, as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmentaldisputes. Any of these changes could adve
rsely affect our business.Many emerging markets have exper
ienced growth rates in excess of developed markets, leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s globalperformance. As a result, we have been e
mploying strategies to grow in emerging markets, including the full integration of emerging markets into each of ourthree operating segments: GIP, VOC and GEP. 
However, there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that thesecountries will continue to sust
ain these growth rates. In addition, some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial orpolitical instability or significant currency 
fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending, which, as discussed above, can adversely affect ourresults.

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALSSpecialty pharmaceuticals are m
edicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations. The growing availability anduse of innovative specialt
y pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, has generatedpayer interest in developing 
cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. While the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialtypharmaceuticals has had l
imited impact on Pfizer to date, a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given ourgrowing specialty bus
iness portfolio. These include the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world, U.S. PBMs seeking tonegotiate greater discounts, deteriorat
ing finances of certain governments and the uptake of biosimilars as they become available.CONSUMER HEALTHCARE
The Consumer Healthcare bus
iness may be impacted by economic volatility, the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, generic or store brandcompetition affecting consumer 
spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands. In addition, regulatory andlegislative outcomes regarding
 the safety, efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our Consumer Healthcare products may require withdrawal,reformulation and/or relabel
ing of certain products (e.g., cough/cold products). See The Global Economic Environme nt risk factor below. PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS
Difficulties or delays in product m
anufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays, withdrawals,recalls, penalties, supply disrup
tions or shortages, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. Examples of such difficulties or delaysinclude, but are not limited to, the 
inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the failure to predict market demand for, or to gainmarket acceptance of, approved products; the poss
ibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality ofincoming materials 
may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal andexternal supply network a
nd/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as serialization (which allows for track and trace of products in thesupply chain to enhance patient safety); 
risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or man-made disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor,including those that may be related to 
climate change; or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such aseconomic adulteration, product d
iversion, product theft, and counterfeit goods.Regulatory agencies periodically insp
ect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with theserequirements may subject us to po
ssible legal or regulatory actions, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product.OUTSOURCING AND ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
We outsource certain services
 to third parties in areas including transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trialexecution, non-clinical research
, safety services and other areas. For example, in 2015, we placed the majority of our clinical trial execution services with fourstrategic Clinical Research Organizations
 (CROs). Service performance issues with these CROs may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trialprograms. Outsourcing 
of services to third parties could also expose us to sub-optimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, which may result in misseddeadlines or other timeliness
 issues, supply disruptions, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputationalharm, all with potential ne
gative implications for our results.We continue to pursu
e a multi-year initiative to outsource some transaction-processing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to aconsistent enterprise resour
ce planning system across the organization. These are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financialshared service capabil
ities and standardize our financial systems. If any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planningsystem were to occur, they cou
ld adversely affect our operations, including, among other ways, through a failure to meet demand for our products, or adverselyaffect our ability to m
eet our financial reporting obligations.COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collabo
rators, service providers, and others in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates andalso enter into joint ventures and othe
r business development transactions in connection with our business. To achieve expected longer term benefits, we maymake substantial upfro
nt payments in such transactions, which may negatively impact our reported earnings. We rely heavily on these parties for multipleaspects of our drug development and commer
cialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. Third parties may not completeactivities on schedule o
r in accordance with our expectations. Failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or otherobligations to Pfizer, or an
y disruption in the relationships between Pfizer and these third parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval orcommercializat
ion of our products and product candidates andPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 23
could also result in non-compliance or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business.DIFFICULTIES OF OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS
In 2015, our largest wholesale d
istributor accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenues (and 30% of our total U.S. revenues), and our top threewholesale distributo
rs accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenues (and 74% of our total U.S. revenues). If one of our significant wholesaledistributors should encounter f
inancial or other difficulties, such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us, and we might be unableto collect all the amounts that the d
istributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations.BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to continue to enhance our in-
line products and product pipeline through collaborations, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, equity- or debt-basedinvestments, 
mergers and acquisitions. However, these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities, competition fromother pharmaceutical companie
s that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including theability to satisfy the cond
itions to closing of announced transactions (including the pending combination with Allergan) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, andintegrate acquisitions. Furthe
r, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risksand liabilities that 
such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Additionally, we may not realize theanticipated benefits 
of such transactions, including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within theexpected time frame.
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
A counterfeit medicine i
s one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Pfizer medicine, therefore, is onemanufactured by someone other than Pfizer, but 
which appears to be the same as an authentic Pfizer medicine. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is asignificant and growing 
industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which hasgreatly facilitated the ease by 
which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticatedtechnology that makes it easier fo
r counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulatedwholesalers and repackager
s; the importation of medicines across borders; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters. Further, lawsagainst pharmaceutical counterfe
iting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Forexample, in some countries
, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in thedistribution of counterfeit med
icines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products.Counterfeit medicines pose a 
risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed,uninspected and unsanitary sites
—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines, which is exacerbatedby the complexity of the supply 
chain, could adversely impact our business, by, among other things, causing the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer nameand in the integrity 
of our medicines, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation.We undertake significant effort
s to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, including, among other things, working with the FDA and otherregulatory authorities and mu
ltinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecutecounterfeiters; assessing ne
w and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients andhealthcare providers to dist
inguish authentic from counterfeit medicines; implementing business practices designed to protect patient health; promoting publicpolicies intended to hind
er counterfeiting; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines; and working collaborativelywith wholesalers, pharmacies, cust
oms offices, and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improvesurveillance of dist
ributors and repackagers. No assurance can be given, however, that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful, and thepresence of counterfeit medicine
s may continue to increase.RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
: PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
U.S. and international governmenta
l regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business, and our futureresults could be adversel
y affected by changes in such regulations or policies.In the U.S., many of our products are subje
ct to increasing pricing pressures. Pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing is subject to enhancedgovernment and public scrutin
y and calls for reform. Some states have implemented, and otherPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 24
states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-controlregimes that would apply to broade
r segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasinglychallenge pharmaceutical a
nd medical device product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for ourproducts. Pricing pressures 
for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or throughgroup purchasing organizations, a
re seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.We encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most other countries. In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada andSouth Korea, governments provide health
care at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costsfor the government-sponsored healthcare s
ystem, and we have seen government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certainbiopharmaceutical products to 
control costs in those markets, particularly under recent global economic pressures. As a result, we expect that pressures on thepricing component of 
operating results will continue.The adoption of
 restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions, failure to obtain timely or adequate government-approved pricing or formula
ry placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adverselyimpact revenue. In 
our vaccines business, we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs. Failure tosecure participation in nat
ional immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business.U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM/HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION
The U.S. healthcare industry 
is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. For example, the ACA was enacted by Congress in March2010 and its provisions become effe
ctive on various dates. We expect that the rebates, discounts, taxes and other costs resulting from the ACA over time willhave a significant effect on our expense
s and profitability in the future. See the discussion under the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment,Strategy and Outlook 
— Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access — U.S. HealthcareLegislation 
section in our 2015 Financial Report and in Item 1. Business under the caption Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States . We also face the uncertainties that 
might result from any modification, repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the ACA. There is no assurance that theACA, as currently enacted or a
s amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal orstate legislative or adm
inistrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. In addition, certain regulatory changes to be implemented in2016 may affect Pfizer’s obl
igations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, but the impact of those changes is not yet known.Other U.S. federal or state legi
slative or regulatory action could adversely affect our business, including, among others, changes in patent laws, the importationof prescription drugs from outs
ide the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries, restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumeradvertising, lim
itations on interactions with healthcare professionals, or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in amanner that focuses primari
ly on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovativemedicines.
U.S. DEFICIT-REDUCTION ACTIONS
Any significant spending 
reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may beimplemented, and/or any signif
icant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverseimpact on our results o
f operations.SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION
We are subject to extensive, co
mplex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA and theDEA, and foreign regula
tory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminalprosecution, monetary
 penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension,revocation of approvals, or exc
lusion from future participation in government healthcare programs.DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our company. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing newproducts is inherently unce
rtain and involves a high degree of risk and cost. Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable.The process from early dis
covery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years. Drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of theprocess, including as the
 result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existingclinical data. There can 
be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical and clinical trial commencementPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 25
and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, or as to whether or when we will receive regulatoryapproval for new products or for ne
w indications or dosage forms for existing products, which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of thebenefit-risk profile 
suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredientsand other matters could adversely affe
ct the availability or commercial potential of our products. There is no assurance that we will be able to address thecomments in complete response 
letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the FDA, any of our late stagepipeline products will receive regulat
ory approval and/or be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets and/orbe commercially su
ccessful. There is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of ourregulatory compliance pro
cesses and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address futureregulatory agency findings, shou
ld they occur. In addition, there are risks associated with interim data, including the risk that final results of studies for whichinterim data have been provided and/or add
itional clinical trials may be different from (including less favorable than) the interim data results and may not supportfurther clinical deve
lopment of the applicable product candidate or indication.There are many considerations that can affe
ct the marketing of our products around the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to successfully complete oradequately design a
nd implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality, time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations,claims and concerns about safety and eff
icacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that canadversely affect the realizat
ion of R&D and product-related, forward-looking statements. Further, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in anegative impact on pr
oduct sales, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Increasing regulatoryscrutiny of drug safety and efficac
y, with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as they relate toalready-approved products, has resu
lted in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among other things,additional clinical trials prior to gran
ting approval or increased post-approval requirements, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.In addition, failure to put in pla
ce adequate controls and/or resources for effective collection, reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials andpost-marketing surveillance, in c
ompliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety, regulatory actions and risks toproduct sales.
The FDA, along with other regulato
ry agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications, which has delayed approvals ofnew generic products. These delay
s have become longer, and while the FDA has stated that it is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications,continued approval delays may be e
xperienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years.POST-APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting market
ing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in thesePhase 4 trials could resu
lt in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of aproduct. Regulatory agencies 
in countries outside the U.S. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies,whether conducted by us or by others and whethe
r mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such asadverse event reports, may also adve
rsely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with aproduct similar to one of our produ
cts that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability orcommercial potential of the affe
cted products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand forour products due to real or perceived 
side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in updated labeling, restrictions on use,product withdrawal or recall.
CHANGING REGULATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES
In 2014, the FDA issued a final guidan
ce document entitled “Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle.” Through this final guidance, the FDA has establishedadditional pre-market req
uirements for infusion pumps. At the same time, the FDA is also generally enhancing its pre-market requirements for medical devices.Although we cannot predict w
ith certainty the future impact of these initiatives, it appears likely that the process for obtaining regulatory approvals to marketinfusion pumps and me
dical devices will become more costly and time consuming.INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
Risks and uncertaintie
s apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional and/or government official. If the interaction is found to be improper,government enforcement actions and penalt
ies could result. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of newanti-bribery laws and regulatio
ns.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 26
CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDSOur future results could be adverse
ly affected by changes in laws and regulations, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, taxationrequirements (includ
ing tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations, including changes affecting the taxation by the U.S. ofincome earned outside
 the U.S. that may result from pending and possible future proposals), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S.and other countries.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental, employment andtax litigations and cla
ims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation isinherently unpredictable, and ex
cessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incurjudgments, enter into settlements of c
laims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operation
s in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Claims against our patents 
include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. Although we believe we havesubstantial defenses to these chal
lenges with respect to all of our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss inany of these cases could result 
in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and couldmaterially affect future
 results of operations.Like other pharmaceutical co
mpanies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed marketsand multiple emerging marke
ts in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges, andsubstantial fines and/
or civil penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from governmentinvestigations.
Our activities relat
ing to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug RebateProgram, the FCPA and other federal and state 
statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this 2015 Form 10-K, as well as anti-kickback and false claimslaws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions
. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and othertypes of information demands from gove
rnment authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought bygovernmental authorities, as 
well as by consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and otheradverse consequences
 as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. For example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures toaccurately interpret or ident
ify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved andunapproved), potentially resu
lting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including socialmedia, mobile applications an
d blogger outreach.ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings.Amounts recorded for contingencie
s can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates andassumptions. While we have accr
ued for worldwide environmental liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amountsaccrued. If we fail to properl
y manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accrualsfor contingencies for environ
mental claims and proceedings in the future, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
: PATENT PROTECTION
Our long-term success la
rgely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination ofintellectual property, 
including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and licenseagreements with our employees and othe
rs, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectualproperty protection, we may not be able to p
revent third parties from launching generic versions of our branded products, using our proprietary technologies orfrom marketing products that are ver
y similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or begranted on a timely basis. S
imilarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may notcontain claims sufficiently broad
 to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, includingexclusivity in a particular product
 area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinctive patent laws. WePfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 27
may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope andeffective term.
Our ability to enforce our patents a
lso depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual propertyrights, and the extent to which certa
in sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as aresult of local political pressure 
or in the case of national emergencies. In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permittingsome form of challenge to our patents by co
mpetitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity,and generic companies are inc
reasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits by genericdrug manufacturers involve c
laims that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, countercla
ims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, our patentrights with respect to certa
in products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In various jurisdictions, we are party to other patentdamages suits pursuant to which gene
ric drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of genericentry related to patent enforcement lit
igation. Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which thirdparties grant us rights to inte
llectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could bematerially adversely affected
. Likewise, in the U.S. and othe
r countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be thesubject of a governmental or third
-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same. As our products mature, our reliance on ourtrademarks to differentiate us from ou
r competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or usingtrademarks and trade dress that infr
inge, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected. We actively seekto protect our proprietary informat
ion, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and otherthird parties to execute proprieta
ry information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship.Despite these efforts and precautions, 
we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our otherintellectual property 
without authorization, and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by suchunauthorized use. 
Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property bymeans of alternative designs or p
rocesses or otherwise.THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning int
ellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights ofother companies, but the patent granting process 
is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectualproperty rights held by other compan
ies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not besuccessful. 
Part of our Established
 Products business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launchingproducts to take advantage of those opportunities, 
which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. Theseopportunities may arise 
in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or whereproducts do not infringe the patents of others. To ach
ieve a “first-to-market” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars, we maytake action, such as litigat
ion, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.Third parties may claim that
 our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consumingto resolve, may delay or prevent p
roduct launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputes with companies over ourattempts to market generic pharmaceut
ical products. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals, we may decide tocommercially ma
rket these products even though associated legal proceedings have not been resolved. If those proceedings ultimately determine that ourproducts infringe the patent rights of another 
company, we may face damages, including a requirement to pay a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from thesale of the branded product. Remedies a
lso may include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product for aperiod of time. Any of these adverse con
sequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.RISK RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY 
: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disrupt
ions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses. We rely to a large extentupon sophisticated information te
chnology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amountsof confidential information 
(including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical andprocedural controls to
Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 28
maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties,including signif
icant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with thirdparties who may or could have a
ccess to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems,and those of our third-party vendors w
ith whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systemspotentially vulnerable to 
service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks bymalicious third parties. Such a
ttacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives(including, but not limited 
to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. As a globalpharmaceutical company, our s
ystems are subject to frequent attacks. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remainundetected for a period of time. Whi
le we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts willprevent service interrupt
ions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result inthe loss of critical or sensitive c
onfidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Wemaintain cyber liability insurance; h
owever this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result froman interruption or br
each of our systems.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS 
: HOSPIRA ACQUISITION
We may fail to realize all of the anticipated bene
fits from our acquisition of Hospira.  The success of our acquisit
ion of Hospira will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses.Anticipated benefits and cost sav
ings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process may result in theloss of key employees, the di
sruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.We also may fail to generate the re
venue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction. In addition, Hospira hasexperienced manufacturing dis
ruptions, device remediations and increased regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues. Future manufacturing problems, as well asany corrective actions and the
ir operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from Hospira and result insubstantial unanticipate
d costs.PENDING COMBINATION WITH ALLERGAN
We and Allergan must obtain requi
red shareholder approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the merger, which, ifdelayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable condi
tions, may prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the merger, result in additionalexpenditures of money and resources and/or 
reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger.On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered 
into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan under which we have agreed to combine withAllergan. Completion of the p
roposed transaction with Allergan is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required approvalsof our shareholders and Allergan 
shareholders, clearance of the merger by certain governmental and regulatory authorities, including the expiration ortermination of applicable 
waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other filings or approvals as may be required pursuant tothe antitrust and
 competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, including the EU. The governmental agencies with which we and Allergan will make thesefilings and seek certain of the
se approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. We can provide no assurance that allrequired approvals and consents 
will be obtained. Moreover, as a condition to their approval of the transaction, certain governmental agencies may imposerequirements, limitat
ions or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of themerger. Any one of these requirements, 
limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the merger or reduce theanticipated benefits of the transaction. Fu
rther, no assurance can be given that the required shareholder approvals will be obtained or that the required closingconditions wil
l be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to theterms, conditions and tim
ing of the approvals or clearances. Finally, the closing of the merger is subject to the closing of Allergan’s pending divestiture of itsgenerics business to Tev
a Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., which itself is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of governmental and regulatoryconsents, and no assurance can be given that the c
losing of such divestiture will occur on a timely basis or at all. If we and Allergan agree to any requirements,limitations, costs, d
ivestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals or clearances required to consummate the transaction, these requirements,limitations, costs, d
ivestitures or restrictions could adversely affect the integration of the two companies’ operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of themerger. In addition, future potential change
s to the tax laws, if adopted prior to closing, could give rise to a right of Pfizer or Allergan to terminate the mergeragreement. The occurrence of any of the foregoing cou
ld result in a failure to consummate the merger or have a material adverse effect on the business andresults of operations of the combined 
company.If the merger is not completed for any rea
son, we may be subjected to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent thatcurrent market prices ref
lect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. InPfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 29
addition, some costs related to the merger must be paid whether or not the merger is completed. We may also experience negative reactions from ourshareholders, customers and emp
loyees. In addition, in specified circumstances, we could be required to reimburse expenses of Allergan or pay Allergan atermination fee of 
up to $3.5 billion.While the merger is pending, we and Allergan will be subjec
t to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses andoperations. These uncertainties could also adversely affect the co
mbined company following the completion of the merger.Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on emp
loyees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and Allergan. These uncertainties mayimpair our or Alle
rgan’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could causecustomers, suppliers and 
others who deal with us or Allergan to seek to change existing business relationships with us and/or Allergan. Employee retention maybe challenging during the pendency of the me
rger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart becauseof issues related to the uncertainty and d
ifficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the business of the combined company following themerger could be seriously h
armed.In addition, until the merger i
s completed, the merger agreement restricts us and Allergan from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party.These restrictions may, among othe
r things, prevent us or Allergan from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of themerger.
We may fail to realize all of the anticipated bene
fits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The combined companymay also encounter significant difficulties in integra
ting the two businesses.Our ability to reali
ze the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company’s ability to integrate the two businesses. Thecombination of two inde
pendent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant managementattention and resources to integrating our bu
siness practices and operations with Allergan’s business practices and operations. The integration process may bedisruptive to the businesses and, 
if implemented ineffectively, may restrict the full realization of expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved inintegrating the two businesses and to 
realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activitiesof the combined company and could adverse
ly affect the results of operations of the combined company.In addition, the overall integrat
ion of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customerand other business relationsh
ips and diversion of management attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:•
the diversion of management attention to integration matters;•
difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•
challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures betweenthe two companies;
•
difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel;•
challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;•
difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;•
difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company and in coordinating a geographically dispersedorganization; and
•
potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger.Many of these factors are outside of our contro
l and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in increased costs,decreased expected revenues and divers
ion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results ofoperations of the combined company. In addit
ion, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the merger may not berealized, including the ant
icipated synergies, cost savings and sales or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Further, additiona
l unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses, as well as prior to the consummation of thecombination. All of these facto
rs could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of themerger and negatively impact the p
rice of the combined company ordinary shares. As a result, it cannot be assured that the pending combination with Allerganwill result in the full realization of 
the benefits anticipated from the transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all.Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 30
In addition, although the combined company is expected, under current law, to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the IRSmay not agree with this treatment. E
ven if treated as a foreign corporation, certain adverse tax consequences may apply to the combined company that coulderode some of the synergies expected from the 
combination. Similarly, future changes in tax law could affect the combined company’s status as a foreigncorporation for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes or could otherwise materially and adversely affect some of the synergies expected from the combination. Anysuch changes in law or treatment b
y the IRS could have prospective or retroactive application, and may apply even if enacted or asserted after the merger isconsummated. Moreover, various 
U.S. federal and state legislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies (andsubsidiaries of U.S. 
companies) that move (or have moved) their corporate location abroad may affect Pfizer if adopted. Any such changes in law or treatmentby the IRS or other governmental agenc
ies could have a material adverse effect on the anticipated results of the operations of the combined company.Finally, our expectations 
regarding the timing and amount of accretion following consummation of the merger reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchasesby us. The actual timing and si
ze of any such share repurchases will depend on actual and expected financial results and the sufficiency of distributablereserves, as well as assessments
 at the time regarding capital allocation alternatives. Reduced or delayed share repurchase activity may result in less accretion.Our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the conside
ration they will receive in the merger, and may receive a form of consideration differentfrom what they elect. Our shareholde
rs will receive ordinary shares of the combined company as a result of the Allergan merger, which have rightsdifferent from shares of o
ur common stock and our preferred shares.Because the market price of Al
lergan ordinary shares and shares of our common stock will fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of theconsideration they wi
ll receive in the merger. In addition, because the exchange ratio is fixed, the number of ordinary shares of the combined company to bereceived by holders of Pfi
zer common stock in the merger will not change between now and the time the merger is completed to reflect changes in the tradingprices of Pfizer common 
stock or Allergan ordinary shares, share repurchases or other factors. Furthermore, although our shareholders will be entitled to elect toreceive Allergan ord
inary shares or cash consideration for their shares of our common stock, such elections will be subject to proration procedures set forth inthe merger agreement, such that our exist
ing shareholders will receive in the aggregate no less than $6 billion and no more than $12 billion in cash, andtherefore our existing shareholde
rs may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect.Upon completion of th
e Allergan merger, the rights of our existing shareholders who receive Allergan ordinary shares, which will become the ordinary shares ofthe combined company, wil
l be governed by the memorandum of association and articles of association of Allergan, which, subject to the amendmentscontemplated by the merger agreement, w
ill become the memorandum of association and articles of the combined company, and by Irish law. The rightsassociated with shares of our 
common stock and our preferred shares are different from the rights associated with these ordinary shares. In addition, the laws ofIreland differ from the laws 
in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of securities in the combined company.Finally, it is expe
cted that our existing shareholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 56% of the outstanding ordinaryshares of the combined company on a ful
ly diluted basis immediately following the effective time of the merger (based on the closing price of Pfizer commonstock and certain other assumption
s as of November 20, 2015). As a result, our shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the mergerand will exercise less influence over m
anagement.The market value of our common stock 
may be adversely affected as a result of financial statement charges and cash costs associated with ourproposed transaction with Allergan.
We expect to account for the proposed merger us
ing the acquisition method of accounting, which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affectour reported operating results. Unde
r this method, we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Allergan based ontheir fair values as of the date of the comp
letion of the proposed merger, and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Forcertain tangible and intangib
le assets, reevaluating fair value as of the completion date of the proposed merger will result in Pfizer incurring additionaldepreciation and/or amortizat
ion expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by Pfizer and Allergan prior to the proposed merger. This increasedexpense will be recorded b
y us over the useful lives of the underlying assets. In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to becomeimpaired, we may be requi
red to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets.We expect to incur a number of non-recu
rring costs associated with the integration process. The substantial majority of such expenses will be composed oftransaction costs, facilities a
nd systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs, although certain additional costs may be incurred as well, such aspotential costs related to l
itigation seeking to prevent the proposed transaction. We expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of otherefficiencies related to the
Pfizer Inc. 
| 2015 Form 10-K | 31
integration of the businesses will allow us to more than offset incremental transaction- and integration-related costs over time, but this net benefit may not beachieved in the near
 term, or at all.OTHER RISKS:
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
In addition to indus
try-specific factors, we, like other businesses, are exposed to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally.We believe that patien
ts, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switchto generic products, delay treatments, 
skip doses or use less effective treatments. We are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around theworld. The U.S. has highl
y competitive insurance markets. Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and a number of other international markets havegovernment-mandated reductions in pr
ices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the government-sponsoredhealthcare system, particu
larly under recent global economic pressures. Furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technologyassessments in ways that,
 at times, lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.The global economic enviro
nment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significantoperating cash flows, financ
ial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that wehave, and will mainta
in, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidityposition. However, there can be no a
ssurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidityor capital resources or 
impact our ability to obtain financing in the future. We continue to monitor the credit and economic situations in several internationalmarkets, including Venezue
la and Greece, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. We cannot predict the likelihood of future changes inthese economic conditions, or 
what impact they may have on our results of operations, financial condition or business.Other potential impacts of var
iations in the economic cycle include declining sales; increased costs; changes in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of,or a lower rate of return on, our financ
ial assets and pension plan investments, which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations; adversegovernment actions; delays or fa
ilures in the performance of customers, suppliers, and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of ourbusiness; and the risk that our al
lowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK
Significant portions of our 
revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. 56% of our total 2015 revenues were derived f
rom international operations, including 23% from Europe and 20% from Japan and the rest of Asia. As we operate inmultiple foreign curren
cies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound, the Canadian dollar and approximately 100 othercurrencies, changes in those cu
rrencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against anothercurrency, assuming all other
 variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses wouldincrease, having a negative i
mpact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variablesremained constant, our revenues wou
ld decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact onearnings. Therefore, signifi
cant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.The impact of possible c
urrency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results andfinancial guidance. For examp
le, in February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from an official rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of Venezuelan currencyto the U.S. dollar. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we 
resolved that our Venezuela bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are nolonger expected to be settled at the 6.3 rate, but at the SIMA
DI rate of 200, resulting in a foreign currency loss. News reports state the Venezuelan governmentannounced that, effective February 18, 2016, the officia
l rate of 6.3 would be replaced by a rate of 10.0; and, the operation of the SIMADI rate would change.See the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liq uidity and Capital Resources—Global Economic Conditions––Venezuela Operations section in our 2015 Financial Report for more information.
In addition, our interest-bearing 
investments and borrowings, and our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net, are subjectto risk from changes in inte
rest rates and foreign exchange rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in theForward-Looking Information and Facto
rs That May Affect Future Results — Financial Risk Management section in our 2015 Financia l Report. For additionaldetails, see the Notes to Conso
lidated Financial Statements— Note 7E. Financial Instrum ents: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities and — Note 11. Pension and Postretirement 
Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans in our 2015 Financial Report and the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estima
tes and Assumptions––Benefit Plans section in our 2015 Financia l Report. Those sections of our 2015 Financial Reportare incorporated by reference.

Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currencyand interest rates, inflation or othe
r related factors affecting our businesses.COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS/FAILURE TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF STRATEG
IC INITIATIVES ANDACQUISITIONS/INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD 
INVESTMENTSGrowth in costs and expenses, changes 
in product, segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internalreorganizations, product w
ithdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization andorganizational restructur
ing could adversely affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of(i) our cost-reduction an
d productivity initiatives; (ii) our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure; (iii) any othercorporate strategic initiatives
; (iv) any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, such as our recent acquisition of Hospira; and (v) our pending combinationwith Allergan.
In addition, our co
nsolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure issignificant, and there can be no certa
inty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-riskand requires that we invest in a 
large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. Our ability to realize value on thesesignificant investment
s is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of theseIPR&D assets wi
ll become impaired and be written off at some time in the future. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that canlead to a goodwill impa
irment charge (such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significantadverse change in legal matters o
r in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). Any such charge may besignificant. Our other intang
ible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assetsmay be significant as well. For
 additional details, see the Significant Accounting Policies and  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptionssection in our 2015 
Financial Report.We also regularly re
view our equity-method investments for impairment. An impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events ormanagement decisions that impact ou
r estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may recognize impairment charges as aresult of a weak economic env
ironment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management.INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The accuracy of our financial 
reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting canprovide only reasonable assu
rance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements.Failure to maintain eff
ective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine the ability to provideaccurate disclosure (including with r
espect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures(including with respect to fin
ancial information), require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency, and expose us to legal or regulatoryproceedings.
TERRORIST ACTIVITY
Our future results could be adverse
ly affected by changes in business, political and economic conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due tothe threat of terrorist activit
y in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.ITEM 1B.

 On June 27, 2013, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2015 (the June2013 Stock Purchase Plan). On October 23, 2014,
 we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized an additional $11 billion share-purchase plan, and sharepurchases commenced thereunder in January 2015 (the October 2014 Stock Purchase Plan). On February 9, 2015,
 we entered into an accelerated share repurchaseagreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) to repurchase shares of our common stock. This agreement was en
tered into under our previously announced sharerepurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11, 2015
, we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. On July 2, 2015, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with G
S&Co. was completed, which, per the terms of the agreement,resulted in us owing GS&Co. a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock or its equivalent dollar value. Pursuant to
 the agreement’s settlement terms, we elected tosettle this amount in cash and paid an additional 
$160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately $5.2 billion paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was $34.13 per share. In November 2015, Pfizer announced that, consistent
 with2015, it anticipates executing an approximately $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. The actual size and timing of any such share
repurchases will depend on actual and expected future results. 
In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. After giving effect to the accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in 2015, as
 well as other share repurchases through year-end 2015, ourremaining share-purchase authorization was approximately 
$16.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. (b) 
 These columns reflect the following transactions during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 : (i) the surrender to Pfizer of 65,760 shares of common stock to satisfy  taxwithholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees; (ii) the open market purchase by the trustee o
f 20,062 shares ofcommon stock in connection with the reinvestment of dividends paid on common stock held in trust for employees who were granted performance share awards and who
deferred receipt of such awards; (iii) the surrender to Pfizer of 185 shares of common stock to satisfy tax
 withholding obligations in connection with the vesting ofperformance share awards issued to employees; and (iv) the surrender to Pfizer of 222,272 shares of common stock to pay the

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls
As of the end of the period covered by this 
2015 Form 10-K, we carried out an eva luation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principalexecutive officer and princ
ipal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term isdefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15
(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officerconcluded that our disclosure 
controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in ourperiodic reports filed with th
e SEC.Internal Control over F
inancial ReportingManagement’s report on the Company’
s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the ExchangeAct), and the related report of our independent reg
istered public accounting firm, are included in our 2015 Financial Report under t he headings Management’s Report on Internal Co
ntrol Over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , respectively, and are inco
rporated by reference. Pfizer acquired Hospira on September 3, 2015, and management excluded from its assessment of theeffectiveness of Pfizer’s int
ernal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, Hospira’s and its subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reportingassociated with total asset
s of $24.2 billion and total revenues of $1.5 billion included in the consolidated financial statements of Pfizer Inc. and SubsidiaryCompanies as of and for the year ended Dece
mber 31, 2015.Changes in Internal Controls
During our most recent fis
cal quarter, management remediated an identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accountingfor the elimination of inter
company profit in inventory and certain other intercompany accounts. No restatement of prior period financial statements and nochange in previously re
leased financial results were required as a result of this finding. For the reporting period ended December 31, 2015, managementremediated the material weakne
ss by enhancing and adding additional reconciliation and review controls over the accounting for intercompany profit in inventoryand certain other intercompany account
s. The Company will continue to monitor these new controls and implement additional enhancements in 2016.Except for the foregoing, there was no change 
in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) in the most 
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internalcontrol over financial 
reporting. We continue to integrate Hospira’s operations into our internal control over financial reporting. None of these integration activitiesare expected to have a material impa
ct on our system of internal control over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.

(a) 
Under the Plan,  the Committee may grant Awards to Participants from time to time with respect to a Performance Period based upon the achievement ofperformance objectives over the 
Performance Period. Award payments are earned based upon the following:1)
The initial funding of the Incentive Pool is equal to the sum of the Target Incentive Awards for all Participants for the Performance Period.2)

e following financial measures (i) revenue, (ii) adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), and (iii) cash flow from operations.3)
Once the final pool funding is determined, Incentive Pool dollars are allocated to the business unit, division or function in which a Participantworked
 during the Performance Period based on the achievement of pre-set annual goals for the business unit, division or function, and asdetermined by the CEO.
4)
A Participant’s actual Award is determined based on his or her Target Incentive Award, adjusted by the funding factors stated above and furtheradjusted to reflect
 the specific business unit, division or country performance, as well as the Participant’s performance against objectives for thePerformance
 Period, as assessed by the Participant’s manager in accordance with procedures, guidelines and/or metrics established by theCommittee, or its designee
, from time to time.5) 
A Participant’s Target Inc entive Award is calculated as set forth below:(A) Where a Participant
’s Target Incentive Award is based on the Incentive Target Percentage, the Target Incentive Award is calculated as:i.
Group  1  Countries:  the  sum  of  the  product  of  a  Participant’s  month-end  Eligible  Earnings,  multiplied  by  the  Incentive  TargetPercentage
 for the Participant’s salary grade in the respective month, for each month the Participant is eligible to participate in thePlan.
ii.
Group 2 Countries: the product of a Participant’s Eligible Earnings as of the immediately preceding December 31 st , multiplied by theIncentive
 Target Percentage in effect on December 31 st for the Participant’s salary grade, pro-rated for the number of months duringthe calendar year in which
 he or she is eligible to participate in the Plan.iii.
For  Participants  in  the  ELTI  Program:  the  product  of  the  local  base  salary  midpoint  for  the  portion  of  each  month  during  thePerformance
 Period  in  which  he  or  she  is  eligible  to  participate  in  the  Plan  (adjusted  for  changes  in  grades,  Incentive  TargetPercentages
 or  eligibility,  as  applicable),  multiplied  by  the  Incentive  Target  Percentage  for  the  Participant’s  salary  grade  in  therespective month.
(B)
 Where a Participant’s Target Incentive Award is based on the Incentive Target Amount, the Target Incentive Award is calculated as 1/12 thof the annual fixed Target Incentive Amount for ea
ch month the Participant is eligible to participate in the Plan.(b) 
A Participant’s final Award shall be c apped at 200% of the Target Incentive Award which is the maximum Incentive Award Opportunity.(c) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any  Award may also be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem advisable or appropriatefrom
 time to time, consistent with the provisions of the Plan as herein set forth, including but not limited to, the pro-ration or adjustment of Target IncentiveAwards,
 Incentive Target Percentages and/or Incentive Award Opportunities, and Incentive Target Amounts, based upon a Participant’s date of hire, re-hire,change
 in position and/or salary grade (including a change in position or other similar change that causes the Participant to no longer be eligible for the Plan),change
 in  local  base  salary  midpoint,  or  transfer  to  a  different  business  unit  or  division  during  a  Performance  Period.  In  addition,  any  Awards  granted  toParticipants may contain
 such other provisions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the Code and/or related regulations issued thereunder in orderto satisfy or comply with releva
nt law.4

SECTION 6. PAYMENT OF AWARDSUnless

The
 Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to amend or terminate the Plan, at any time, including after the end of the calendar year andprior to

 to,  eligibility  for  an  Award,  determination  of  Incentive  Pool  funding,  the  modification  of  incentive  measures,  performance  targets  and/or  performanceresults.
 This right also includes the modification of the terms of the Plan, as may be necessary or desirable, to comply with applicable laws and local customs ofcountries
 in which the Company operates or has employees. The Company’s obligation to pay compensation as herein provided is subject to any applicableorders, rules or regulation
s of any government agency or office having authority to regulate the payment of wages, salaries and other forms of compensation.The
 Committee may delegate to another committee or person, as it may appoint, the authority to take any action consistent with the terms of the Plan, eitherbefore
 or  after  an  Award  has  been  granted,  which  such  other  committee  or  person  deems  necessary  or  advisable  to  comply  with  any  government  laws  orregulatory
 requirements of a foreign country, including but not limited to, modifying or amending the terms and conditions governing any Awards, or establishingany
 local  country  plans  as  sub-plans  to  this  Plan.  In  addition,  under  all  circumstances,  the  Committee  or  its  delegate  which  for  this  purpose  includes  theExecutive
 Vice President, Worldwide Human Resources and the Senior Vice President, Total Rewards, may make non-substantive administrative changes tothe Plan as to conform with or take ad
vantage of governmental requirements, statutes or regulations.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, the Committee or its designee may amend the terms of any Award heretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, in order tocure
 any potential defects under Section 409A, in a manner deemed appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion and absolute discretion, without theconsent of the Participant.
SECTION 9. DEFERRAL OF AWARDS UNDER THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Except
 as otherwise provided in this Plan, the Committee may provide upon the granting of an Award hereunder, that it is eligible to be deferred under, andpursuant
 to the terms and conditions of, the Pfizer Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time. Any such deferral shallbe in accordance with the terms of 
such plan and in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A.SECTION 10. TAX CONSIDERATIONS
(a) 
For Participants in the Unit ed States , Award payments under the Plan will be treated as taxable income for the year in which the Participant receives thepayment. The Company and its Affi
liates shall be authorized to withhold appropriate amounts from such6

payments to satisfy all federal, state and local tax withholding requirements and any other authorized deductions due in respect of an Award payment hereunderand to take such other action as may be deemed neces
sary in the opinion of the Company or Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.Notwithstanding
 anything herein to the contrary, the terms of the Plan are intended to, and shall be interpreted and applied so as to, comply in all respects withSection 409A.
 The Committee may amend the terms of any Award heretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, in order to cure any potential defects underSection
 409A, in a manner deemed appropriate by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, without the consent of the Participant. Nothing in thisSection 10 shall be construed as an ad
mission that any of the compensation and/or benefits payable under this Plan constitutes “deferred compensation” subjectto
 Section 409A. Furthermore, the Company does not represent, covenant or guarantee that any particular Award made under the Plan will be exempt fromSection 409A and/or wil
l avoid unfavorable tax consequences to the Participant (e.g., Section 409A penalties).(b) 
For Participants located outs ide of the United States, local country rules on taxation and withholding treatment will apply.(c) 
Awards made to  Participants eligible under the EAIP are intended to qualify as “performance based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code sothat
 they are deductible for United States tax purposes by the Company. Awards made to Participants eligible for the EAIP will be governed by the additionalterms
 and conditions included in that plan. With respect to all Awards to Participants eligible under the EAIP, to the extent that there are any conflicts betweenthis Plan and the t
erms of the EAIP, the EAIP will prevail.SECTION 11. RECOUPMENT
In
 the event of a significant restatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements (other than a restatement resulting from a change in accountingprinciples),
 the  Committee  will  review  Awards  made  under  the  Plan  for  performance  for  the  fiscal  periods  affected  by  the  restatement.  If  the  Committeedetermines
 that an Award would have been lower (or would not have been made) if it had been based on the restated results, the Committee may, to the extent permitted by
 applicable law, seek recoupment of all or any portion of such Award as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion, after a review of allrelevant
 facts  and  circumstances.  Any  recoupment  may  be  in  addition  to  any  other  remedies  that  may  be  available  to  the  Company  under  applicable  law.Nothing
 contained in this paragraph will limit the Company’s ability to seek recoupment, in appropriate circumstances and as permitted or required by applicablelaw
 (including Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), of any amounts from any Employee, whether or not the Employee is a seniorexecutive.
 If a Participant owes any outstanding debt, including but not limited to loans, vacation and salary and expense advances, to the Company or anyAffiliates,
 any Award payable to the Participant under this Plan, to the extent such amount is exempt from Section 409A, shall be reduced by the full amount ofsuch debt, as permitted by law.
SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a) 
Awards under this Plan are considered variable compensation and as such are not guaranteed.(b) 
No  Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a futureAward. Neither the Award nor any benefits arising out of this Plan shall constitute part of
 a Participant’s employment or service contract with the Company or anyAffiliate and,
 accordingly, this Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Company without givingrise to liabil
ity on the part of the Company or any Affiliate for severance payments.(c)

ipant any right to continue in the employ or service of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Affiliate or limit inany way the right of the Company or any 
Affiliate to terminate an Employee’s employment or Participant’s service at any time, with or without Cause.(e)
 Except  as  otherwise  required  by  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  recipients  of  Awards  under  the  Plan  shall  not  be  required  to  make  any  payment  or  provideconsideration other than the rendering of se
rvices.(f)
 If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award underany
 law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construedor
 deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Planshall remain in full force and
 effect.(g)
 Awards may be granted and paid to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditionsdifferent
 from those applicable to Awards to Participants employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable inorder
 to  recognize  differences  in  local  law  or  tax  policy.  The  Committee  also  may  impose  conditions  on  the  payment  of  Awards  in  order  to  minimize  theCompany’s obligation 
with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home country.(h)
 If approved by the Committee in its sole discretion, an Employee’s absence or leave because of military or governmental service, disability or other reasonshall not be considered an inter
ruption of employment for any purpose under the Plan; provided, however,7

that to the extent an Award under this Plan is subject to Section 409A, such absence or leave shall be considered a Separation from Service to the extentprovided by Section 409A.

    OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Our Business
We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of
healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines, vaccines and medical devices, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We
work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We
 collaborate withhealthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the
sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (Alliance revenues).
The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated.
As a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges which can significantly impact our results. These factors include, among others: 
the loss or expirationof intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access
pressures and competition. We also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. For additional information about these factors and challenges, see 
the“Our Operating Environment” section of this Financial Review and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial information included in our consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States (U.S.) is as of and for the year ended
November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented.
References to developed markets in this Financial Review include the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, Sou
th Korea, Finland and New Zealand;and references to emerging markets in this Financial Review include, but are not limited to, the following markets: Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), Latin America,
Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, the Middle East and Turkey.
References to operational variances in this Financial Review refer to variances excluding the impacts of foreign exchange.
On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan plc (Allergan), a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in
Ireland, under which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total en
terprise value of approximately $160billion, based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to 
the announcement) and certain other assumptions.Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the businesses of
 Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under a single company and Pfizer would become awholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan, which is organized under the laws of Ireland and which, subject to the approval by Allergan shareholders, will be renamed “Pfizer plc”. We
anticipate that the parent company will be treated as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a
 non-U.S. tax resident) under the applicable U.S. federal income tax rules,although the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may challenge that treatment. The completion of
 the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2016, is subject tocertain conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and European Union (EU), the receipt of necessary approvals from both
Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and the completion of Allergan’s pending divestiture of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Readers are
encouraged to review the joint proxy statement/prospectus we will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking stockholder approval of the
transaction. That document will include important information regarding the proposed transaction. While we have taken actions and incurred costs associated with the pending
combination that are reflected in our financial statements, the pending combination with Allergan will not be reflected in our financial statements until consummation. See the
“Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 19 . Pending Combination with Allergan for additional information.
On September 3, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira, Inc. (Hospira) for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira, and,
 in accordance with our domestic andinternational reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2015 reflect four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Acquisitions and the “Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates––Acquisition of Hospira” section of this Financial Review for additional information. Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer and its commercial operations
are now included within the Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) segment. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions

tion with theHospira acquisition. Based on our past experience, the one-time costs to generate the synergies are expected to
 be approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 millionin 2015 associated with the return of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) rights), incurred for up to a three-year period post-acquisition. See the

Industry-Specific Challenges
Intellectual Property Rights 
and Collaboration/Licensing RightsThe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Many of our
branded products have multiple patents that expire at varying dates, thereby strengthening our overall patent protection.
 However, once patent protection has expired or hasbeen lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we

    lose exclusivity on these products, and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic
competition commences may be different from the date that the patent
 or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic competition does commence, the resultingprice competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time.
Our biotechnology products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the
 U.S. and Canada), may face competition in the future frombiosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products, our
biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. Expiration or
successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. However, biosimilar manufacturing is
complex. At least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor, biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect
to small molecule drugs.
We have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain
markets, and we expect certain products and alliance products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.

 included in Revenues , our royalties afte r October 31, 2013 are and will be included in Other (income)/deduction s––net , in our consolidated stateme nts of income. Outside the U.S. andCanada, we continue to have 
the exclusive rights to market Enbrel.(c) 
 Our collaboration agreement with EMD Serono Inc. to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. expired at the end of 2015.In addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. For additional information, see 
the “Patents and OtherIntellectual Property Rights” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our financial results in 
2015 and our 2016 financial guidance, respectively, reflect the impact and projected impact of the loss of exclusivity of various products and the expiration of certain alliance product contract rights discussed above. For additional information about our

Note 17A1. Commitments and Contingencies: Legal Proceedings –– Patent Litigation . Regulatory Environment/Pricing a
nd Access––U.S. Healthcare LegislationIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Af
fordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the U.S. Healthcare Legislation,and also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA), was enacted in the
 U.S. For additional information, see the “Government Regulation and Price Constraints” section in PartI, Item 1, “Business”, of our 
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The U.S. Healthcare Legislation also created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow- on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. For additional information on the
biosimilar approval pathway, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) guidance documents and competition from biosimilar manufacturers, see the “Patents and
Intellectual Property—Biotechnology Products” and “Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Biosimilar Regulation” sections in Part I, Item 1 “Business”, of our 
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impacts on our 
2015 Results We recorded the following amounts in 
2015 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation: •
$977 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues , related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision, as well as an increase in Medicaid rebates; and
•
$251 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for U. S. incometax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. The decrease in
the impact of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation on 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the non-recurrence of the $215 million charge in 2014 to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded 
Prescription Drug Fee, partially offset by a lower favorable true-up in2015, compared to the favorable true-up in 2014, associated with the final invoice for the respective prior-calendar year received from the federal government, which
reflected a lower share than that of the initial invoice.

    Impacts on our 
2014 Results We recorded the following amounts in 
2014 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation: •
$631 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues , related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and
•
$362 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government. 2014  included a $215 million charge toaccount for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by 
the IRS.The amount in 2014 also reflected a favorable true-up associated with the final 2013 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower share than that
of the initial 2013 invoice.
The final regulations issued by the IRS did not change the payment schedule for the
 Branded Prescription Drug Fee; accordingly there was no cash flow impact in 2014 fromthe $215 million charge.
Impacts on our 2013 Results
We recorded the following amounts in 
2013 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation: •
$458 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and
•
$280 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government. Regulatory Environment/P
ricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group PressuresGovernments, managed care organizations and other payer groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our products through a variety of means, such
 as leveraging theirpurchasing power, implementing price controls, and demanding price cuts (directly or by rebate actions). In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other
international markets, governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored healthcare system. In the U.S., a primary government activity with implications for pharmaceutical pricing is deficit reduction. Any significant spending
reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that
may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results o
f operations.Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing
restrictions. A number of the candidates for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections have introduced such policy proposals, and a
 November 2015 U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services forum dedicated to drug pricing could lead to further proposals. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on
the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We continue to work with stakeholders in an effort 
to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordablehealthcare system. In addition, certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect Pfizer's obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, but 
the impact ofthose changes is not yet known.
The ACA, which expanded the role of the U.S. government as a
 healthcare payer, is accelerating changes in the U.S. healthcare marketplace, and the potential for additionalpricing and access pressures continues to be significant. Many of these developments may impact drug utilization, in particular branded drug utilization. Some employers,
seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the ACA originally to be imposed in 2018 (now to be imposed in 2020, per 
the terms of the fiscal year 2016 omnibusappropriations legislation), are already scaling back healthcare benefits. Some health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are seeking greater pricing predictability from
pharmaceutical manufacturers in contractual negotiations. Other health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are increasing their focus on spending on specialty medicines by
implementing co-insurance in place of a flat co-payment. Because co-insurance passes on a percentage of a drug’s cost to the pa
tient, this shift has the potential tosignificantly increase patient out-of-pocket costs.
Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health
outcomes. Longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward
providers for cost reductions. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to,
 new medicines. At the same time, these models canalso expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes.
In response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health 
technology assessment and qualitymeasurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products
. Further,we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by
recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.
Regulatory Environment––Pipeline
 ProductivityThe discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development o
f additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength ofour businesses. We have encountered increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, even as we continue 
to gather safety and other data on our products, beforeand after the products have been launched. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offse
t revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, aswell as to provide for earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. These activities involve a high degree of risk and cost and may take many years,
and
6
 
 2015 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    with respect to any specific R&D project, there can be no assurance that the
 development of any particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product willachieve desired clinical endpoints and safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We continue to strengthen our global R&D organization
and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time.
During the development of a product, we conduct clinical trials to provide data on the drug’s safety and ef
ficacy to support the evaluation of its overall benefit-risk profile for aparticular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved and launched, we continue 
to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, and post-marketing trials may be conducted, including trials requested by regulators and trials that we do voluntarily to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the
product, we collect safety data and report potential problems to the FDA and o
ther regulatory authorities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may evaluatepotential safety concerns related to a product or a class of products and 
take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product’s labeling, restricting the use of aproduct, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, removing a product from the market.
Competition
Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. For additional information,
see the “Competition” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 2015 
Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Global Economic Environment
In addition to industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, are exposed to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations
globally.
•
We believe that patients, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switch to genericproducts, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. We
 are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around the world. The U.S. hashighly competitive insurance markets, and Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and a number of other international markets have government-mandated
reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under
recent global economic pressures. Furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to
restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.
•
We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets, including Greece, where economicconditions remain challenging and uncertain. For further information about our 
Accounts Receivable , see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.
•
Significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek tomanage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency
assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments
and foreign currency debt. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound
, the Canadian dollarand approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken
against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses
would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained
constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. Therefore,
significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.
The impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including Venezuela, can impact our results
and financial guidance. In 2015, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $806 million and an inventory impairment charge of $72 million related to recent conditions in
Venezuela. For further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the “Our
Financial Guidance for 2016” sections of this Financial Review. For further information about our foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, see Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements–– 
Note 4 . Other (Income)/Deductions –– Net.Despite the challenging financial markets, Pfizer maintains a strong financial position. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets
and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable
future. Our long-term debt is rated high quality by both Standard & Poor’s (S&
P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). As market conditions change, we continue tomonitor our liquidity position. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist
primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, availab
le-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion about our financial condition, see the “Analysis of FinancialCondition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.

    Our Strategy
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also 
from a reductionin other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in
dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to
 prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We continue towork within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to
patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that
extend and significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients
 we serve and for our shareholders.Commercial Operations
We manage our commercial operations through two distinct businesses: an Innovative Products business and an Established Products business. The 
Innovative Productsbusiness is composed of two operating segments, each of which has been led by a single manager in 2015 and 2014––the 
Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment (GIP) and the 
Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment (VOC). Effective February 8, 2016, the Innovative Products  business is led by a single manager. TheEstablished Products business consists of the 
Global Established Pharmaceutical segment (GEP), which is also led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have
achieved proof of concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.
Some additional information about each business and operating segment follows:
Innovative Products Business
  Established Products Business Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment:
GIP focuses on developing and commercializing
novel, value-creating medicines that significantly
improve patients’ lives. Key therapeutic areas
include inflammation/immunology,
cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience/pain and
rare diseases and include leading brands, such as
Xeljanz, Eliquis, Lyrica (U.S. and Japan), Enbrel
(outside the U.S. and Canada) and Viagra (U.S.
and Canada).
  Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcaresegment:
VOC focuses on the development and commercialization of
vaccines and products for oncology and consumer
healthcare. Consumer Healthcare manufactures and markets
several well known, over-the-counter (OTC) products. Each
of the three businesses in VOC operates as a separate,
global business, with distinct specialization in terms of the
science and market approach necessary to deliver value to
consumers and patients.
  Global Established Pharmaceutical segment:GEP includes legacy brands that have lost or will
soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and
emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile
injectable products, biosimilars and infusion systems.
 
We expect that the GIP and 
VOC biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoinginvestments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of
unmet medical need. The assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers
and consumers.
GEP is expected to generate strong consistent cash 
flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. GEP leverages ourbiologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, GEP leverages capabilities in formulation
development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. In addition, GEP may also engage in targeted business development 
tofurther enable its commercial strategies. GEP has the knowledge and resources within R&D to develop small molecules, including injectables, and biosimilars. On September
3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, and its commercial operations are now included within GEP. Commencing from the acquisition date, and in accordance with our domestic and
international reporting periods, our consolidated statement of income, primarily GEP’s operating results, for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four months of legacy
Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. For additional information about the Hospira acquisition, see Notes to Consolidated

Following the closing of the pending combination with Allergan, the Vaccines and Oncology businesses are expected to be combined with the Global Innova
tivePharmaceutical business and we expect to create a new global business, Global Specialty and Consumer Brands, that includes our Consumer Healthcare business and
Allergan’s ophthalmology and aesthetics businesses, as well as Botox Therapeutic and Cosmetic. Allergan’s Anda distribution capabilities and brands in women’s health and
anti-infectives are expected to be combined with the Global Established Pharmaceutical business.

promise, innovating new capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of
innovation and productivity. To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules––immunology and
inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. Another area of focus is biosimilars. With the acquisition
of Hospira, we have expanded our biosimilars pipeline and added R&D capabilities for sterile injectables and infusion systems.
While a significant portion of R&D is done internally through the Worldwide Research and Development (WRD) organization, we continue to seek to enhance our pipeline of
potential future products by entering into collaborations, alliance and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based
investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. Collaboration, alliance and license agreements
and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost, to access external scientific and technological expertise, and enable us 
to advance our own products aswell as in-licensed or acquired products.

Business Development
We continue to build on our broad portfolio of businesses and to expand our R&D pipeline through various business development transactions. For additional information about
recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe have the potential to advance
 our pipeline, enhance our product portfolio and maximize the value of our in-lineproducts, see the “Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review.
Intellectual Property Rights
We continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen
worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. In addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches
designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and
 we will continue toparticipate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. For additional information about our current efforts to enforce our
intellectual property rights, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Capital Allocation and Expense
 ManagementWe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity so that we continue to
 have the financial resources necessary to take advantage of prudent commercial,research and business development opportunities and to directly enhance shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. For additional information about our
financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, share repurchases and dividends, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this
Financial Review.
On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland, under
which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion, based on
the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to 
the announcement) and certain other assumptions. See the “OurBusiness”, “Our Business Development Initiatives” and “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Financial Review for additional
information.
On September 3, 2015, (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (G
S&Co.) to repurchase shares of our common stock. Thisagreement was entered into under our previously announced share repurchase authorization. In July 2015, we completed the agreement. For additional information, see the
“Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 12. Equity. In November 2015, we announced that, consistent with 2015, we expect to execu
te an approximately $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Weanticipate additional future share repurchases to continue following the consummation of the pending combination with Allergan. The actual size and timing of any such share
repurchases will depend on actual and expected financial results.
In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. Also, on December 14, 
2015 , our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 
2016 dividend of $0.30 per share, an increase from the $0.28 per-share 2015 Financial Report

Note 3 . Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.Our Business Development Initiatives
We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of
business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view
our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic
and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. We are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas—immunology and
inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases––and in emerging markets and established products,
including biosimilars. We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen one or both
 of our businesses and their capabilities,such as our recent acquisition of Hospira and our pending combination with Allergan, as well as collaborations, and alliance and license agreements with other companies,
including our collaborations with Cellectis SA, OPKO Health, Inc. and Merck KGaA. We assess
 our businesses, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular,ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our businesses. We are continuing to consider whether a
further separation of our Innovative Products and Established Products businesses would be in the bes
t interests of our shareholders. However, no decision has been maderegarding any such potential separation; we anticipate making a decision regarding any such potential separation by no later than the end of 2018.

The more significant recent transactions and events are described below:
•
Agreement to Combine with Allergan plc (Allergan) ––On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland.
•
Acquisition of Hospira ––On September 3, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). •
Acquisition of a Minority Interest in AM-Pharma B.V. (AM-Pharma) ––In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recombinant human Alkaline Phosphatase (recAP) for inflammatory diseases, and secured an exclusive option
to acquire the remaining equity in the company. The option becomes exercisable upon delivery of the clinical trial report after completion of a Phase II trial of recA
P in thetreatment of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis. Results from the current 
Phase II trial for recAP are expected in 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid $87.5million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in 
Long-term investments , and we may make additional payments of up to $512.5 million upon exercise of the option and potential launch of any product
 that may result from this investment.•
Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO) ––In December 2014, we entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long- acting human growth hormone (hGH-CTP) for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in
children born small for gestational age (SGA) who fail to show catch-up growth by two years of age. hGH-CTP has the po
tential to reduce the required dosing frequency ofhuman growth hormone to a single weekly injection from the current standard of one injection per day. We have received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP
worldwide. OPKO will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which include Adult and Pediatric
GHD and Pediatric SGA. We will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications, all postmarketing studies, manufacturing and commercialization
activities for all indications, and we will lead the manufacturing activities related to product development. The transaction closed on January 28, 2015, upon termination of
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. In February 2015, we made an upfront
 payment of $295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of
hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and our product,
Genotropin.
•
Acquisition of Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) ––On December 1, 2014 (which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchase price of $648 million. The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and
FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a
vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis.
•
Collaboration with Merck KGaA ––In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative agreement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently in development as a potential treatment for multiple
types of cancer. We and Merck KGaA are exploring the therapeutic potential of
 this novel anti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with ourand Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of approved and investigational oncology therapies. The collaboration with Merck KGaA has initiated 28 programs, monotherapy and
combination trials, including seven pivotal trials in Phase IB/2 or Phase 3 (two in lung cancer, two in gastric cancer, and one in each of
 bladder cancer, Merkel cellcarcinoma and ovarian cancer) and received FDA breakthrough therapy designation for avelumab in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. We and Merck KGaA are also
combining resources and expertise to advance Pfizer’s anti-PD-1 antibody into

    Phase 1 trials. Under the terms of the agreement, in the fourth quarter o
f 2014, we made an upfront payment of $850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . Both companies will jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 products from this collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we gave Merck KGaA
certain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S. and several other key markets, and co-promotion activities were initiated in key select markets in 2015. In 2014, we
recorded $1.2 billion of 
Research and development expenses associated with this collaborative arrangement, composed of the $850 million upfront cash payment as well as an additional amount of $309 million, reflecting the estimated fair value of the co-promotion rights given to Merck KGaA.
•
Acquisition of InnoPharma, Inc. (InnoPharma) ––On September 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of InnoPharma, a privately-held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment of $225 million and contingent consideration of up to $135
 million.•
License from Cellectis SA (Cellectis) ––In June 2014, we entered into a global arrangement with Cellectis to develop Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select cellular surface antigen targets. In August
 2014, in connection with this licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment of $80million to Cellectis, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses . We will also fund research and development costs associated with 15 Pfizer-selected targets and, for the benefit of Cellectis, a portion of 
the R&D costs associated with four Cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. Cellectis is eligible to receivedevelopment, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per product that results from the Pfizer-selected targets. Cellectis is also eligible to
receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by Pfizer.
•
Investment in ViiV Healthcare Limited (ViiV) ––On January 21, 2014, the European Commission approved Tivicay (dolutegravir), a product for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, developed by ViiV, an equity-method investee. This approval, in accordance with the agreement between GlaxoSmithKline plc and P
fizer, triggered a reduction inour equity interest in ViiV from 12.6% to 11.7% and an increase in GlaxoSmithKline plc’s equity interest in ViiV from 77.4%
 to 78.3%, effective April 1, 2014. As a result, in2014, we recognized a loss of approximately 
$30 million in Other (income)/deductions –– net . We account for our investment in ViiV under the equity method due to thesignificant influence that we continue to have through our board representation and minority veto rights.
•
Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company (Lilly) ––In October 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer ’ stanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following
the decision by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly in
accordance with the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized
into 
Other (income)/deductions –– net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program fortanezumab in July 2015, which will consist of six studies in approximately 7,000 patients across osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. Under the
collaboration agreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.
•
Divestiture of Zoetis ––On June 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of Zoetis. The full disposition was completed through a series of steps, including, in the firstquarter of 2013, the formation of Zoetis and an initial public offering (IPO) of an
 approximate 19.8% interest in Zoetis and, in the second quarter of 2013, an exchange offerfor the remaining 80.2% interest.
•
Collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) ––In April 2013, we announced that we entered into a worldwide (except Japan) collaboration agreement with Merck for the development and commercialization of Pfizer’s ertugliflozin (PF-04971729), an investigational oral sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitor currently in Phase 3
development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
•
Investment in Hisun Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Company Limited (Hisun Pfizer) ––On September 6, 2012, we and Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Hisun), a leading pharmaceutical company in China, formed a new company, Hisun Pfizer, to develop, manufacture, market and sell pharmaceutical products, primarily branded generic
products, predominately in China. In the first quarter of 2013, we and Hisun contributed certain assets to
 Hisun Pfizer. Hisun Pfizer is 49% owned by Pfizer and 51% ownedby Hisun. Our contributions constituted a business, as defined by U.S. 
GAAP, and in 2013, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $459 million in Other (income)/deductions––net 
. In the third quarter of 2015, we determined that we had an  other-than-temporary decline in value of our equity-method investment in HisunPfizer, and, therefore, in 2015, we recognized a loss of 
$463 million in Other (income)/deductions––net. The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun Pfizer, as a result of lower than expec
ted recent performance, increased competition, a slowdown in the China economy inrelation to their products, as well as changes in the regulatory environment.
•
License of Nexium OTC Rights ––In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca PLC (As traZeneca) for the exclusive, global, over-the-counter (OTC)rights for Nexium, a leading prescription drug approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In connection with this Consumer Healthcare licensing
agreement, we made an upfront payment of $250 million to AstraZeneca, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses when incurred. On May 27, 2014, we launched Nexium 24HR in the U.S., and on July 11, 2014, we paid AstraZeneca a related $200 million product launch milestone payment. On 
August 1, 2014, welaunched Nexium Control in Europe, and on September 15, 2014, we paid AstraZeneca a related $50 million product launch milestone payment. These post-approval
milestone payments were recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the Nexium brand. Included in 
Other current liabilities at December 31, 2015 are accrued milestone payments to AstraZeneca of $93 million. AstraZeneca is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to $200 million, based on the level of worldwide sales as well as quarterly royalty payments based on worldwide sales.

. For a discussion about the application of Fair Value to our asset impairment reviews, see “Asset Impairment Reviews” below.
Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period tha
t the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent rebates, chargebacks and sales allowances to government agencies, wholesalers/distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical
products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for 
the reporting period, and, as such, knowledge and judgment of marketconditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments,
 experiences orjudgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Becauseof this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
Asset Impairment Reviews
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements–– 
Note 1K. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets.Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rightswould likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affectour ability to manufacture or sell a product.
•
A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursementprogram that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in
a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of
 a product by patients, physiciansand payers. For in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay
in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended December
31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions — Net.When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We s
tartwith a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the
 asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply anasset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of 
the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount andtiming of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on 
the projections and the impact of technological riskassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount
 rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cashflows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash
 flows.While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at
risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately 
$1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 ) and newly 2015 Financial Report    
 
 13
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets (approximately 
$145 million as of December 31, 2015 ). IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as research and development is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair
value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As
 such, immediately after acquisition or impairment,even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.
Goodwill
As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of 
December 31, 2015 , and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Our Consumer Healthcare reporting unit has the
narrowest difference between estimated fair value and estimated book value. A hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our Consumer Healthcare reporting unit of
approximately 10% could trigger a potential impairment of its goodwill. Examples of events or circumstances that could impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit may
include items such as changes in operating results, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate, market multiples, among others.
 Our Consumer Healthcare reporting unitperformance and consumer healthcare industry market multiples are highly correlated with the overall economy and our specific performance is also dependent on our and our
competitors’ innovation and marketing effectiveness, and on regulatory developments affecting claims, formulations and ingredients of our products. While historical
performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the fu
ture an impairmentcharge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge in the fu
ture would be material.When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use
the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.
•
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we useis the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of
 all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of aterminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of
 the more significant estimates and assumptionsinherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected
 impact of technological risk and competitive, legaland/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate,
 which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in theprojected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.•
The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we mayuse:
◦
Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similarlines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the
 application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reportingunit’s financial performance.
◦
Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar linesof business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.
The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued;
however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: 
theselection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership
percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
Specifically:
•
When we estimate the fair value of our four biopharmaceutical reporting units, we rely solely on the income approach. We use the income approach exclusively as the useof the comparable guideline company method is not practical or reliable. For the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method.
•
When we estimate the fair value of our Consumer Healthcare reporting unit, we use a combination of approaches and methods. We use the income approach and themarket approach, which we weight equally in our analysis. We weight them equally as we have equal confidence in the appropriateness of the approaches for this reporting
unit. For the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method and for the
 market approach, we use both the guideline public company method and the guidelinetransaction method, which we weight equally to arrive at our market approach value.
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome ofsubsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affec
t Future Results” section of this FinancialReview and Part I. Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both Internal Revenue Codequalified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical
insurance for retirees.

    The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about fu
tureevents and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the employee benefit obligations for the defined bene
fit and postretirement plansinclude the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); expected return on
assets; and healthcare cost trend rates.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we approved a change, e
ffective January 1, 2016, to the U.S. postretirement medical plan to transfer certain plan participants to a retiree drugcoverage program eligible for a Medicare Part D plan subsidy (Employer Group Waiver Plan). This change resulted in a decrease to the postretirement benefit obligation of
approximately $600 million as of December 31, 2014.
As of December 31, 2015, the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net
, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net decreased, in the aggregate, byapproximately 
$2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease reflects, among other things, an increase in our discount rate assumptions used in the  measurementof the plan obligations, a $1 billion voluntary contribution made in January, 2015, a plan amendment approved in June 2015 that introduced a cap
 on costs for certain groupswithin the U.S. postretirement medical plan, and a rise in the comparative strength of the U.S.
 dollar, as compared to other currencies.Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.
The following table provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on
 plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on planassets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end o

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-lookingreturn expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in ourrespective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end andthe resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. In January 2016, P
fizer made a voluntary contribution of $1.0 billion to plan assets. In2016, this contribution will be included in the plan asset balance for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the
 expected annual rate of return on plan assets,holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

$163 million during 2015. Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, asrequired, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or be
tter, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefitscould be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least
 annually by reference to investment gradecorporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there are sufficient da
ta, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of localrequirements.
The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect 
the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefitcosts in the following year.

. Acquisition of Hospira
Description of Transaction
On September 3, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars,
for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Recording of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
Our acquisition of Hospira has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which generally requires that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments abou
t future events and uncertainties and reliesheavily on estimates and assumptions. Our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well asasset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. For instance, the determination of asset lives can impact our results of operations as dif
ferent types of assets willhave different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
For the provisional amounts recognized for the Hospira assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––
Note 2A. 
Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment : Acquisitions . The estimated values are not yet finalized and are subject to change, which could be significant. We will finalize the amounts recognized as we obtain the
 information necessary tocomplete the analyses. We expect to finalize the amounts of assets
 acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.The following amounts are subject to change:
•
Amounts for certain balances included in working capital (excluding inventories), certain investments and certain legal contingencies, pending receipt of certain informationthat could affect provisional amounts recorded. We do not believe any adjustments for legal contingencies will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
•
Amounts for intangibles, inventory and property, plant and equipment, pending finalization of valuation efforts for acquired intangible assets as well as the completion ofcertain physical inventory counts and the confirmation of the physical existence and condition of certain property, plant and equipment asse
ts.•
Amounts for income tax assets, receivables and liabilities, pending the filing of Hospira pre-acquisition tax returns and the receipt of information including but not limited tothat from taxing authorities, which may change certain estimates and assumptions used.
Below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain classes of assets and liabilities of Hospira.
For financial instruments acquired from Hospira, our valuation approach was consistent with our valuation methodologies used for our legacy Pfizer financial instruments. For
additional information on the valuation of our financial instruments, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7. Financial Instruments . Inventories 
—The fair value of acquired inventory ($1.9 billion) was determined as follows: •
Finished goods— Estimated selling price, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to sell the inventory, and an es timate of a reasonable profit allowance for that sellingeffort.
•
Work in process— Estimated selling price of an equivalent finished good, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete the work-in-process inventory, an estimate ofcosts to be incurred to sell the inventory and an estimate of a reasonable profit allowance for those manufac
turing and selling efforts.•
Raw materials and supplies— Estimated cost to replace the raw materials and supplies. The fair value of inventory will be recognized in our results of operations as the inventory is sold. Based on internal forecasts and estimates of
 months of inventory on hand, weexpect that the acquisition date inventory will be substantially sold and recognized in 
Cost of sales over a weighted-average estimated period of approximately eight months after the acquisition date.

    Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the estimate of the 
fair value of inventory include stage of completion, costs to complete, costs to disposeand selling price. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.
Property, Plant and Equipment 
—The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment is determined using a variety of valuation approaches, depending on the nature of the asset and the quality of available information. The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment was primarily determined as follows:
•
Land–– Market, a sales comparison approach that measures value of an asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of  comparable property.•
Buildings, Machinery and equipment and Furniture and fixtures —Replacement cost, an approach that measures the value of an asset by es timating the cost to acquire orconstruct comparable assets. For buildings that are not highly specialized or that could be income producing if leased to a third party, we also considered market and
income factors.
•
Construction in progress— Replacement cost, generally assumed to equal historical book value. The amounts recorded for the major components of acquired property, plant and equipment are as follows:
(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  Useful Lives(Years)
 Amounts RecognizedAs of Acquisition Date
Land
     $111 Buildings
  33—50  556 Machinery and equipment
  8—20  1,060 Furniture, fixtures and other
  3—12 1/2 141 Construction in progress
     542 Total Property, plant and equipment
     $2,410 The fair value of property, plant and equipment will be recognized in our results of operations over the expected useful life of the
 individual depreciable assets.Some of the more significant inputs, estimates and assumptions inherent in the estimate of 
the fair value of property, plant and equipment include the nature, age, condition orlocation of the land, buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and construction in progress, as applicable, as well as the estimate of
 market and replacementcost and the determination of the appropriate valuation premise, in-use or in-exchange. The in-use valuation premise assesses the value of an asset when used in combination
with other assets (for example, on an installed basis), while the in-exchange valuation assesses the value of an asset on a s
tand alone basis. All of these judgments andestimates can materially impact our results of operations.
Identifiable Intangible Assets 
— The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets generally is determined using an income approach. This method starts with a forecastof all of the expected future net cash flows associated with 
the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects therisk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets is composed of finite-lived developed technology rights with a weighted-average life of approximately 17 years ($7.7
billion); other finite-lived identifiable intangible assets with a weighted-average life of approximately 12 years ($550 million); and IPR&D assets ($995 million). For information
about our identifiable intangible assets, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 10. Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill: Identifiable Intangible Assets . As of the acquisition date, we recognized IPR&D assets of $660
 million for biosimilar programs and $335 million for sterile injectable programs.Biosimilar IPR&D Acquired Assets 
: •
In order to eliminate certain redundancies in Pfizer’s biosimilar drug products pipeline created as a result of the acquisition of Hospira, in September 2015 we opted toreturn to Celltrion Inc. and Celltrion Healthcare, Co., Ltd. (collectively Celltrion) rights that Hospira had previously acquired to potential biosimilars to Rituxan 
® (rituximab)and Herceptin 
® (trastuzumab). In connection with the return of these rights, we wrote-off these IPR&D assets, totaling $170 million. See the “Product Developments—Biopharmaceutical” section of this Financial Review and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
for additional information. •
The higher value remaining biosimilar IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira have been submitted to the FDA for approval and include the following potential biosimilars for(i) epoetin alfa (treatment of anemia in dialysis and oncology applications) and (ii) infliximab (rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal disorders). These biosimi
lars andfilgrastim (oncology) are already available in certain markets outside the U.S. Filgrastim in the U.S. market and other biosimilar IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira are in
late-stage development. See the “Product Developments––Biopharmaceutical” section of this Financial Review for additional information about these programs.
Sterile Injectable IPR&D Acquired Assets:
•
The sterile injectable IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira are in various therapeutic areas including anti-infectives, oncology, cardiovascular and neurology, among others.The sterile injectable IPR&D assets are in various stages of development with anticipated launch dates across 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The fair value of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets will be recognized in our results of operations over the expected useful life of the individual assets.

    Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the estimate of the 
fair value of identifiable intangible assets include all assumptions associated withforecasting product profitability from the perspective of a market participant.
Specifically:
•
Revenue—We use historical, forecast, industry or other sources of market data including estimates of sales volume, selling prices, market penetration, market share andyear-over-year growth rates over the product’s life cycle.
•
Cost of sales, Sales and marketing expenses, General and administrative expenses—We use historical, forecast, industry or other sources of market data to estimate thecosts associated with the identifiable intangible asset over the product’s life cycle.
•
R&D expenses—In the case of approved products, we estimate the appropriate level of ongoing R&D support, and for unapproved compounds, we estimate the amountand timing of costs to develop the R&D into viable products.
•
Estimated life of the asset—We assess the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory oreconomic barriers to entry, expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset, as well as obsolescence fac
tors and estimated contractrenewal rates.
•
I nherent risk—We use a discount rate that is primarily based on the weighted-average cost of capital with an additional premium to reflect the risks associated with thespecific intangible asset, such as country risks (political, inflation, currency and property risks) and commercial risks. In addition, for unapproved assets, an additional risk
factor is added for the risk of technical and regulatory success, called the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS).
•
The discount rates used in the intangible asset valuations ranged from 11% to 16%, and the estimated cash flows were projected over periods extending up to 20 years ormore. For IPR&D assets, the PTRS rates ranged from 44% to 88%
. Within this broad range, we recorded approximately $20 million of assets with a PTRS of 44%, $220million of assets with a PTRS of 45% to 75% and $755 million of assets with a PTRS
 above 75% ($585 million after the write-off of the acquired biosimilar IPR&D assetsdiscussed above). All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.
For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the
 fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product.Contingencies

Calculation not meaningful.Revenues—Overview
Total revenues were 
$48.9 billion in 2015 , a decrease of 2% compared to 2014 , which reflects an operational increase of $3.0 billion, or 6%, more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $3.8 billion, or 8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The operational increase was primarily the result of:
•
the performance of several key products in developed markets, including the continued strong uptake of Prevnar 13 among adults (largely in the U.S.), Ibrance (nearly all inthe U.S.), Eliquis, Lyrica (GIP) (primarily in the U.S. and Japan), Xeljanz (primarily in the U.S.), Viagra (GIP) (primarily in the U.S.) and Nexium 24HR (primarily in the U.S.)
(collectively, up approximately $4.1 billion);
•
inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.5 billion;•
a 7% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, reflecting continued strong operational growth, primarily from Prevenar 13, Lipitor and Enbrel (upapproximately $810 million); and
•
inclusion of the vaccines acquired from Baxter of $178 million,partially offset by:
•
the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December 2014 and certain other developed markets (downapproximately $1.8 billion), and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica (GEP) in certain developed Europe markets (down approximately $420 million), for Zyvox in the U.S. (down
approximately $420 million), for Rapamune in the U.S. (down approximately $120 million) and for certain other products (collectively, down approximately $530 million);
•
the performance of certain other products in developed markets and BeneFIX in the U.S. (collectively, down approximately $370 million); and•
the termination of the Spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries (down approximately $100 million).Total revenues were 
$49.6 billion in 2014 , a decrease of 4% compared to 2013 , which reflects an operational decrease of $1.1 billion, or 2%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $912 million, or 2%, in 
2014 compared to 2013 . The operational decrease was primarily the result of: •
the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada (approximately $1.4 billion);2015 Financial Report    
 
 19
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    •
the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA, Celebrex and Geodon in the U.S., Viagra in most major European markets, andAricept and Lyrica in Canada (aggregate decline of approximately $937 million) and certain other products(approximately $300 million);
•
the continued erosion of branded Lipitor in the U.S. and most other developed markets due to generic competition and the operational decline of certain products, includingNorvasc, Effexor, atorvastatin, Metaxalone, Zosyn/Tazocin, Ziprasidone, Genotropin, Tygacil, Centrum, Advil and V
fend (approximately $938 million); and•
the ongoing termination of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $490 million),partially offset by:
•
the operational growth of certain products in certain developed markets, including Lyrica, Prevnar, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xalkori, Inlyta and Nexium 24HR in the U.S. as a resultof its May 2014 launch, among others (approximately $1.8 billion); and
•
a 7% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets (approximately $900 million), including strong operational growth from Prevenar as well as from Lipitor,primarily in China, and from Enbrel, primarily in Latin America.
See the “Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights” section of this Financial Report for information about (i) recent losses of product exclusivity impacting
product revenues, (ii) recent and expected losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues and (iii) losses and expected losses of product exclusivity in 
2016 . In addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. For additional information, see 
the “Patents and OtherIntellectual Property Rights” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 2015
 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have significant operations outside the U.S., with revenues exceeding $500 million in the following number of countries:
The U.S. and Japan are our two largest national markets:
Revenues by Market
 
  
Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one
month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns o
f utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customerstocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but
cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be
 assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptlyinvestigated.
Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period tha
t the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent rebates, chargebacks and sales allowances to government agencies, wholesalers/distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical
products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for 
the reporting period and, as such, knowledge and judgment of marketconditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year

    individual product growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of
 our future experience, ourresults could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated
 with U.S.Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual
and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because
 of this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporaterevisions of several prior quarters.

erformance for specific products or sales milestones.(c) 
 Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) 
 Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.(e)
 
For 2015 , associated with the  following segments: GIP ( $4.3 billion ); VOC ( $1.5 billion ); and GEP ( $9.1 billion ). For 2014 , associated with the  following segments: GIP ( $3.3 billion ); VOC ( $1.2 billion ); and GEP ( 
$9.1 billion ). For 2013 , associated with the  following segments: GIP ( $2.8 billion ); VOC ( $1.0 billion ); and GEP ( $8.9 billion ). The total deductions from revenues for 2015 increased 10% compared to 2014, primarily as a result of:
•
an increase in chargebacks from certain Innovative Business products, GEP products including products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. during 2015, as well as theaddition in 2015 of Hospira sterile injectables, which are subject to chargebacks; and
•
an increase in Medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of updated estimates of sales related to these programs, and, a decrease in ManagedMedicaid estimated rebates in the second quarter of 2014,
partially offset by:
•
a decrease in sales allowances primarily in Asia and Europe. In Asia, the decrease is due to lower Lipitor sales and the end of a partnership arrangement for Caduet. InEurope, price declines primarily on GEP products were driven by government decrees that progressively reduce pricing on products that have lost exclusivity.

We recorded direct product sales of more than $1 billion for each of seven products in 2015, and for each o
f ten products in 2014 and 2013 . We recorded more than $1 billion in Alliance revenues in 
2015 (primarily Eliquis) and 2013 . These direct product sales and alliance revenues represent 44% of our revenues in 2015 , 52% of our revenues in 2014 
and 52% of our revenues in 2013 . See the Revenues—Major Products section of this Financial Review for additional information. 2015 v. 2014
See the 
Revenues — Overview section of this Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income for a discussion of performance of worldwide revenues. Geographically,
•
in the U.S., revenues increased $2.6 billion , or 14% , in 2015, compared to 2014 , reflecting, among other things: ◦
the performance of several key products, including Prevnar 13 primarily in adults (up approximately $1.9 billion), Ibrance (which was launched in the U.S. in February2015, up approximately $720 million), as well as Lyrica (GIP), Eliquis, Xeljanz, Viagra (GIP) and Nexium 24HR (collectively, up approximately $1.0 billion in 
2015 ), and ◦
the inclusion of four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations of $1.2 billion in 2015 , partially offset by:
◦
losses of exclusivity and associated multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December 2014 (down approximately $1.6 billion in 2015 ); ◦
the loss of exclusivity for Zyvox and Rapamune, as well as the termination of our Spiriva co-promotion collaboration (collectively, down approximately $620 million in2015 
); and ◦
the performance of Lipitor and BeneFIX (collectively, down approximately $160 million in 2015 ). •
in our international markets, revenues decreased $3.4 billion , or 11% , in 2015, compared to 2014 . Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted international revenues by approximately $3.8 billion, or 12% in 2015. Operationally, revenues increased by $402 million or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting, among other things:
◦
the operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, reflecting continued strong operational growth primarily from the Innovative Products business, includingPrevenar and Enbrel, among other products, and Lipitor (up approximately $600 million in 
2015 ); ◦
higher revenues in developed markets for Eliquis and Lyrica (GIP), as well as from vaccines acquired in December 2014 from Baxter (in Europe) (collectively, upapproximately $590 million in 
2015 ); and ◦
the inclusion of three months of legacy Hospira international operations of $270 million in 2015 , partially offset by:
◦
lower revenues in developed markets for Lyrica (GEP), Celebrex, Inspra and Viagra (GEP) as a result of the loss of exclusivity, as well as the performance of Lipitor andNorvasc in developed markets, and Zosyn/Tazocin in emerging markets (collectively, down approximately $1.0 billion in

See the 
Revenues — Overview section of this Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income for a discussion of performance of worldwide revenues. Geographically,
•
in the U.S., revenues decreased $1.2 billion or 6% in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting, among other things:◦
lower Alliance revenues, primarily due to Enbrel, reflecting the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement in October 2013 (down approximately$1.3 billion in 2014), and Spiriva, reflecting the final-year terms, and termination on April 29, 2014, of the co-promotion collaboration, which, per the terms of the
collaboration agreement, resulted in a decline of our share of Spiriva revenue (down approximately $395 million in 2014); and
◦
lower revenues from Detrol LA due to loss of exclusivity (down approximately $321 million in 2014), Celebrex due to loss of exclusivity in December 2014 (downapproximately $198 million), and lower revenues from Lipitor (down approximately $191 mill
ion in 2014),partially offset by:
◦
the strong performance of Lyrica (up approximately $352 million in 2014) as well as the growth of Prevnar, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Xalkori and Inlyta (collectively, upapproximately $760 million in 2014).
•
in our international markets, revenues decreased $778 million, or 2%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $912 million in 2014, or 3%. Operationally, revenues increased slightly by $134 million, in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting, among other things:
◦
higher operational revenues for Lipitor in China, Lyrica in developed markets, Enbrel outside Canada, and the performance of recently launched products Eliquis,Xalkori, and Inlyta (collectively, up approximately $941 million in 2014); and
◦
the operational growth of Prevenar and Xeljanz (collectively, up approximately $228 million in 2014),partially offset by:
◦
the operational decline of certain products, including Norvasc, Zithromax, Xalabrands, Detrol, Effexor and Chantix/Champix, in developed international markets, andSutent in China (collectively, down approximately $320 million in 2014);
◦
lower revenues as a result of the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for Viagra in most major European markets and Lyrica in Canada(collectively, down approximately $248 million in 2014);
◦
lower Alliance revenues (down approximately $218 million in 2014, excluding Eliquis), primarily due to the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaborationagreement for Enbrel in Canada, the ongoing termination of the Spiriva collaboration agreement in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity for Aricept in Canada and the
termination of the co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan in December 2012; and
◦
the continued erosion of branded Lipitor in most international developed markets (down approximately $197 million in 2014).In 2014, international revenues represented 62% of total revenues, compared to 61% in 2013. 
Excluding foreign exchange, international revenues in 2014 represented 62% oftotal revenues, compared to 62% in 2013.

Prevnar/Prevenar 13 (V), is our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of certain types of pneumococcal disease. Overall, worldwide revenues forPrevnar/Prevenar 13 increased 
46% operationally in 2015 , compared to 2014 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues of 6% in 2015, compared to 
2014 . In the U.S., revenues for Prevnar increased 
87% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , mainly due to continued strong uptake among adults following the positive recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use in adults aged 65 and older in the third
quarter of 2014 and the success of the commercial programs which helped to maximize vaccinations across all channels. We believe the “catch-up” opportunity (i.e., the
opportunity to reach adults aged 65 and older who have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar) in adults in the U.S.
 will continue to be large given currentdemographics and aging trends. However, the remaining population of adults aged 65 years and older will likely require additional effort to capture. As a result, the
opportunity will moderate over time as this “catch-up” opportunity becomes fully realized.
Internationally, revenues for Prevenar increased 
9% operationally in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily reflecting increased volume in emerging markets primarily due to Prevenar’s inclusion in additional national immunization programs in certain emerging markets. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of
13% in 2015, compared to 
2014 . In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use
 to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includespneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the
 CDCand U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. As with other
vaccines, the CDC regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the CDC announced formally that it will conduct
this review in 2018. Currently, we are working with a number of U.S. investigators to monitor the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes
included in Prevnar 13 and continue to observe trends.
In March 2015, the European Commission approved an expanded indication for the use of Prevenar 13 for the prevention o
f pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcalserotypes in the vaccine in adults aged 18 years and older. The Summary of Product Characteristics has also been updated 
to include efficacy data from our landmarkCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA), which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in first episodes of vaccine-type
pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including non-invasive/non-bacteremic CAP, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults aged 65 and older.

Lyrica (GEP (revenues from all of Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia)/GIP (all other revenues)) is indicated in the U.S. for three neuropathic pain conditions,fibromyalgia and adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. In certain markets outside the U.S., indications include neuropathic pain (peripheral and
central), fibromyalgia, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. Worldwide revenues for Lyrica were relatively flat operationally in 
2015 , compared to 
2014 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues of 6% in 2015 , compared to 2014 . In the U.S., revenues increased 
15% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , driven by price and volume increases, and investment in direct-to-consumer advertising combined with strong field force performance, partially offset by higher rebates.
Internationally, Lyrica revenues decreased 
11% operationally in 2015 , compared to 2014 , due to losses of exclusivity in certain developed Europe markets, partially offset by operational growth primarily in Japan. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 13% in 
2015 , compared to 2014 . Worldwide revenues from Lyrica in our GIP segment increased 
13% operationally in 2015 , compared to 2014, and in our GEP segment, revenues from Lyrica decreased 23%

Eliquis (apixaban) (GIP) is being jointly developed and commercialized by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). The two companies share commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. In April 2015, we signed an agreement with BMS to transfer 
full commercialization rights in certain smaller marketsto us, beginning in the third quarter of 2015. BMS supplies the product 
to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is partof the Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC) market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options 
to warfarin in appropriate patients. Eliquis(apixaban) is approved for multiple indications in major markets around the world:
◦
to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF);◦
for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy; and◦
for the prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE, in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.The NOAC class penetration continues to expand across key markets. Eliquis has become the most prescribed oral anticoagulant in new to brand prescriptions among
cardiologists in the U.S., Japan, and several other markets. Eliquis share uptake with primary care physicians has also been strong, following the launch, in the fourth
quarter of 2014, of the treatment indications for DVT and P

    PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS—BIOPHARMACEUTICAL
We continue to invest in R&D to provide potential future sources of revenues through the
 development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line andalliance products. Notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or
any of our other products in development.
We continue to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline
that will deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial
promise, innovating new capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of
innovation and productivity. To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and
inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. Another area of focus is biosimilars. With the acquisition
of Hospira, we have expanded our biosimilars pipeline and added R&D capabilities for sterile injectables and infusion systems.
A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline, including assets from the Hospira acquisition, was published on February 2, 2016 and is available at
www.pfizer.com/pipeline. It includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as
mechanism of action for candidates from Phase 2 through registration.

al information on the data within the current tafamidis NDA. We continue to work with the FDA to define a path forward.In February 2008, the FDA advised it expected to convene an advisory committee pending responses to
 the “approvable letters” for the Viviant (bazedoxifene) NDAs for thetreatment and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, which were received in December 2007 and May 2008. In view of the approval of Duavee (conjugated

including Inflectra 
™ (infliximab) for patients with autoimmune diseases. In Europe, Inflectra has now launched in 36 markets. Celltrion possesses the right to commercialize itsinfliximab product in the same European markets as Hospira. We have exclusive commercialization rights from Celltrion to their infliximab product in the U.S., Canada and
certain other territories. In August 2014, Celltrion submitted a potential infliximab biosimilar for FDA approval in the U.S., and in February 2016, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory

Cost of sales 
increased 1% in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to:•
an increase in sales volumes due to (i) the inclusion of four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations and thevaccine portfolio operations acquired from Baxter in fiscal 2015, both of which are comprised of inventory measured at fair value on the acquisition date (approximately $2.1

•
non-recurring charges of $72 million related to manufacturing plant pension obligations and $72 million related to inventory impairment in Venezuela in 2015 related to theforeign currency change described in the “Global Economic Conditions—Venezuela Operations” section in this Financial Review,
partially offset by:
•
favorable foreign exchange of 10% in 2015;•
a change in the profit deferred in inventory relating to inventory that had not been sold to third parties resulting in a non-cash benefit of $306 million; and, to a lesser extent•
manufacturing efficiencies; and•
a decrease in royalty expense associated with products that recently lost marketing exclusivity.The increase in 
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues in 2015, compared to 2014 , was primarily due to: •

an increase in alliance revenues which have no associated cost of sales.2014 v. 2013
Cost of sales increased as a percentage of 
Revenues in 2014, compared to the same period in 2013. These increases are primarily due to the impact of losses of exclusivity and unfavorable changes in product mix, resulting from, among other things, the loss of Enbrel alliance revenue after October 31,
 2013, when the co-promotion term of thecollaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada expired, and the loss of Spiriva alliance revenue in the U.S. as o

 2015 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Description of Research and Development Operations
Innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable.
Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations––Research Units, within our Worldwide Research and Development organization, are generally
responsible for research assets (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept); Business Units are generally responsible for development assets (assets that
 haveachieved proof-of-concept); and science-based and other platform-services organizations (for technical support and other services). For additional information by operating
segment, see the “Analysis of Operating Segment Information” section of this Financial Review.
We take a holistic approach to our R&D operations and manage the operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. Specifically, a
single committee, co-chaired by members of our R&D and commercial organizations, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our R&D projects and for seeking to
ensure that our company is focusing its R&D resources in the areas where we believe that we can be most successful and maximize our return on investment. We believe that
this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.
Our Research Units are organized in a variety of ways (by therapeutic area or combinations of therapeutic areas, by discipline, by location, etc.) to enhance flexibility,
cohesiveness and focus. Because of our structure, we can rapidly redeploy resources within a Research Unit between various projects as necessary because the workforce
shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.
Our science-based and other platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurs, provide technical expertise and other services to the
various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry, Drug Safety, and Development Operations, and
non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology and Finance. As a result, within each of these 
functions, we are able to migrate resources amongprojects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react
 quickly in response to evolving needs.Generally, we do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do
 not manage a significant portion of ourR&D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as
 conditions change, we believethat any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.

decreased 8% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , and 12% in 2014 , compared to 2013 , primarily due to assets that became fully amortized at the end of their estimated useful lives. The decrease in 
Amortization of intangible assets in 2015 was partially offset by purchase accounting charges of approximately $161 million pre-tax related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired from Hospira.

    In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We
 expect to generate $800million of annual cost synergies by 2018 in connection with the Hospira acquisition. Based on our past experience, the one-time costs to generate 
the synergies are expectedto be approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 million in 2015 associated with the return of acquired in-process research and development rights), incurred for up to
a three-year period post-acquisition.
In early 2014, we announced that we would be incurring costs in 2014-2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost-
reduction/productivity initiatives. We also have an ongoing manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization initiative underway. For information about these
programs and expected total costs, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost- Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
. The expected ongoing annual cost savings associated with the above-mentioned programs (but not including expected cost savings associated with the Hospira acquisition), in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately 
$2.4 billion by the end of 2016. The expected costs and cost savings in 2016 associated with these activities, as
 well as the Hospira acquisition, are reflected in our financial guidance for 2016. See also the“Our Financial Guidance for 2016” section of this Financial Review.
In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity
and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

•
a decrease in the favorable impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit as compared to 2013;•
the non-recurrence of the U.S. tax benefits of approximately $430 million, representing tax and interest, resulting from a settlement with the IRS with respect to audits of theWyeth tax returns for the year 2006 through date of acquisition; and
•
a decrease in 2014 of the favorable impact of the resolution of certain tax positions, pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities, and from the expiration ofcertain statutes of limitations as compared to 2013.
Changes in Tax Laws
On February 28, 2013, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No.
 2-2013, amending Sections 2101 and 2102 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994,which provided for an excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154) 
. The excise tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and theiraffiliates from their Puerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in ef
fect from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in2011 to 1% in 2016. Act No. 2-2013 extended the
 excise tax through 2017 and, effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. The impact ofAct No. 2-2013 is being recorded in 
Cost of sales and Provision for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 2016 have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2016.
On December 18, 2015, the President of the United Sta
tes signed into law the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the 2015 Act), which generally provides forthe temporary or permanent extension, retroactive to January 1, 2015, of certain tax bene
fits and credits that had expired, including the U.S. R&D tax credit, which wasextended permanently. Given the enactment date of the 2015
 Act, the benefit related to our 2015 R&D spending was recorded in 2015. All expected impacts in 2016 havebeen reflected in our financial guidance for 2016.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
For information about our discontinued operations, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 2D. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Divestitures . ADJUSTED INCOME
General Description of Adjusted Income 
MeasureAdjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
performance measure. We report Adjusted income, and certain components of Adjusted income, in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery,
development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, consumer healthcare (OTC) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement
elements. We have defined Adjusted income as 
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income components as 
Revenues, Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other (income)/deductions––net 
each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. The Adjusted income measure and the Adjusted income component
measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S
. GAAP net income or U.S. GAAP net income components.The Adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for Pfizer. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other
performance metrics. The following are examples of how the Adjusted income measure is utilized:
•
senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income basis;•
our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income basis; and•
senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this Adjusted income measure. Adjusted income is the performance metric utilized in the determinationof bonuses under the Pfizer Inc. Executive Annual Incen
tive Plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) for purposes ofInternal Revenue Code Section 162(m). Subject to the Section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based
 on the performance measured by threefinancial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding. The pool
applies to the bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the ELT members and other members of senior management. In
addition, commencing with the 2015 Performance Share Awards, adjusted operating income will be one of the measures utilized to determine payout. Adjusted operating
income is derived from Adjusted income.
Despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Adjusted income is a non-GAAP 
financial measure that has nostandardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors.
 Because of its non-standardized definition, Adjusted income (unlikeU.S. GAAP net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of
 similar measures of other companies. Adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fullyunderstand how management assesses performance.
2015 Financial Report    
 
 35
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    We also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the Adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process
solely to this metric. A limitation of the Adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as 
the effects ofan acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We
also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its
effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to
 a group of pharmaceutical industry peers (pre-2015) or a publiclytraded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.
See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted
 information for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 below. Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These
impacts, primarily associated with Pharmacia Corporation (acquired in 2003), Wyeth (acquired in 2009), King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired in 2011) and Hospira, Inc.
(Hospira) (acquired in 2015), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the
increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to
the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore, 
the Adjusted income measure includes the revenuesearned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.
Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance tha
t is used bymanagement to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and
investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs
previously have been expensed.
However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This
component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this sec
tion. We have not factored in the impacts of any otherdifferences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does no
t intend to berepresentative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our research and development costs in total, and
 in the periods presented, mayhave been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs
 to manufacture may have been different. In addition, ourmarketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, 
there can be no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been thesame as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
Acquisition-Related Costs
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because
these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that
 were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. Foradditional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset
acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection
with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities.
For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the con
text of abusiness combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.
The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three
years of the transaction. Because of the need 
for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activitiescan be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the
 closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturingchanges are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA
 and/or other global regulatory authorities.Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such
operations such as the gains on the full disposition of our former Animal Health business (Zoetis) in June 2013. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to
 investorsbecause, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Resta
tementsdue to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect o
f the restated periods, but are presentedfor consistency across all periods.

 2015 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual
basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect o
f their unusual nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of ourongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect
 to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-
acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our global
commercial structure reorganization and our other non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses,
products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GAA
P; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain taxpositions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of
 those discussed in Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements—

esult of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business. The effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was favorably impacted by the change in the jurisdictional mix ofearnings as a result of oper
ating fluctuations in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decrease in the favorable impact of the resolution of certain tax positions, pertaining to prior years, with variousforeign tax authorities and fr
om the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, as well as a decrease in the favorable impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit compared to 2013.2015 Financial Report

    Total GIP revenues from emerging markets were 
$1.6 billion in 2015 , consistent with $1.6 billion in 2014 , reflecting 9% operational growth, which was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
•
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decreased 2.2 percentage points in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily driven by a decrease in royalty expense, favorable foreign exchange and an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales. The decrease in 
Cost of sales of 16% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in royalty expense.
•
The slight increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses in 2015 , compared to 2014 , reflects additional investment in Eliquis, Lyrica and certain other products, largely offset by favorable foreign exchange and reduced investment in certain other products.
•
The increase in Research and development expenses of 22% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily reflects the $295 million upfront payment to OPKO Health, Inc. made in the first quarter of 2015 and increased investment in certain late-stage pipeline programs, primarily bococizumab, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for certain
previously approved products.
•
The unfavorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net of 4% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily reflects a decrease in royalty-related income, partially offset by anincrease in our equity income from certain equity-method investments.
2014 vs. 2013:
•
Revenues decreased 3% in 2014 , compared to 2013. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on GI P revenues in 2014, compared to 2013. Revenuesdecreased by 2% operationally in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the following operational factors:
◦
the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada on October 31, 2013 (down approximately $1.4 billion in 2014);and
◦
loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in Canada in February 2013 (a decline of approximately $67 million in 2014),partially offset by:
◦
strong operational growth from Lyrica, primarily in the U.S. and Japan, and Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada, as well as the performance of recently launched products,including Eliquis, primarily in the U.S. and most other developed markets, and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S. (a combined increase of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014).
Total GIP revenues from emerging markets were 
$1.6 billion in 2014. •
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased 0.6 percentage points in 2014, compared to 2013, due to the loss o f Enbrel alliance revenue after October 31, 2013when the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada expired as well as an unfavorable change in product mix. The increase in 
Cost of sales 
primarily reflects an unfavorable change in product mix. •
Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased 13% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting increased investment in recently launched products and certain in- line products.
•
Research and development expenses increased 31% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting incremental investment in late-stage pipeline products. •
The favorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net of 93% in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily reflects an increase in royalty-related income, primarily due to royalties earned on sales of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada after October 31,
 2013. As noted above, on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement forEnbrel in the U.S. and Canada expired, and Pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period thereafter.

Total Equity , see the consolidated statements of equity. The changes in our asset and liability accounts as of 
December 31, 2015 , compared to December 31, 2014 , generally reflect, among other things, the impact of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of Hospira (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Acquisitions ), and decreases due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, some of which impacts were significant.
The following explanations exclude the impact of the acquisition of Hospira and foreign exchange:
•
For Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, the change also reflects the timing of sales and collections in the normal course of business. •
For Inventories, the change also reflects an increase to inventory, resulting from a change in the profit deferred in inventory relating to inventory tha t had not been sold tothird parties, 
inventory acquired as part of the acquisition of Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines, recorded at acquisition-date fair value as well as inventory builds in the normal course of business, partially offset by planned inventory reductions.
•
For Other current assets, the change also reflects the decrease in the receivables associated with our derivative financial instruments as well as the timing of receipts and payments in the normal course of business.
•
For Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation, the change also reflects depreciation, mainly offset by capital additions. •
For Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization , the change also reflects amortization and to a lesser extent impairments, partially offset by identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines.

 Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Acquisitions.•
For Trade accounts payable, the change also reflects the timing of purchases and payments in the normal course of business. •
For Accrued compensation and related items, the change also reflects a higher bonus accrual attributable to performance and a change in the structure of  ourcompensation whereby fixed compensation for certain previously non-bonus eligible colleagues was reduced and replaced with an equal amount of variable compensation
tied to the performance of the Company and is paid annually.
•
For Other current liabilities , the change also reflects an increase in the payables associated with our derivative financial instruments, a net increase in legal-related liabilities, mainly the accrual for the agreement in principle to resolve claims relating to Protonix, partially offset by payments of certain legal claims, as well as the timing of
other payments and accruals in the normal course of business. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
—Note 17A4. Commitments and Contingencies: Legal Proceedings—Government Investigations.
•
For Pension benefit obligations, net, and Postretirement benefit obligations, net , the change reflects, among other things, a $1.0 billion voluntary pension contribution in January 2015, an increase in our discount rate assumptions used in the measurement of the plan obligations, a $507 million reduction in our U.S. Postretirement Plan
obligation due to a plan amendment approved in June 2015 that introduced a cap on costs 
for certain groups within the plan, and a rise in the comparative strength of theU.S. dollar, as compared to other currencies. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

Calculation not meaningful.In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the line item, 
Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures , is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or out
flows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements.Accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our consolidated balance sheets.
Operating Activities
2015 v. 2014
Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$14.5 billion in 2015 , compared to $16.9 billion in 2014 . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the change in operating earnings as well as a $1.0 billion voluntary pension contribution in January 2015, and the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course
of business, including higher payments related to certain liabilities associated with legal matters, partially offset by the upfront cash payment of $850 million in 2014 in
connection with our collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA.
In 2015, the change in the line item called 
Other adjustments, net, primarily reflects the non-cash changes in the equity losses related to the Hisun and ViiV equity-method investments.
In 
2015 and 2014 , the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, accounts payable, accrued compensation and o
ther current and non-current liabilities. For2015, this line item also includes the adjustments necessary to reflect the payments of certain liabilities associated with legal matters accrued in prior periods, including
Neurontin-related matters, partially offset by the deferral of an upfront payment received as part of our tanezumab collaborative arrangement. For additional information about
accounts receivable, see also the “Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: Accounts Receivable” section of this Financial Review. For additional information
about our legal accruals, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net. 2014 v. 2013
Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$16.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $17.7 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects operating earnings impacted by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, as well as the upfront cash payment
 of $850 million in connection withour collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

2015 v. 2014
Our net cash used in investing activities was 
$3.0 billion in 2015 , compared to $5.7 billion in 2014 . The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
net redemptions of investments of $14.6 billion in 2015 , compared to net purchases of investments of $4.2 billion in 2014 , partially offset by:
•
cash paid of $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired, in 2015 for the acquisition of Hospira (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment

    2014 v. 2013
Our net cash used in investing activities was 
$5.7 billion in 2014 , compared to $10.5 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
net purchases of investments of $4.2 billion in 2014, compared to $9.4 billion in 2013,partially offset by:
•

2015 v. 2014
Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$10.2 billion in 2015 , compared to $10.0 billion in 2014 . The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
net principal payments on long-term debt of $3.0 billion in 2015, compared to net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.4 billion in 2014; and •
purchases of common stock of $6.2 billion in 2015 , compared to $5.0 billion in 2014 , partially offset by:
•
net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $4.3 billion in 2015 , compared to net payments on short-term borrowings of $1.8 billion in 2014 . 2014 v. 2013
Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$10.0 billion in 2014 , compared to $15.0 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
purchases of common stock of $5.0 billion in 2014, compared to $16.3 billion in 2013,partially offset by:
•
net proceeds from borrowings of $548 million in 2014, compared to net proceeds from borrowings of $6.0 billion in 2013; and•
proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.0 billion in 2014, compared to $1.8 billion in 2013.Supplemental Schedule of Non-Cash Investing and Financing Info
rmationIn 2015, we exchanged $1.7 billion debt of our recently acquired subsidiary Hospira for virtually the same amount of Pfizer Inc. debt.
In 2013, we had the following non-cash transactions:
•
we sold Zoetis common stock for Pfizer common stock valued at $11.4 billion;•
we exchanged Zoetis common stock for the retirement of Pfizer commercial paper issued in 2013 for $2.5 billion;•
we exchanged Zoetis senior notes for the retirement of Pfizer commercial paper issued in 2012 for $1.0 billion;•
we transferred certain product rights, valued at $1.2 billion, to an equity-method investment (Hisun Pfizer); and•
we contributed an investment, valued at $447 million, in connection with the resolution of a legal matter (Quigley).For further details on the 2015 debt exchange, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

: Equity-Method Investments. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. Due to
our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we
have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:
•
the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;•
investments in our business;•
dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•
share repurchases;•
the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
paying down outstanding debt;2015 Financial Report

    •
contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•
business-development activities.For additional information about our share-purchase plans, see the “Share-Purchase Plans and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement” section of this Financial Review.
Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market
conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our 
financial investments. Both short-termand long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified and available
-for-sale debt securities.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resou
rcesThe following table provides certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7. Financial Instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.(b)
 
Selected net financial assets decreased during 2015 as net cash provided by operating activities decreased, and cash paid for the Hospira acquisition, dividend payments and share purchases, among otherthings, more than offset the re
demptions/sales, net of purchases, of investments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. For additional information, see the “Analysis of the Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows 
” section of this Financial Review.(c)
 
The presentation of all deferred taxes as noncurrent in accordance with a new accounting standard that we adopted at December 31, 2015 impacted working capital and the ratio of current assets to currentliabilities. Net current deferred tax 
assets of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 were reclassified to noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, as appropriate (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 1B. Adoption of Ne
w Accounting Standards ). The decrease in working capital is due to the acquisition of Hospira, as well as the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course ofbusiness. For additional informati
on on the acquisition of Hospira, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreeme nts, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures,Equity-Method Investments and C

 Represents total Pfizer Inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “Analysis of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets ” and “ Analysis of the Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows 
” sections of this Financial Review.On May 15, 2014, we completed a public offering of $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
–– Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt 
). On June 3, 2013, we completed a public offering of $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. In
 addition, we repaid at maturity our 3.625% seniorunsecured notes, which had a balance of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012, and, in December 2013, we redeemed the aggregate principal amount of $1
.8 billion of our 5.50%senior unsecured notes that were due in February 2014.
Domestic and Internatio
nal Short-Term FundsMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of
 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. We generallyhold up to $10 billion of our short-term funds in U.S. tax jurisdictions. The amount of funds held in U.
S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and paymentsin the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. As part of
 our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor themix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. federal, state
 and local income taxpayments. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the
U.S., no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided.

    Accounts Receivable
We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets where economic conditions remain challenging
and uncertain. Historically, payments from a number of these European governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of
 sale. Specifically, wehave received limited payments in 2015 from the Greek government on outstanding receivables; the majority of such receivables pertain to 2015 revenues. Also, the
 Greekgovernment has restructured its debt to other third parties in the third quarter of 2015. 
Accordingly, we have adjusted our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect theseevents, and have $50 million in net receivables as of 
December 31, 2015 . Reported revenues from Greece for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $233 million. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on an analysis of the
 following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistencyof payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring
industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had about $772 million in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. Such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $66 million, were as follows: $39
million in Italy; $12 million in Portugal; $8 million in Greece; and $7 million in Spain.
Although certain European governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to
 appropriately balancerepayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.
We will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1C. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Estimates and Assumptions 
. Credit Ratings
Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any o
ther rating. Thepending combination with Allergan could result in a downgrade of our ratings.
The following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:

  Date of Last Rating Change
  Rating  Rating Outlook  Moody’s
  P-1  A1 Stable  October 2009 S&P
  A-1+  AA Negative Watch   November 2015 Debt Capacity
We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and
short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had access to $8.1 billion of lines of credit, of which $687 million 
expire within one year. Of these lines of credit, $7.9 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. Also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2020, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. Under the terms of a substantial majority of our line of credit
agreements, upon the merger with Allergan, the lenders under the agreements may elect to require immediate repayment of any amounts then outstanding and cancel 
theoutstanding lines of credit. We expect to either amend the existing credit agreements or secure new credit agreements to replace these
 agreements.Global Economic Conditions––Ge
neralThe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash
flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and
 will maintain, the abilityto meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As markets conditions change, we continue 
to monitor our liquidity position.Global Economic Conditions––Ven
ezuela OperationsOur Venezuela operations continue to operate with the U.S. dollar as the func
tional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy.On February 13, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3
 to 6.3 of Venezuelan currency to the U.S. dollar. We incurred a foreign currencyloss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets.
2015 Financial Report

Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    In the second quarter of 2015, the Venezuelan government identified three o
fficial rates of exchange. These are the CENCOEX rate of 6.3; the SICAD rate of 13.5 (as ofFebruary 2016); and the SIMADI rate of 200 (as of February 2016). News reports state
 the Venezuelan government announced that , effective February 18, 2016, theCENCOEX rate of 6.3 would be replaced by the rate of 10.0
; that the SICAD rate would cease to be offered; and, the operation of the SIMADI rate would change.  Recent conditions in Venezuela had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected
 to besettled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.3
, but at the SIMADI rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtainsignificant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects
 of the implementation of a fourth-quarter2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a restructuring charge of $39 million related to a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes
in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy. The effect of tha
t change in expectation was a foreign currency loss of $806 million included in Other (income)/deductions––net 
. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net. In addition, we had an inventory impairment loss of $72 million included in 
Cost of sales . We expect to use the SIMADI rate in 2016 
for remeasurement purposes of the remaining net assets, We cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of theVenezuelan currency or whether our use of the SIMADI official rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts
 and circumstances. Further, other potential actions by theVenezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in Venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and,
under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically.
As of December 31, 2015, our net monetary assets in Venezuela that
 are subject to revaluation totaled approximately $27 million (remeasured at the SIMADI 200 rate). OurVenezuela 
Revenues for 2015 are equivalent to approximately $34 million (converted using the SIMADI 200 rate). Contractual Obligations
Payments due under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, mature as follows:
 
     Years (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)

 Long-term debt consists of senior unsecured notes, including fixed and floating rate, foreign currency denominated, and other notes.(b)
 
Our calculations of expected interest payments incorporate only current period assumptions for interest rates, foreign currency translation rates and hedging strategies (see Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements— 
Note 7. Financial Instruments ), and assume that interest is accru ed through the maturity date or expiration of the related instrument.(c)
 
Includes expected payments relating to our unfunded U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans, postretirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Excludes amounts relating to our U.S. qualifiedpension plans and international
 pension plans, all of which have a substantial amount of plan assets, because the required funding obligations are not expected to be material and/or because such liabilities do notnecessarily reflect future cash paym
ents, as the impact of changes in economic conditions on the fair value of the pension plan assets and/or liabilities can be significant. In January 2016, we made a $1.0 billionvoluntary contribution to the U.S. 
qualified plans. We do not anticipate making any additional contributions to the U.S. qualified plans in 2016. Also, excludes $4.5 billion of liabilities rela ted to legal matters,employee terminations and t
he fair value of derivative financial instruments and other, most of which do not represent contractual obligations. See also our liquidity discussion above in this “Analysis of FinancialCondition, Liquidity and Ca
pital Resources” section, as well as the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 3. Restructuring Charges a nd Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives, Note 
7A. Financial Instruments: Selected Financial Assets and Liabilities, Note 11E. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans: Cash Flows, and Note 17. Commitments

 Includes operating and capital lease obligations.(e)
 
Includes agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administrationservices, and potential mileston
e payments deemed reasonably likely to occur.(f) 
 Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issuesand the resolution of thos
e issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to
occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization
milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.
In 
2016 , we expect to spend approximately $1.9 billion on property, plant and equipment. This represents an increase of approximately $500 million over 2015 capital spending in order to fund a full year of Hospira capital needs, as well as capital required to support the integration of the Hospira business, early-stage implementation of
changes to our infrastructure to align our operations to our business segments established in 2014, incremental manufacturing investment to address increasing regulatory
requirements as well as for business-driven capacity expansion. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs. Due to our significant operating
cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses,
 we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise inconnection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-
related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to
54
 
 2015 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications generally are subject to threshold
amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2015 , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant.
Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-
promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.
Share-Purchase Plans and Ac
celerated Share Repurchase AgreementOur December 2011 $10 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the first quarter of 2013. Our November 2012 $10 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the
fourth quarter of 2013. On June 27, 2013, we announced
 that the Board of Directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarterof 2015. On October 23, 2014, we announced 
that the Board of Directors had authorized an additional $11 billion share-purchase plan, and share repurchases commencedthereunder in January 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time.
On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (G
S&Co.) to repurchase shares of our common stock. Thisagreement was entered into under our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11,
 2015, we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 
151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. This agreement was completed in July 2015, and pursuant to the agreement’ssettlement terms, we elected to settle the agreement in cash and paid an additional 
$160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately $5.2 billion paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was $34.13 per share. For additional information, see
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 12. Equity . The following table provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including
our accelerated share repurchase agreement:

  182  165  563 Cost of purchase
  $6.2  $5.0  $16.3 (a) 
 Includes approximately 151 million shares purchased for $5.2 billion pursuant to the accelerated  share repurchase agreement as well as other share repurchases through year-end 2015.After giving effect to the accelerated share repurchase agreement, as well as other share repurchases through year-end 
2015 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately 
$16.4 billion at December 31, 2015 . In November 2015, we announced that, consistent with 2015, we expect 
to execute an approximately $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016.We anticipate additional future share repurchases to continue following the consummation of the pending combination with Allergan. The actual size and timing of any such
share repurchases will depend on actual and expected financial results.
Dividends on Common Stock
We paid dividends on our common stock of 
$6.9 billion in 2015 , $6.6 billion in 2014 and $6.6 billion in 2013 . In December 2015, our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2016 dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on March 2, 
2016 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 5, 2016 . The first-quarter 2016 cash dividend will be our 309 
th consecutive quarterly dividend.Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses and to seek to increase
shareholder value. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. The definitive merger agreement we entered into with Allergan in November 2015 includes a provision
that Pfizer may continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on Pfizer’s common stock of not more than $0.28
 per share per quarter (subject to annual adjustment, if any, ina manner consistent with past practice by Pfizer’s Board of Directors), consistent with past practice as to 
timing of declaration, record date and payment date. On December14, 2015, we declared a $0.30 dividend per share for the first quarter of 2016, which is in compliance with the definitive merger agreement. While the dividend level remains a
decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be evaluated in the context of fu
ture business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annualdividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events.
Pending Combination with Allergan
 plcOn November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland, under
which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion, based on
the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to 
the announcement) and certain other assumptions. Allerganshareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares by virtue of a share split, and Pfizer shareholders will have the option of
receiving one share of the combined company for each of their Pfizer shares or receiving cash instead of shares of the combined company for some or all of
 their Pfizershares, provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in 
the merger will not be less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion. In the event that elections to receive cashand shares in the merger would otherwise result in an aggregate of less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion of cash being paid out in the merger, then the share elections
and cash elections will be subject to proration. The completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second half
 of 2016, is subject to certain conditions, including receiptof regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and EU, the receipt of necessary approvals from both Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and the completion of
Allergan’s pending divestiture of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. The merger agreement also provides that the businesses of Pfizer
and Allergan will be combined under the existing Allergan entity, which, subject to approval by Allergan shareholders, will be renamed “Pfizer plc.”

    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not 
Adopted as of December 31, 2015 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards.The following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted: 
 Standard
 Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statementsor Other Significant Matters
 
         In November 2014, the FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued amended guidance related to
accounting for 
hybrid financial instruments 
 issued or held as investments.
 
The new guidance clarifies that for hybrid financialinstruments in the form of stock, the assessment of
whether the embedded derivative is clearly and closely
related to the host instrument must consider the
economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid
financial instrument, including the embedded derivative
feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting
from the host contract.
  January 1, 2016. 
We do not expect that the provisions ofthis new standard will have any
material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued
amended guidance related to disclosure of
uncertainties about the ability of an entity
to continue as a 
going concern .   The new guidance requires management of all entities toevaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and, as
necessary, to provide related footnote disclosures.
  December 31, 2016.Earlier application is
permitted.
 We do not expect that the provisions ofthis new standard will have any impact
on our consolidated financial
statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued an update
related to 
inventory .  
The new guidance requires that inventory be measuredat the lower of cost or net realizable value.
 
January 1, 2017. Earlierapplication is permitted as
of the beginning of an
interim or annual reporting
period.
  We do not expect the provisions of thisnew standard will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued amended
guidance related to 
revenue from contracts with customers 
. In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance
deferring the effective date of the revenue
recognition standard.
 
The new guidance introduces a new principles-basedframework for revenue recognition and disclosure.
 
January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is permitted
only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after
December 15, 2016,
including interim reporting
periods within that
reporting period.
 
We have not yet completed our finalreview of the impact of this guidance,
although we currently do not anticipate
a material impact on our revenue
recognition practices. We continue to
review variable consideration, potential
disclosures, and our method of
adoption to complete our evaluation of
the impact on our consolidated
financial statements. In addition, we
continue to monitor additional changes,
modifications, clarifications or
interpretations being undertaken by the
FASB, which may impact our current
conclusions.
In September 2015, the FASB issued an
update to its guidance on 
business combinations 
.  
The new guidance requires that an acquirer recognizeadjustments to provisional amounts identified during the
measurement period be recorded in the reporting period
determined. The new guidance also requires that the
acquirer records, in the same period’s financial
statements, the effect on earnings of changes in
depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if
any, as a result of the change to the provisional
amounts. These are calculated as if the accounting had
been completed as of the acquisition date. The new
guidance also requires separate presentation on the face
of the income statement, or disclosure within the notes
for the portion of the amount that would have been
recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of
the acquisition date.
  January 1, 2016. Effectivefor all adjustments made
to provisional amounts
reported for acquisitions
still in the measurement
stage as of the effective
date.
 
We will use this guidance for anyadjustments made after January 1,
2016 to any provisional amounts
reported for acquisitions, but do not
expect it to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

 Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statementsor Other Significant Matters
 
         In January 2016, the FASB issued anupdate to its guidance on recognition and
measurement of f 
i nancial assets and liabilities.
 
Among other things, the new guidance makes thefollowing targeted changes to existing guidance:
Requires equity investments (except those
accounted for under the equity method of accounting or
those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be
measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. However, an entity may
choose to measure equity investments that do not have
readily determinable fair values at cost minus
impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the
identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity
investments without readily determinable fair values by
requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.
When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment
exists, the investment is required to be measured at fair
value.
Requires separate presentation of financial assets
and financial liabilities by measurement category and
form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the
accompanying notes to the financial statements.
Clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a
valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to
available-for-sale securities in combination with the
entity’s other deferred tax assets.
  January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is not allowed
for the amendments in the
update, described here,
that have potential to
impact our consolidated
financial statements.
 
We are assessing the impact of theprovisions of this new guidance on our
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an
update to its guidance on 
leases .  
The new ASU provides guidance for both lessee andlessor accounting models. Among other things, the new
guidance requires that a right of use asset and a lease
liability be recognized for leases with a duration of
greater than one year.
 January 1, 2019. Earlierapplication is permitted
 
We have not yet completed our reviewof the impact of this guidance.
However, we anticipate recognition of
additional assets and corresponding
liabilities related to leases on our
balance sheet.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of anticipated
results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions
prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider
forward-looking statements, and are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except
 as required by law or bythe rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult
 any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports andour other filings with the SEC.
Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of
 our Annual Report on Form 10-K for theyear ended 
December 31, 2015 . We note these factors for investors as permitted by the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is notpossible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a
 complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.The operating segment information does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on
 income that each ofour operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.
This report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies typically are part of a larger body of
clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of 
the larger body of data. In addition, clinical trialdata are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient 
to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication foran in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.
Financial Risk Management
The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We
manage these financial exposures through operational means and through the use of third-party instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We operate globally and, as such, we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, as well as in our financial assets (investments) and liabilities
(borrowings). Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk.
On the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. See 
the “ Our Operating Environment — TheGlobal Economic Environment 
” section of this Financial Review for the key currencies in which we operate. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Where
foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.
With respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from short-term and long-term intercompany receivables and
payables, and, to a lesser extent, from short-term and long-term investments and debt, where the asse
ts and/or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than thefunctional currency of the business entity.
In addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments o
f our foreign business entities. In these cases,we may use foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.
For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Selected Financial Assets and Liabilities 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding
all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S.
 dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative tothe U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to depreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of 
December 31, 2015 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and on our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on 
Pfizer’s immediate andintermediate liquidity needs.
With respect to our investments, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but our strategy may change based on
 prevailing market conditions. Ourfloating-rate assets are subject to the risk that short-term interest rates may fall and, as a
 result, the investments would generate less interest income. Fixed-rate investmentsprovide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates. We sometimes use interest rate swaps in our financial investment portfolio.
60
 
 2015 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    With respect to our long-term borrowings, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but here too, we may change our strategy depending upon
prevailing market conditions. We generally issue debt with a fixed rate, and then use interest rate swaps to convert it into
 floating-rate debt as we deem appropriate in thecircumstances. This effective floating rate debt serves to offset some o
f the interest rate risks associated with our short-term and floating-rate investments.For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Selected Financial Assets and Liabilities 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in
interest rates as of 
December 31, 2015 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant. Contingencies
Legal Matters
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications (see Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies). Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding
the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/orour cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Tax Matters
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for tax matters (see Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements— 
Note 5D. Tax Matters: Tax Contingencies). We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of
 a tax benefit, we regularly monitor ourposition and subsequently recognize the tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that
 sufficiently raise the likelihood ofprevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a 
favorablesettlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on 
the results of audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings,statute of limitations expirations, changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to 
the “more-likely-than-not” standard.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potentialtax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such es
timates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or whenthe statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as
 discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formaladministrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
 our uncertain tax positions, and suchchanges could be significant.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management’s Report
We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in our 
2015 Financial Report. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and es
timates. We also accept responsibility for thepreparation of other financial information that is included in this document.
Report on Internal Control Ove
r Financial ReportingThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded asnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effec
t on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2015 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2015 . Pfizer Inc. acquired Hospira, Inc. on September 3, 2015, and management excluded from its assessment
 of the effectiveness of Pfizer Inc.’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2015, Hospira, Inc.’s and its subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $24.2 billion and total revenues of
$1.5 billion included in the consolidated financial statements of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of and for the year ended
 December 31, 2015.The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears in our

The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements
and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s
results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as,
when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management
and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed
under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.
In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part
of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant’s communications
with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence from Pfizer.
We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The
Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.
As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and
risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.
The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits.
The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular
and executive sessions to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of P
fizer’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting andcompliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the 
Board has approved, that the auditedfinancial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2015 , for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of 
Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2016 .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on theConsolidated Financial Statements
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and 
Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan andperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pfizer Inc
. and Subsidiary Companies as ofDecember 31, 
2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in 
Note 1B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted on a retrospective basis F ASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes classifying all deferred tax assets, liabilities and associated valuation allowances as non-current.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Pfizer Inc. and SubsidiaryCompanies’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective

 2015 Financial Report
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 
2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control 
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan andperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
 the assets ofthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.
In our opinion, Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2015 , based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Pfizer Inc. acquired Hospira, Inc. on September 3, 2015, and management excluded from its assessment
 of the effectiveness of Pfizer Inc.’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2015, Hospira, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $24.2 billion and total revenues of $1
.5 billion includedin the consolidated financial statements of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of and for 
the year ended December 31, 2015. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting of Pfizer Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hospira, Inc.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. andSubsidiary Companies as of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each  of theyears in the three-year period ended December 31, 
2015 , and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include our parent company and all subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The decision of
 whether or not to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economicor other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than vo
ting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the United States (U.S.), the financialinformation is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and
 for the year endedDecember 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions
among our businesses have been eliminated. Taxes paid on intercompany sales transactions are deferred until recognized upon sale of the asset to a third party.
In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, we performed certain reclassifications to conform to the
 current period presentation of all deferred taxes asnoncurrent in accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard (for additional information, see 
Note 1B ). We also performed certain other reclassifications in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 to conform to the current period presentation, none
 of which were material to our financial statements.On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan plc (Allergan), a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in
Ireland, under which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at 
$363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion 
, based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to the announcement) and certain other assumptions. While we have taken actions and incurred costs associated with the pending combination that are reflected in our financial statements, 
the pending combination with Allerganwill not be reflected in our financial statements until consummation. See 
Note 19 . for additional information. On September 3, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of
biosimilars. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira, and, in accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 
December 31, 2015 reflect four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations. Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer and its commercial operations are now included within the Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) segment. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira
entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps. See 
Note 2A for additional information. On June 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our Animal Health business (Zoetis), and recognized a gain of approximately 
$10.3 billion net of tax, in Gain on disposal of discontinued operations––net of tax 
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. The operating results o f this business through June 24,2013, the date of disposal, are reported as 
Income from discontinued operations––net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. For additional information, see 
Note 2D. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to
 rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.B. Adoption of New Acco
unting StandardsWe adopted a new accounting and disclosure standard as of January 1, 2015 that
 limits the presentation of discontinued operations to when the disposal of the businessoperation represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. This new standard is applied prospectively to all disposals
(or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
In 2015, we did not have any disposals within the scope of this new standard and
, therefore, there were no impacts to our consolidated financial statements from the adoptionof this new standard.
On December 31, 2015, we adopted a new accounting standard that requires all deferred tax assets and
 liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. Weelected to apply this new standard retrospectively. The impact of the change in presentation is tha
t all deferred tax assets and liabilities that were previously reported in currentassets and current liabilities, totaling net current deferred tax assets of 
$2.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 have been reclassified to noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, as appropriate. For additional information, see 
Note 5C. C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures, including amounts recorded anddisclosed in connection with acquisitions. These estimates and underlying assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated
statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues (such as rebates, chargebacks,
 sales allowances and sales returns), determining thecost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and
 estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies. On theconsolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, such as accounts receivable, investments, inventories, de
ferred taxassets, fixed assets and intangible assets (including acquired in-process research & development (IPR&D) assets), and estimates are used in determining the reported
amounts of liabilities, such as taxes payable, benefit obligations, accruals
72
 
 2015 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    for contingencies, rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns, and restructuring reserves, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If ourestimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted.
As future events and their effects cannot be
 determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events andcircumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject
 to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differfrom estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and
assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts
 and circumstances indicate the need forchange. Those changes generally will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis, unless they are required to be treated retrospectively under relevant
accounting standards. It is possible that others, applying reasonable judgment to the same fac
ts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimatedamounts.
D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. We
 account for acquired businesses using theacquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of 
theacquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance shee
t. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the considerationtransferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that
 do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S.GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date
until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . Amounts recorded in connection with an acquisition can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. E. Fair Value
We are often required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, we use fair
value extensively in the initial recognition of net assets acquired in a business combination, when measuring certain impairment losses and when accounting for and reporting
of certain financial instruments. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the
highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and af
ter the transfer.When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other thanquoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means
(Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Forinformation about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their
U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and we translate functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollarequivalents at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects 
that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet da
te, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions–– net 
, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.2015 Financial Report

    G. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Revenue Recognition 
—We record revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer. A t the time of sale, we also record estimates fora variety of revenue deductions, such as rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns. When we cannot reasonably estimate 
the amount of future sales returnsand/or other revenue deductions, we record revenues when the risk of product return and/or additional revenue deductions has been substantially eliminated.
Deductions from Revenues–– 
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the  same period that therevenues are recognized, and primarily represent rebates, chargebacks and sales allowances to government agencies, wholesalers/distributors and managed care
organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required
when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we record provisions for pharmaceutical Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid andactual prescriptions written during prior quarters. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This
experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to
Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut hole,” based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and
consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the
 coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends andfuture expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in 
formulary statusand rebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales withineach period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s to
tal unbudgetedpharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds, and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level
of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties) closely approximate actual as wesettle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; es
timated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time betweenshipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate o
f future returns, such as loss of exclusivity, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate thecost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.
Our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and
cash discounts totaled 
$3.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 , of which approximately $2.6 billion is included in Other current liabilities, $272 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities 
and approximately $1.1 billion is included against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts , in our consolidated balance sheet. Our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash
discounts totaled 
$3.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , of which approximately $2.0 billion is included in Other current liabilities, $300 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities 
and approximately $1.1 billion is included against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts , in our consolidated balance sheet. Total accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts
as of 
December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $500 million compared to December 31, 2014 , primarily due to the addition, in 2015, of Hospira accruals. Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can
 rely heavily on estimates andassumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Collaborative Arrangements— 
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o f thearrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts
received from our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded when our collaboration partners ship the product and title passes to their customer. The related expenses 
forselling and marketing these products are included in 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when our collaboration partners sell the product and title passes to their customers. All royalty payments to collaboration partners
are included in 
Cost of sales . Trade Accounts Receivable 
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
currently available information. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been
exhausted.

    H. Cost of Sales and Inventories
We carry inventories at the lower of cost or market. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
 regularly reviewour inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
I. Selling, Informational and Administ
rative ExpensesSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense.
Advertising expenses totaled approximately 
$3.1 billion in 2015 , $3.1 billion in 2014 and $3.0 billion in 2013 . Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of radio time, television time and space in publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.
J. Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection
with certain licensing arrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments made by us to third parties under licensing
arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a
compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.
R&D expenses related to upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights totaled 
$429 million in 2015 , $1.4 billion in 2014 and $203 million in 2013 . For additional information, see 
Note 2B and Note 2C . K. Amortization of Intangible 
Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation —These assets are recorded at cost and are increased by the cost of any  significant improvements afterpurchase. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on
 a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization —These acquired assets are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives that are associated with marketed products are not amortized until a useful life can be
determined. Intangible assets associated with IPR&D projects are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the 
EU, or in aseries of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. The useful life of an amortizing asset generally is determined by identifying the
period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated.
•
Goodwill —Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds
and intellectual property is included in 
Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to intangible assets that are associated with a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses 
and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairmentindicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset
, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount tothe carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess o
f book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of animpairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any,for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an
 impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterizethe asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that value to its book value. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, wethen determine the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the fair value of all the identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of 
the reporting unit andrecord an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value.
Impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about
the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. 2015 Financial Report

    L. Restructuring Charges and 
Certain Acquisition-Related CostsWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. (If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an
 asset, that incremental impact isclassified in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate). Termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs incurred in connection with a business
acquisition are expensed as incurred 
. Amounts recorded for restructuring charges and other associated costs can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 and uncertainties and can relyheavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. M. Cash Equivalents and Statement of 
Cash FlowsCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
Ifitems meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the
classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the na
ture of thehedge instrument. Cash flows associated with financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to 
their purpose and accountingnature.
N. Investments and Derivative Financial Inst
rumentsOur investments are comprised of the following: trading securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities (when we have both the positive intent and ability to
hold the investment to maturity) and private equity investments. The classification of an investment can depend
 on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to holdthe investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence.
•
Trading securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. •
Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities are carried at equity-method or cost. For equity investments where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of theinvestee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the equity method, we record our share of
 the investee’s income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions—net . The excess of the cost of the
 investment over our share of the equity of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets of the investee, withany remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which typically does not include amounts of contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity securities, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined to be other-
than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E ). A single estimate of fair value and impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. O. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Current tax assets primarily includes (i) tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group, which are recognized in the consolidated
statement of income when the asset transferred is sold to a third-party or recovered through amortization of the asse
t's remaining economic life; and (ii) income tax receivablesthat are expected to be recovered either as refunds from taxing authorities or as a reduction to
 future tax obligations.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilitiesusing enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an
 assessment of estimatedfuture taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to
 realize the deferred tax assets. Alldeferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.
We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely onthe technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit
 by determining the76
 
 2015 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    amount that is greater than 
50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has  full knowledgeof all relevant information.
Under the benefit recognition model, if our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the
tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of 
theposition to more-likely-than-not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with 
theappropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and
 foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations,changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not standard. Liabilities
associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months
. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded inProvision for taxes on income 
and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances and income tax contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. P. Pension and P
ostretirement Benefit PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees.
We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined bene
fit plans as an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The obligations aregenerally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and
other postretirement obligations may include assumptions such as expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include
assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the
 expected cost of providing medicalinsurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the
 employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fairvalue. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized, as required, into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses 
, as appropriate. Amounts recorded for pension and postretirement benefit plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Q. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. We record accruals for
these contingencies to the extent that we conclude tha
t a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimatethan any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no
 amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount,we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
Amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
 assumptions.For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. R. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses 
, as appropriate. Amounts recorded for share-based compensation can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see

A. Acquisitions
Hospira, Inc. (Hospira)
On September 3, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars,
for 
$90 per share in cash. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Hospira was approximately $16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local
legal and regulatory steps.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Hospira’s principal business was the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of generic 
acute-care and oncology injectables, biosimilars and integrated infusion therapy and medication management systems. Hospira’s broad portfolio of products is used by hospitals and alternate site providers, such as clinics, home healthcare
providers and long-term care facilities. We believe our 
acquisition of Hospira has strengthened our GEP business, as GEP now has a  broadened portfolio of generic andbranded sterile injectables, marketed biosimilars, medication management systems and biosimilars in development.
The following table summarizes the provisional amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The estimated values are not yet
finalized (see below) and are subject to change, which could be significant. We will finalize the amounts recognized as we obtain the information necessary to complete the
analyses. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later 
than one year from the acquisition date.(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)

As of the acquisition date, included in Current tax assets ( $79 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $25 million ), Income taxes payable ( $5 million ), Noncurrent deferred taxliabilities 
( $3.4 billion ) and Other taxes payable ( $114 million , including accrued interest of $5 million ). The following items are subject to change:
•
Amounts for certain balances included in working capital (excluding inventories), certain investments and certain legal contingencies, pending receipt of certain information that could affect provisional amounts recorded. We do not believe any adjustments for legal contingencies will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
•
Amounts for intangibles, inventory and property, plant and equipment, pending finalization of valuation efforts for acquired intangible assets as  well as the completion ofcertain physical inventory counts and the confirmation of the physical existence and condition of certain property, plant and equipment asse
ts.•
Amounts for income tax assets, receivables and liabilities, pending the filing of Hospira pre-acquisition tax returns and the receipt of information including but not limited to that from taxing authorities, which may change certain estimates and assumptions used.
As of the acquisition date, the fair value of accounts
 receivable approximated the book value acquired. The gross contractual amount receivable was $570 million , of which $7 million 
was not expected to be collected. In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for environmental, legal and tax matters, as well as guarantees and indemnifications. These matters may include
contingencies. Except as specifically excluded by the relevant accounting standard, contingencies are required to be measured at fair value as of
 the acquisition date if theacquisition-date fair value of the asset or liability arising from a contingency can be determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of the asset
 or liability cannot be determined,the asset or liability would be recognized at the acquisition date if both of the following criteria are met: (i) it is probable that an asset
 existed or that a liability had been incurredat the acquisition date, and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.
•
Environmental Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for environmental matters such as remediation work, asset retirement obligations and environmental guarantees and indemnifications.
•
Legal Matters —Hospira is involved in various legal proceedings, including product liability, patent, commercial, antitrust and environmental matters and government investigations, of a nature considered normal to its business. The contingencies arising from legal matters are not significant to Pfizer’s financial statements.
•
Tax Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for income taxes . Income taxes are exceptions to both the recognition and fair valuemeasurement principles associated with the accounting for business combinations. Reserves for income tax contingencies continue to be measured under the benefit
recognition model as previously used by Hospira (see 
Note 1O ). Net liabilities for income taxes approximated $3.4 billion as of the acquisition date, which includes $112 million 
for uncertain tax positions. The net tax liability includes the recording of additional adjustments of approximately $3.3 billion for the tax impact of fair value adjustments and approximately 
$744 million for income tax matters that we intend to resolve in a manner different from what Hospira had planned or intended. For 78

    example, because we plan to repatriate certain overseas funds, we provided deferred taxes on Hospira’s unremitted earnings for which no taxes have been previously
provided by Hospira as it was Hospira’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings.
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the 
future economic benefits arising from other assetsacquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Hospira includes the following:
•
the expected specific synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of Hospira with the operations of Pfizer;•
any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, as well as future, as yet unidentified projects and products; and•
the value of the going-concern element of Hospira’s existing businesses (the higher rate of return on the assembled collection of net assets versus if Pfizer had acquired allof the net assets separately).
Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill related to the acquisition of Hospira is related to our G
EP segment (see Note 10 for additional information).
Actual and Pro Forma Impact of Acquisition 
—The following table presents information for Hospira’s operations that are included in Pfizer’s consolidated statements of income beginning from the acquisition date, September 3, 2015 through Pfizer’s domestic and international year-ends in 2015 (see

  1.22  1.28 The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results do not purport to reflect what the combined company’s results of operations would have been had the
 acquisitionoccurred on January 1, 2014, nor do they project the future results of operations o
f the combined company or reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associatedwith the acquisition. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected here due
 to many factors. Theunaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes various assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed from Hospira.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results reflect the historical financial information of Pfizer and Hospira, adjusted to give effect to the
 acquisition of Hospiraas if it had occurred on January 1, 2014, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments:
•
Elimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense (approximately $33 million in 2015 and $77 million in 2014). •
Additional amortization expense (approximately $343 million in 2015 and $496 million in 2014) related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired.
•
Additional depreciation expense (approximately $54 million in 2015 and $104 million in 2014) related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment (PP&E) acquired.
•
Adjustment related to the preliminary estimate of the non-recurring fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold (the elimination of $340 million 
of charges in 2015 and the addition of $576 million of charges in 2014). •
Adjustment to decrease interest expense (approximately $18 million in 2015 and $42 million in 2014) related to the fair value adjustment of Hospira debt. •
Adjustment for non-recurring acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition (the elimination of $877 million of charges in 2015, and the addition of $877 million 
of charges in 2014, reflecting non-recurring charges incurred by both Hospira and Pfizer). 2015 Financial Report

    The above adjustments were then adjusted for the applicable tax impact. The taxes associated with 
the adjustments related to the preliminary estimate of the fair valueadjustment for acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and inventory reflect the statutory 
tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the adjustments areexpected to be incurred. The taxes associated with the adjustments for the
 elimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense, the fair value adjustmentfor the acquired debt and the non-recurring acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition were based on the tax rate in the jurisdiction in which the related
deductible costs were incurred.
Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc. (Baxter)
On December 1, 2014 (which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter 
’ s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchaseprice of 
$648 million . The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis. In connection with this acquisition, we
recorded 
$376 million in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization primarily consisting of $371 million in Developed technology rights. We also recorded $194 million 
of Inventories and $12 million in Goodwill . The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
InnoPharma, Inc. (InnoPharma)
On September 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of InnoPharma, a privately-held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment o
f $225 million and contingent consideration with an estimated acquisition-date fair value of approximately 
$67 million . The contingent consideration consists of up to $135 million in additional milestone payments based on application filing with, and acceptance by, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or approval of marketing applications related
to certain pipeline products by the FDA. We believe this acquisition represents a potential innovative growth opportunity for our sterile injectables portfolio in areas such as
oncology and central nervous disorders. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded 
$247 million in Identifiable intangible assets , less accumulated amortizationconsisting of 
$212 million in IPR&D and $35 million in Developed technology rights ; $81 million in net deferred tax liabilities; and $125 million in Goodwill . The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
B. Licensing Agreements
Cellectis SA (Cellectis)
In June 2014, we entered into a global arrangement with Cellectis to develop Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select
cellular surface antigen targets. In August 2014, in connection with this licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment
 of $80 million to Cellectis, which was recorded in Research and development expenses 
. We will also fund research and development costs associated with 15 Pfizer-selected targets and, for the benefit of Cellectis, a portionof the research and development costs associated with 
four Cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. Cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory andcommercial milestone payments of up to 
$185 million per product that results from the Pfizer-selected targets. Cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by Pfizer. In addition, in August 2014, we acquired approximately 
10% of the capital of Cellectis through the purchase of newly issued shares, for a total investment of approximately 
$35 million . As of November 30, 2015, Pfizer’s ownership in Cellectis had been reduced to approximately 7.94% of Cellectis’ outstanding shares due to subsequent share issuances by Cellectis, including the initial public offering of Cellectis American Depository Shares.
Nexium Over-the-Counter Rights
In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca PLC (As
traZeneca) for the exclusive, global, over-the-counter (OTC) rights for Nexium, a leading prescriptiondrug approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In connection with this Consumer Healthcare licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment of
$250 million 
to AstraZeneca, which was recorded in Research and development expenses when incurred. On May 27, 2014, we launched Nexium 24HR in the U.S., and on July 11, 2014, we paid AstraZeneca a related 
$200 million product launch milestone payment. On August 1, 2014, we launched Nexium Control in Europe, and on Sep tember15, 2014, we paid AstraZeneca a related 
$50 million product launch milestone payment. These post-approval milestone payments were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization 
and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the Nexium brand. Included in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2015 are accrued milestone payments to AstraZeneca of 
$93 million . AstraZeneca is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of approximately $200 million , based on the level of worldwide sales as well as quarterly royalty payments based on worldwide sales.
C. Collaborative Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of
research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or
commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the ac
tivity. Our rights andobligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and
we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.

ation with OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO), see below), $1.2 billion in 2014 (related to our collaboratio n with Merck KGaA, see below), and $67 million in 2013 . (f) 
 In 2015, 2014 and 2013, includes royalties earned on sales of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada after October 31, 2013. On that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. andCanada expired, and we 
became entitled to royalties for a 36 -month period thereafter.The amounts disclosed in the above table do not include transactions with third parties other than our collaboration partners, or other costs associated
 with the products underthe collaborative arrangements.
In addition, in connection with our collaborative arrangements, we paid post-approval milestones to collaboration partners of 
$20 million in 2015 , $80 million in 2014 and $175million 
in 2013 . These payments were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets –– Developed technology rights. We also received upfront and milestone payments from our collaboration partners of 
$200 million in 2015 primarily related to our collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company (Lilly) (see below) and $128 million in 2013 . These amounts were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue and are being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period. Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company (Lilly)
In October 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer’s tanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will
equally share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following the decision by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the
partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a 
$200 million upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab in July 2015, which will consist of 
six studies inapproximately 
7,000 patients across osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. Under the collaboration agreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.
Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO)
In December 2014, we entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long-acting human growth hormone (hGH-CTP) for the
treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age (SGA) who fail to
show catch-up growth by two years of age. hGH-CTP has the potential to reduce 
the required dosing frequency of human growth hormone to a single weekly injection from thecurrent standard of one injection per day. We have received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. OPKO will lead the clinical activities and will be
responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which include Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. We will be responsible for all
development costs for additional indications, all postmarketing studies, manufacturing and commercialization activities for all indications, and we will lead the manufacturing
activities related to product development. The transaction closed on January 28, 2015, upon termination of 
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino AntitrustImprovements Act. In February 2015, we made an upfront payment of 
$295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional 
$275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval,
the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and our product, Genotropin.

    Collaboration with Merck KGaA
In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary
name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently in development as a potential treatment for multiple types of cancer. We and Merck KGa
A areexploring the therapeutic potential of this novel anti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with our and Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of
approved and investigational oncology therapies. The collaboration with Merck KGaA has initiated 
28 programs, monotherapy and combination trials, including seven pivotal trials in Phase IB/2 or Phase 3 (two in lung cancer, two in gastric cancer, and one in each
 of bladder cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer) and received FDAbreakthrough therapy designation for avelumab in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. We and Merck KGaA are also combining resources and expertise to advance our anti-PD-
1 antibody into Phase 1 trials. Under the terms of the agreement, in the
 fourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfront payment of $850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . Both companies will jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 products from this collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we gave
 Merck KGaAcertain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S. and several other key markets, and co-promotion activities were initiated in key select markets in 2015. In 2014, we recorded
$1.2 billion 
of Research and development expenses associated with this collaborative arrangement, composed of the $850 million upfront cash payment as well as an additional amount of 
$309 million , reflecting the estimated fair value of the co-promotion rights given to Merck KGaA. D. Divestitures
Animal Health Business—Zoetis Inc.
On June 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our Animal Health business. The full disposition was completed through a series of s
teps, including, in the first quarter of2013, the formation of Zoetis and an initial public offering (IPO) of an approximate 
19.8% interest in Zoetis and, in the second quarter of 2013, an exchange o ffer for theremaining 
80.2% interest. With respect to the formation and disposition of Zoetis, in 2013:
•
Formation of Zoetis —On January 28, 2013, our then wholly owned subsidiary, Zoetis, issued $3.65 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Also, on January 28, 2013, we transferred to Zoetis substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our Animal Health business in exchange for all of the Class A
 and Class B common stock ofZoetis, 
$1.0 billion of the $3.65 billion of Zoetis senior notes and an amount of cash equal to substan tially all of the cash proceeds received by Zoetis from the remaining$2.65 billion 
of senior notes issued. The $1.0 billion of Zoetis senior notes received by Pfizer were exchanged by Pfizer for the retirement of Pfizer commercial paper issued in 2012, and the cash proceeds received by Pfizer of approximately 
$2.6 billion were used for dividends and stock buybacks. •
Initial Public Offering ( 19.8% Interest) —On February 6, 2013, an IPO of the  Class A common stock of Zoetis was completed, pursuant to which we sold 99.015 million shares of Class A common stock of Zoetis (all of the Class A common stock, including shares sold pursuant to 
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, whichwas exercised in full) in exchange for the retirement of approximately 
$2.5 billion of Pfizer commercial paper issued in 2013. The Class A common stock sold in the IPO represented approximately 
19.8% of the total outstanding Zoetis shares. The excess of  the consideration received over the net book value of our divested interest wasapproximately 
$2.3 billion and was recorded in Additional paid-in capital. •
Exchange Offer ( 80.2% Interest) —On June 24, 2013, we exchanged all of our remaining interest in Zoetis, 400.985 million shares of Zoetis Class A common stock (after converting all of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock, representing approximately 
80.2% of the total outstanding Zoetis shares), for approximately 405.117 million 
outstanding shares of Pfizer common stock on a tax-free basis pursuant to an exchange  offer made to Pfizer shareholders. The $11.4 billion of Pfizer common stock received in the exchange transaction was recorded in 
Treasury stock and was valued using the opening price of Pfizer common stock on June 24, 2013, the date we accepted the Zoetis shares for exchange. The gain on the
 sale of the remaining interest in Zoetis was approximately $10.3 billion , net of income taxes resulting from certain legal entity reorganizations, and was recorded in 
Gain on disposal of discontinued operations––net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
In summary, as a result of the above transactions, we received cash and were relieved of debt obligations in the aggregate
 amount of approximately $6.1 billion and received shares of Pfizer common stock (held in 
Treasury stock ) valued at approximately $11.4 billion . The operating results of the animal health business through June 24, 2013, the date
 of disposal, are reported as Income from discontinued operations––net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
In connection with the above transactions, we entered into a transitional services agreement (TSA) and manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs) with Zoetis 
that aredesigned to facilitate the orderly transfer of business operations to the standalone Zoetis entity
. The TSA relates primarily to administrative services, which are generally to beprovided within 
24 months. Services under the TSA are largely completed as of December 31, 2015. Under the MSAs, we will manufacture and supply certain animal healthproducts to Zoetis for a period of up to 
five years, with an ability to extend, if necessary, upon mutual agreement of both parties. These agreements are not material and noneconfers upon us the ability to influence the operating and/or financial policies of Zoetis subsequent to June
 24, 2013, the date of disposal.82

E. Equity-Method Investments
Investment in Hisun Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Company Limited (Hisun Pfizer)
On September 6, 2012, we and Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., a leading pharmaceutical company in China, formed a new company, Hisun Pfizer, to
 develop,manufacture, market and sell pharmaceutical products, primarily branded generic products, predominately in China. Hisun Pfizer was established with registered capital of
$250 million 
, of which our portion was $122.5 million . On January 1, 2013, both parties transferred selected employees to Hisun Pfizer and con tributed, among other things,certain rights to commercialized products and products in development, intellectual property rights, and facilities, equipment and distribution/customer contracts. Our
contributions in 2013 constituted a business, as defined by U.S. G
AAP, and included, among other things, the China rights to certain commercialized products and otherproducts not yet commercialized and all associated intellectual property rights. As a result of the contributions from both parties, Hisun Pfizer holds a broad portfolio of
 brandedgenerics covering cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, oncology, mental health and other therapeutic areas. We hold a 
49% equity interest in Hisun Pfizer. We also entered into certain transition agreements designed to ensure and facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to
 Hisun Pfizer, primarily the Pfizer ProductsTransition Period Agreement and a related supply and promotional services agreement. These agreements provide for a profit margin on the manufacturing services provided
by Pfizer to Hisun Pfizer and govern the supply, promotion and distribution of Pfizer products until Hisun Pfizer is able to provide for its
 own manufacturing and distribution.While intended to be transitional, these agreements may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties 
for several years and, possibly, indefinitely. These agreements arenot material to Pfizer, and none confers upon us any additional ability to influence the operating and/or 
financial policies of Hisun Pfizer.In connection with our contributions in the first quarter of 2013, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately 
$459 million in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ) ,reflecting the transfer of the business to Hisun Pfizer (including an allocation of goodwill from our former Emerging Markets reporting unit as part of the carrying amount of the
business transferred). Since we hold a 
49% interest in Hisun Pfizer, we had an indirect retained interest in the contributed assets. As such, 49% of the gain, or $225 million , represents the portion of the gain associated with that indirect retained interest.
In the third quarter of 2015, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decline in the value of Hisun P
fizer, and, therefore, in 2015, we recognized a loss of $463 million 
in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ) .The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun P
fizer, as a result of lower than expected recent performance,increased competition, a slowdown in the China economy in relation to their products, as well as certain changes in the regulatory environment.
In valuing our investment in Hisun Pfizer, we used discounted cash flow techniques, utilizing a 
12% discount rate in 2015 and a 11.5% discount rate in 2013, reflecting our best estimate of the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows, and a nominal terminal year growth factor. Some of the more significant estimates and
 assumptions inherentin this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected
 impact of competitive, legal, economic and/or regulatory forces onthe products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long-term; and 
the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risksinherent in the projected cash flows, including country risk.
We are accounting for our interest in Hisun Pfizer as an equity-method investment, due to the significant influence we have
 over the operations of Hisun Pfizer through ourboard representation, minority veto rights and 
49% voting interest. Our investment in Hisun Pfizer is reported in Long-term investments , and our share of Hisun Pfizer’s net income is recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net. As of 2015 Financial Report    
 
 83
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer was approximately 
$775 million and the amount of our underlying equity in the net assets of Hisun Pfizer was approximately 
$668 million . As of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer was approximately $ 1.4 billion , and the amount of our underlying equity in the net assets of Hisun Pfizer was approximately 
$780 million . The excess of the carrying value of our investment over our underlying equity in the net assets of Hisun Pfizer has been allocated, within the investment account, to
 goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount allocated to other intangible assets is beingamortized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over an average estimated useful life of 25 years.Investment in ViiV Healthcare Limited (ViiV)
Our minority ownership interest in ViiV, a company formed in 2009 by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline plc to focus solely on research, development and commercialization of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines, was impacted by the following events:
•
The January 21, 2014 European Commission approval of Tivicay (dolutegravir), a product for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, developed by ViiV. This approval triggered areduction in our equity interest in ViiV from 
12.6% to 11.7% , effective April 1, 2014. As a result, in 2014,  we recognized a loss of approximately $30 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
; •
The August 12, 2013 FDA approval of Tivicay (dolutegravir). This approval triggered a reduction in our interest in ViiV from 13.5% to 12.6% effective October 1, 2013. As a result, in 2013, we recognized a loss of approximately 
$32 million in Other (income)/ deductions –– net ; and•
The October 31, 2012 acquisition by ViiV of the remaining 50% of Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC, its equity-method investee, from Shionogi & Co., Ltd. in consideration for a 10% 
interest in ViiV (newly issued shares) and contingent consideration in the form of future royalties. As a result of this transaction, ViiV recorded a gain associated withthe step-up on the 
50% interest previously held by ViiV. Also, our equity interest in ViiV was reduced from 15.0% to 13.5% . We account for our investment in ViiV under the equity method due to 
the significant influence that we continue to have through our board representation and minority vetorights.
Investment in Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro S.A. (Teuto)
We have an option to acquire the remaining 
60% of Teuto, a 40% -owned generics company in Brazil, and Teuto’s shareholders have an option to sell their 60% stake in the company to us. Under the terms of our agreement with Teuto’s other shareholders, 2016 is the final year in which the call and put
 options may be exercised. Our investment inTeuto is accounted for under the equity method due to the
 significant influence we have over the operations of Teuto through our board representation, minority veto rights and40% 
voting interest. •
In 2014, we recorded income of approximately $55 million in Other (income)/deductions––net, resulting from a decline in the estimated loss from the net call/put option recorded in 2013 and an impairment loss of 
$56 million in Other (income)/deductions––net related to our equity method investment. •
In 2013, we recorded a loss of $223 million in Other (income)/deductions –– net related to the net call/put option and an impairment loss of $32 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
related to our equity-method investment. F. Cost-Method Investment
AM-Pharma B.V. (AM-Pharma)
In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recombinant human
Alkaline Phosphatase (recAP) for inflammatory diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company. The option becomes exercisable
upon delivery of the clinical trial report after completion of a Phase II trial of recAP in the 
treatment of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis. Results from the current Phase IItrial for recAP are expected in 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid 
$87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in 
Long-term investments , and we may make additional payments of up to $512.5 million upon exercise of the option and potential launch of any product that may result from this investment.
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity
Initiatives
We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. For
example:
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may includeexpenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees,
assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions,workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
All of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, as well as groups such as
information technology, shared services and corporate operations.
In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. For up
 to a three -year period post-acquisition, we expect to incur costs of approximately 
$1 billion (not including costs of $215 million in 2015 associated with the return of acquired in-process research and development rights as described in the 
Current-Period Key Activities section below) associated with the integration of Hospira. 84
 
 2015 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    In early 
2014 , we announced that we would be incurring costs in 2014 - 2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost- reduction/productivity initiatives. We have the following initiatives underway associated with these programs:
•
Manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization, where execution timelines are necessarily long. Our plant network strategy is expected to result in the exit offour 
sites over the next several years. In connection with these activities, during 2014 - 2016 , we expect to incur costs of approximately $500 million associated with prior acquisition activity and costs of approximately 
$1 billion associated with new non-acquisition-related cost-reduction initiatives. Through December 31, 2015 , we incurred approximately 
$354 million and $472 million , respectively, associated with these initiatives. •
New global commercial structure reorganization, which primarily includes the streamlining of certain functions, the realignment of regional locations and colleagues tosupport the businesses, as well as implementing the necessary system changes to support future reporting
requirements. In connection with this reorganization, during 
2014 - 2016 , we expect to incur costs of approximately $250 million . Through December 31, 2015 , we incurred approximately 
$219 million associated with this reorganization. •
Other new cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, primarily related to commercial property rationalization and consolidation. In connection with these cost-reduction activities,during 
2014 - 2016 , we expect to incur costs of approximately $850 million . Through December 31, 2015 , we incurred approximately $493 million associated with these initiatives.
The costs expected to be incurred during 2014-2016, of approximately 
$2.6 billion in total for the above-mentioned programs (but not including expected costs associated with the Hospira integration), include restructuring charges, integration costs, implementation costs and additional depreciation––asset restructuring. Of this amount, we expect that
about a quarter of the charges will be non-cash.
At the end of 2013, we had substantially completed many of 
the initiatives launched in prior periods.Current-Period Key Activities
In 
2015 , we incurred approximately $1.4 billion in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) in connection with the acquisition of Hospira and the aforementioned programs, primarily associated with our manufacturing and sales operations.

In 2015 , Employee terminations represent the expected reduc tion of the workforce by approximately 3,900 employees, mainly in sales, corpor ate and research. Employee termination costs are generally recordedwhen the actions are probable
 and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.The restructuring charges in 
2015 , which include a $39 million charge related to a 36% reduction in our labor force i n Venezuela, are associated with the following:•
Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment (GIP) ( $39 million ); the Global Vaccines, Oncology and C onsumer Healthcare segment (VOC) ( $45 million ); the Global Established Phar maceutical segment(GEP) (

2014 are associated with the  following:•
GIP ( $35 million ); VOC ( $28 million ); GEP ( $57 million ); WRD/M ( $37 million ); manufacturing operations ( $97 million ); and Corporate ( $65 million ), as well as $149 million of income related to the partial reversal of prior-period r
estructuring charges not directly associated with the new individual segments, and primarily reflecting a change in estimate with respect to our sales force restructuring plans.The restructuring charges in 
2013 are associated with the  following:•
Total operating segments ( $496 million ); WRD/M ( $13 million ); manufacturing operations ( $356 million ); and Corporate ( $173 million ). At the beginning of fiscal 
2014 , we revised our operating se gments and are unable to directly associate these prior-period restructuring charges with the new individual segments.In September 2015, in ord
er to eliminate certain redundancies in our biosimilar drug products pipeline created as a result of the acquisition of Hospira, we opted to return rights to Celltrion Inc. and CelltrionHealthcare, Co., Ltd. (collectively, Celltrio
n) that Hospira had previously acquired to potential biosimilars to Rituxan® (rituximab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab). As such, upon return of the acquired rights, in 2015we incurred charges of 
$215 million , which are comprised of (i) a write-off of t he applicable IPR&D assets, totaling $170 million , which is included in Asset impairments; (ii) a write-off of amounts prepaid to Celltrion in the amount of 
$25 million , which is included in Asset impairments; and (iii) a payment to Celltrion of $20 million , which is included in Exit costs . The recorded amounts for the assets acquired fromHospira are provisional and

2015 v. 2014 ––Interest income increased primarily due to higher investme nt returns. Interest expense decreased , primarily due to the repayment of a portion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015 and the benefit of the effective conversi
on of some fixed-rate liabilities to floating-rate liabilities. 2014 v. 2013 ––Interest income increased due to higher cash equivalent s and investment balances. Interest expensedecreased 
, primarily due to the benefit of t he effective conversion of some fixed-rate liabilities to floating-rate liabilities. Capitalized interest expense totaled $ 32 million in 2015 , $ 41 million in 2014 and $ 32 million 
in 2013 . (b)

ed at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30, but rather at the SIMADI rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtain significantconversions of Venezuelan bo
livars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, a n evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth-quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a36% 
reduction in our labor fo rce in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy.(c)

Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2015 . Fair value was determined using t he income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flowmethod. We started with a forecast of 
all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significantestimates and assumptions inh
erent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the productand the impact of technolo
gical risk associated with IPR&D assets; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate thegeographic diversity of the pr
ojected cash flows.Note 5. Tax Matters

2015 v. 2014 –– The increase in the domestic loss was primarily due to the loss of exclusivity for Celebrex and Zyvox, higher restructuring charges and higher selling, informational and administrative expenses,partially offset by the performanc
e of certain products including Prevnar 13 and Ibrance, and the impact of Hospira operations. The decrease in international income is primarily due to a foreign currency lossrelated to Venezuela, hig
her asset impairments, and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in certain developed markets, partially offset by lower research and development costs.(b)
 
2014 v. 2013 –– The increase in the domestic loss was primarily due to lower revenues, the non-recurrence of income from a litigation settlement in 2013 with Teva and Sun for patent-infringement damagesresulting from their “at-risk” launches 
of generic Protonix in the U.S., higher charges related to other legal matters, a non-tax deductible charge in the third quarter of 2014 to account for an additional year of theBranded Prescription Drug Fee in 
accordance with final regulations issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), higher research and development expenses, and higher charges for business and legal entityalignment costs, partially offset by low
er amortization of intangible assets, lower restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, and lower assetimpairments. The decrease in inter
national income is primarily related to lower revenues, the non-recurrence of the gain associated with the transfer of certain product rights to Pfizer’s equity-method investment inChina (Hisun Pfizer) in 2013, an

    B. Tax Rate Reconciliation
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our ef
fective tax rate for Income from continuing operations  follows:  
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2015  2014  2013 U.S. statutory income tax rate
  35.0  % 35.0  % 35.0  %Taxation of non-U.S. operations 
(a), (b), (c)  (9.6 ) (7.4 ) (2.5 )Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions 
(d)  (4.0 ) (2.9 ) (5.7 )U.S. Healthcare Legislation

(e)  (2.1 ) 0.5  1.0 Effective tax rate for income from continuing operations
  22.2  % 25.5  % 27.4  %(a)
 
For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the cost of repatriation decisions, aswell as changes in uncertain t
ax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions”. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significantcomponent of our effective tax r
ate each year as tax rates outside the U.S. are generally lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location ofnon-U.S. earnings and the l
evel of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the cost of repatriation decisions, and other U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations, is a significant component of oureffective tax rate each year an
d generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; and (iii) the impact of changes in uncertain taxpositions not included in th
e reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions” is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to oureffective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of 
earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as repatriation costs, can vary as a result of the repatriation decisions, as a result of operatingfluctuations in the normal cours
e of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategicbusiness decisions. See also 
Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income and Provision for taxes on income, which is based on the lo cation of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements andother items impacting 
Provision for taxes on income . (b)
 
In all periods presented, the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings is largely due to generally lower tax rates, as well as manufacturing and other incentivesassociated with our subsidiaries i
n Puerto Rico, Singapore, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. We benefit from a Puerto Rican incentive grant that expires in 2029. Under the grant, we are partially exemptfrom income, property and munici
pal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2031 on income from manufacturing and other operations. Hospira’s infusion technologies businessbenefits from income tax exemptio
ns in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic through 2028 and 2019, respectively.(c)
 
The rate impact in 2015 also includes the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela. The favorable rate impact in 2014 also includes the decline in the non-tax deductible loss recorded in2013 related to an opti
on to acquire the remaining interest in Teuto, since we expect to retain the investment indefinitely. The rate impact in 2013 also includes the non-deductibility of the goodwill derecognizedand the jurisdictional mix of the 
other intangible assets divested as part of the transfer of certain product rights to Hisun Pfizer, and the non-deductibility of the loss on an option to acquire the remaining interest inTeuto, since we expect to retain th
e investment indefinitely, and the non-deductibility of an impairment charge related to our equity-method investment in Teuto. For additional information, see Note 2E. (d)
 
For a discussion about tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions, the impact of U.S. Healthcare Legislation, the U.S. R&D tax credit and the impact of certain legal settlements and charges, see Note 5A. 
The extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit in January 2013 resulted in the full-year benefit of the 2012 and 2013 U.S. R&D tax credit being recorded in 2013.(e) 
 All other, net in 2015 primarily relates to tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives in the normal course of business.90

    C. Deferred Taxes
On December 31, 2015, we adopted a new accounting standard that requires all deferred tax assets and
 liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. Weelected to apply this new standard retrospectively. The impact of the change in presentation is tha
t all deferred tax assets and liabilities that were previously reported in currentassets and current liabilities, totaling net current deferred tax assets of  
$2.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 have been reclassified to noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, as appropriate.
Deferred taxes arise as a result of basis differentials between financial statement accounting and tax amounts.
The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, shown before jurisdictional netting, follow:
 
  2015 Deferred Tax   2014 Deferred Tax (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  Assets   (Liabilities)   Assets   (Liabilities) Prepaid/deferred items

 (c)     $(26,145 )     $(22,402 ) (a)
 
The amounts in 2015 and 2014 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion , respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax creditcarryforwards that are available, 
under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.(b)
 
The increase in 2015 reflects additional accruals for certain funds earned outside the U.S. that will not be indefinitely reinvested overseas, virtually all of which were earned in the current year. For additionalinformation, see 
Note 5A. (c)
In 2015, Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $732 million ),and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $26.8 billion ). In 2014 , Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent taxassets 
( $915 million ), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $23.3 billion ). We have carryforwards, primarily related to foreign tax credits, net operating and capital losses and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal
and state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2016 to 2035. Certain of our U.S
. net operating losses aresubject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.
Valuation allowances are provided when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future 
taxable income thatincorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax asse
ts.As of 
December 31, 2015 , we have not made a U.S. tax provision on approximately $80.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of 
December 31, 2015 , is not practicable. D. Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax
positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and
 theresolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have
 beendeemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax bene
fits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variationfrom such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the sta
tutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discreteitems in the period of resolution.
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see 
Note 1O. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. 2015 Financial Report

    Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 
, we had approximately $4.8 billion and $4.7 billion , respectively, in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest. •
Tax assets associated with uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment ofincome taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to
 minimizedouble taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process and from foreign tax credits that
 would be generated upon settlement of an uncertain tax position.The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the ac
tual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases,the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had approximately $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively, in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. In 2015, these amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $963 million ) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( 
$179 million ). In 2014, these amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $966 million ) and 
Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $527 million ). •
Tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions represent unrecognized tax benefits, which arise when the estimated benefit recorded in our financial statementsdiffers from the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a
 tax return because of the uncertainties described above. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily toissues common among multinational corporations. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

( $196 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $2.4 billion ) and Other taxes payable ( $3.5 billion ). •
Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded in Provision for taxes on income in our consolidated statements of income. In 
2015 , we recorded net interest expense of $71 million . In 2014 , we recorded net interest expense of $40 million ; and in 2013 , we recorded net interest income of 
$16 million primarily as a result of settling certain tax positions with the U.S. and various foreign tax authorities. Gross accrued interest totaled 
$714 million as of December 31, 2015 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $5 million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $643 million 
as of December 31, 2014 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $18 million as a result of cash payments). In 2015 , these amounts were included in Current tax asset 
s ( $12 million ) and Other taxes payable ( $702 million ). In 2014 , these amounts were included in Current tax asset s ( $15 million ) and Other taxes payable ( $628million 
). Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS:
•
With respect to Pfizer Inc., the IRS has issued a Revenue Agent ’ s Report (RAR) for tax years 2009-2010. We are not in agreement with the RAR and are currentlyappealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2011-2013 are currently under audit. Tax years 2014 and 2015 are open, but not under audit
. All other tax years are closed.•
With respect to Hospira, Inc., the IRS is auditing 2010-2011 and 2012-2013. Tax years 2014-2015 (through date of acquisition) are open but not under audit. All other taxyears are closed. The open tax years and audits for Hospira, Inc. and its subsidiaries are not considered material to Pfizer.

 2015 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    In addition to the open audit years in the U.S.,
 we have open audit years in other major tax jurisdictions, such as Canada (2010-2015), Japan (2015), Europe (2007-2015,primarily reflecting Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Latin America (1998-2015, primarily reflecting Brazil) and Puerto Rico (2010-2015).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that withinthe next twelve months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by
 as much as $200 million , as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on
 estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but ourestimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not
 be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect ourfinancial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes o
f limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing auditswith the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of
 possible changesrelated to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.

We use a market approach in valuing financial instruments on a recurring basis. For additional information, see Note 1E. All of our financial assets and lia bilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis useLevel 2 inputs in the calculati
on of fair value, except less than 1% that use Level 1 inputs.(b)
 
As of December 31, 2015 , trading funds and secur ities are composed of $100 million of trading equity funds, $102 million of trading debt funds, and $85 million of trading equity securities. As of December 31, 2014 
, trading securities of $105 million is composed of debt and e quity securities. The trading equity securities as of December 31, 2015 and the trading debt and equity  securities as of December 31, 2014 are held in trust for benefits attribut
able to the former Pharmacia Savings Plus Plan.(c)
 
Generally, gross unrealized gains and losses are not significant. Unrealized losses related to 2015 available-for-sale debt securities are $593 million and unrealized gains are $44 million . The vast majority of investments in an unrealized l
oss position relate to the foreign exchange impact on foreign currency denominated securities, which are hedged with cross-currency swaps. We have the intent and ability to holdsuch investments to maturity.
(d)
 
Designated as hedging instruments, except for certain contracts used as offsets; namely, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts with fair values of $136 million as of December 31, 2015 ; and foreign currency forward-exchange co
ntracts with fair values of $159 million as of December 31, 2014 . (e)
 
Short-term borrowings include foreign currency short-term borrowings with fair values of $547 million as of December 31, 2015 , which are used as hedgin g instruments. The differences between the estimated fairvalues and carrying values of 
held-to-maturity debt securities, private equity securities at cost and short-term borrowings not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were not significant as of December 31, 2015 
or December 31, 2014 . The fair value measurements of o ur held-to-maturity debt securities and our short-term borrowings are based on Level 2 inputs, using a market approach. The fair valuemeasurements of our private e
quity securities carried at cost are based on Level 3 inputs.(f) 
 Our private equity securities represent investments in the life sciences sector.(g)
 
Designated as hedging instruments, except for certain contracts used as offsets; namely, foreign currency swaps with fair values of $234 million and foreign currency for ward-exchange contracts with fair values of$59 million 
as of December 31, 2015 ; and foreign currency swaps with f air values of $121 million and foreign currency for ward-exchange contracts with fair values of $54 million as of December 31, 2014 . (h) 
 Some carrying amounts may include adjustments for discount or premium amortization or for the effect of hedging the interest rate fair value risk associated with certain financial liabilities by interest rate swaps.(i) 
 Includes foreign currency debt with fair values of $560 million as of December 31, 2014 , which are used as hedging  instruments.(j) 
 The fair value of our long-term debt (not including the current portion of long-term debt) was $32.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $36.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 . The fair value mea surements for ourlong-term debt are based on Le
vel 2 inputs, using a market approach. Generally, the difference between the fair value of our long-term debt and the amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet is due to adecline in relative market interest r
ates since the debt issuance.A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For adescription of our general accounting policies associated with developing fair value estimates, see 
Note 1E. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Trading equity securities—quoted market prices.•
Trading debt securities—observable market interest rates.•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves. Loan-backed, receivable-backed, and mortgage-backed securities are valued by third-party models that use significant inputs derived from
observable market data like prepayment rates, default rates, and recovery rates.
•
Money market funds—observable Net Asset Value prices.•
Available-for-sale equity securities—third-party pricing services that principally use a composite of observable prices.•
Derivative financial instruments (assets and liabilities)—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Where applicable, these models discount future cash flow amounts using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices
for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Held-to-maturity debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves.
•
Private equity securities, excluding equity-method investments—application of the implied volatility associated with an observable biotech index to the carrying amount ofour portfolio.
•
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and ourown credit rating.
We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other
third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like LIBOR interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial
instruments.
The following table provides the classification of these selected financial assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets:

December 31, 2014 , include interest rate swaps ( $16 million ) and foreign currency swaps ( $581 million ). In addition, as of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had long-term receivables where the determination of fair value employs discounted future cash flows, using current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of these receivables were not significant.
There were no significant impairments of financial assets recognized in any period presented.

 Involving U.S. securities.(d)
 
Includes loan-backed, receivable-backed, and mortgage-backed securities, all of which are investment-grade and in senior positions in the capital structure of the security. Loan-backed securities are collateralizedby senior secured obligatio
ns of a diverse pool of companies or student loans, and receivable-backed securities are collateralized by credit cards receivables. Mortgage-backed securities are collateralized bydiversified pools of residential 
and commercial mortgages. These securities are valued by third party models that use significant inputs derived from observable market data like prepayment rates, default rates,and recovery rates.
C. Short-Term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings include amounts for commercial paper of 
$4.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $570 million as of December 31, 2014 . The weighted-average effective interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was 
1.9% as of December 31, 2015 and 2.5% as of December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 
2015 , we had access to $8.1 billion of lines of credit, of which $687 million expire within one year . Of these lines of credit, $7.9 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us 
$7.1 billion at our request. Also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2020, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. Under the terms of a substantial majority of our lines of credit agreements, upon the merger with Allergan, the lenders under the agreements
may elect to require immediate repayment of any amounts then outstanding and cancel the outstanding lines of credit.
 We expect to either amend the existing creditagreements or secure new credit agreements to replace these agreements.
D. Long-Term Debt
On September 3, 2015, the Hospira acquisition date, our long-term debt increased due to the addition o
f an aggregate principal amount of $1,750 million of legacy Hospira debt, recorded at acquisition-date fair value of 
$1,928 million . On May 15, 2014, we completed a public offering of 
$4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. 96

 At December 31, 2015, the debt issuances have been reclassified to Current portion of long- term debt . In October 2015, Pfizer exchanged 
$1.7 billion debt of its recently acquired subsidiary Hospira for virtually the same amount of Pfizer Inc. debt with the same interest rate  andmaturity terms as the Hospira debt, leaving a minor amount of outstanding debt in Hospira’s name. In connection with the exchange o
ffers, the indenture governing the Hospiranotes and the Hospira notes were amended to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants. The
 net income effect of this exchange wasimmaterial.

Hedging ActivitiesForeign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreignexchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to
same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt.
These financial instruments serve to protect net income and net investments against the impact of
 the translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominatedtransactions.
As of 
December 31, 2015 , the aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments hedging or offsetting foreign currency exposures was $35.7 billion 
. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, Japanese yen, and U.K. pound. The  maximum length of time over which we arehedging future foreign exchange cash flow relates to our 
$2.2 billion U.K. pound debt maturing in 2038. 2015 Financial Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in
fair value are reported in earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (offset or hedge  relationship) andthe effectiveness of the hedge relationships, as follows:
•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) the effective portion of the gains or losses on foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts, as appropriate, into earnings in the
 same period or periods during which the hedged transactionaffects earnings.
•
We recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps that are used to offset the same foreign currency assets orliabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essentially take the opposite currency position of that
reflected in the month-end balance sheet to counterbalance the effect o
f any currency movement.•
We recognize the gain and loss impact on foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward-exchange contracts designated as hedges of our net investments inearnings in three ways: over time—for the periodic net swap payments; immediately—to the extent of any change in the
 difference between the foreign exchange spot rateand forward rate; and upon sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments—to the extent
 of change in the foreign exchange spot rates.•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.
Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We strive to invest and borrow primarily on a floating-rate basis; however, in light of current
market conditions, we currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on market conditions, we will change the profile of our
outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. We entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge or offset
 the fixed interestrates on the hedged item, matching the amount and timing of the hedged
 item. As of December 31, 2015 , the aggregate notional amount of interest rate derivative financial instruments was 
$20.2 billion . The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar and euro fixed-rate debt. All derivative contracts used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair
value are reported in earnings, as follows:
•
We recognize the gains and losses on interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of thehedged risk. We recognize the offsetting earnings impact of fixed-rate debt attributable to 
the hedged risk also in earnings.Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.

slation adjustments.For information about the fair value of our derivative financial instruments, and the impact on our consolidated balance sheets, see 
Note 7A above . Certain of our derivativeinstruments are covered by associated credit-support agreements that have credit-risk-related contingent features designed to reduce our counterparties’ exposure to our risk
of defaulting on amounts owed. As of 
December 31, 2015 , the aggregate fair value of these derivative instruments that are in a net  liability position was $1.1 billion , for which we have posted collateral of 
$1.1 billion in the normal course of business. These features include the requirement to pay additional collateral in the event of a downgrade in our debt ratings. If there had been a downgrade to below an A rating by
 Standard and Poor’s (S&P) or the equivalent rating by Moody’s Investors Service, on December 31, 2015 , we would have been required to post an additional 
$20 million of collateral to our counterparties. The collateral advanced receivables are reported in Short-term investments. F. Credit Risk
On an ongoing basis, we review the creditworthiness of counterparties to our foreign exchange and interest rate agreements and do not
 expect to incur a significant loss fromfailure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments with any individual
counterparty. As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had $2.4 billion due from a well-diversified, highly rated group (S&P ratings of mostly A or better) of bank counterparties around the world. For details about our investments, see 
Note 7B above . In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. However, derivative financial instruments are executed under master netting agreements with financial
institutions and these agreements contain provisions that provide for the ability for collateral payments, depending on levels of exposure, our credit rating and the

    Our identifiable intangible assets are associated with the following, as a percentage of total identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization:

  —  81 % 19 % — Brands, indefinite-lived
  —  70 % 30 % — In-process research and development
  2 % 10 % 85 % 3 %Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the amortized cost associated with developed technology, which has been acquired from third parties and which can include the right to
develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that
 we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processesthat have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing the commercialized
products included in our biopharmaceutical businesses. The more significant components of developed technology rights are the following (in order of significance): Prevnar
13/Prevenar 13 Infant and Enbrel and, to a lesser extent
, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Pristiq, Tygacil, Refacto AF, Effexor and Benefix. Also included in thiscategory are infusion technologies and the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain biopharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protec
tion. Most of theseassets are associated with our Consumer Healthcare business unit. The more significant components of indefinite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Advil,
Xanax/Xanax XR, Centrum, Caltrate, Medrol and Preparation H. The more significant components of finite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Nexium,
Depo-Provera and, to a lesser extent, Advil Cold and Sinus and Idoform Bifiform.
In-Process Research and Dev
elopmentIPR&D assets represent research and development assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The more significant components of IPR&D arethe programs for the treatment of staph aureus infections, as well as the s
terile injectables and biosimilars IPR&D portfolios acquired as part of the Hospira acquisition and thesterile injectables IPR&D portfolio acquired as part of the InnoPharma acquisition.
IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated
 research and development effort.Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S.
or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. 
At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset,reclassify the asset out of in-process research and development and begin amortization. If the associated research and development ef
fort is abandoned, the related IPR&Dassets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.
For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty 
that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceuticalbusiness is high-risk and, as such, we expect that many of these IPR&D asse
ts will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future.Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets and the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 
11 years. Totalamortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was 
$3.8 billion in 2015 , $4.1 billion in 2014 and $4.8 billion in 2013. The following table provides the annual amortization expense expected for the years 2016 through 2020:

 GEP additions relate to our acquisition of Hospira and are subject to change until we complete the recording of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Hospira. For additional information, see Note 2A. Note 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both Internal Revenue Code-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the Internal Revenue
Code, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on
discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to
certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans. During 2015, we
recorded net pension and postretirement benefit obligations of approximately 
$115 million as a result of the acquisition of Hospira and an additional $122 million for the decision to terminate Hospira’s U.S. qualified pension plan.

2015 v. 2014 –– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. qualified pension plans was primarily driven by (i) higher settlement activity related to participants accepting the lump-sum option made in anoffer to certain plan participa
nts to elect a lump-sum payment to settle Pfizer’s pension obligation with those participants, or to elect an early annuity, and (ii) the increase in the amounts amortized for actuariallosses resulting from the decreas
e, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation (which increased the amount of deferred actuarial losses), and, to a lesser extent, a 2014 change inmortality assumptions (reflecting a lo
nger life expectancy for plan participants). The aforementioned increases were partially offset by (i) a greater expected return on plan assets resulting from an increased planasset base due to a volunta
ry contribution of $1.0 billion made at the beginning of January 2015, which in turn was partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets from 8.5% to 8.3% and (ii) lower interest costs resulting from the 
decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation.102

    2014 v. 2013 
–– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. qualified pension plans was primarily driven by (i) the decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from the increase, in2013, in the discount rate 
used to determine the benefit obligation (which reduced the amount of deferred actuarial losses), (ii) lower service cost resulting from cost-reduction initiatives, (iii) lower settlementactivity and (iv) greater expected r

2015 v. 2014 –– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was primarily driven by (i) an increase in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting fromthe decrease, in 2014, in t
he discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, and (ii) higher settlement activity.2014 v. 2013 
–– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was primarily driven by (i) the decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resultingfrom the increase, in 2013, in t

2015 v. 2014 –– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our international pension plans was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in the expected return on plan assets due to a lower expected rate of return onplan assets, (ii) an increase in th
e amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, and (iii) higher settlement charges dueto the settlement of a pensio
n plan in Sweden. The aforementioned increase in net periodic benefit costs was partially offset by the decrease in interest cost resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discountrate used to determine the
 benefit obligation.2014 v. 2013 
–– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our international pension plans was primarily driven by (i) greater expected return on plan assets resulting from an increased plan asset base, (ii) thedecrease in the amounts am
ortized for actuarial losses resulting from increases, in 2013, in the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations, partially offset by (iii) increased curtailment losses primarilydue to a loss relating to a U.K. p
ension plan freeze in the current year and (iv) changes in curtailments related to restructuring initiatives.(d)
 
2015 v. 2014 –– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our postretirement plans was primarily driven by (i) the increase in the amounts amortized for prior service credits and (ii) an increase in curtailmentgain resulting from the impleme
ntation of changes to certain retiree medical benefits to adopt programs eligible for the Medicare Part D plan subsidy, as allowed under the employer group waiver plan, and anotherplan change to establish 
benefit caps for certain plan participants, as well as (iii) a decrease in interest cost resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation. Theaforementioned decreas
es were partially offset by an increase in actuarial losses resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation.2014 v. 2013 
–– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our postretirement plans was primarily driven by the decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from the increase, in 2013, inthe discount rate used to d

  2.7 % 2.9 % 3.1 %The assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at fiscal year-end and to develop the
 net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, theassumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end o
f each previous fiscal year, while the assumptions used to determine benefitobligations are established at each fiscal year-end.
The net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on at
 least an annual basis. We revise these assumptions basedon an annual evaluation of long-term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost
 of providing retirement benefits.The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of aportfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates atwhich the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are se
t by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds ratedAA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a
 yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yieldcurves used to determine the discount rates at year-end 2015 exhibited higher interest rates as compared to the prior year.
The following table provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:

 In 2015 Pfizer started using separate healthcare cost trend rates for U.S. postretirement plan participants based on their age ( 6.5% for plan participants up  to the age of 65, and 7.9% for plan participants age 65 and over). The rate shown in th
e table is a blended rate, for ease of comparison.The following table provides the effects as of December 31, 2015 of a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the healthcare cost

The favorable change in the funded status of our U.S. qualified plans was primarily due to (i) the plan gains resulting from the increase in the discount rate, and (ii) a $1 billion voluntary contribution to the plans,partially offset by (i) the net impact of t
he acquisition of Hospira and (ii) a decrease in the actual return on assets.(b)
 
Our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) plans are generally not funded and these obligations, which are substantially greater than the annual cash outlay for these liabilities, will be paid from cash generated fromoperations. The decrease in t
he benefit obligation is primarily due to an increase in the discount rate.(c)
 
The favorable change in the international plans’ funded status was primarily due to (i) plan gains related to favorable changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, (ii) an increase in company contributions toplan assets and (iii)
 foreign exchange impacts.(d)
 
The favorable change in the funded status of our postretirement plans was primarily due to (i) plan gains resulting from favorable changes in plan assumptions and an increase in the discount rate, and (ii) theimpact of a plan amendment 
approved in June 2015 that introduced a cap on costs for certain groups within the plan, partially offset by (i) the reduced company contributions as the result of reimbursementsreceived for eligible prescriptio
n drug expenses for certain retirees and (ii) the acquisition of Hospira.(e)
 
For the U.S. and international pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO). For the postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation(ABO). The ABO for all of our U.S. qualified pe
nsion plans was $14.8 billion in 2015 and $16.3 billion in 2014 . The ABO for our  U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.4billion 
in 2014 . The ABO for our international pe nsion plans was $8.8 billion in 2015 and $10.3 billion in 2014 . 2015 Financial Report

The accumulated actuarial losses primarily represent the impact of changes in discount rates and other assumptions that result in cumulative changes in our projected benefit obligations, as well as the cumulativedifference between the expec
ted return and actual return on plan assets. These accumulated actuarial losses are recognized in Accumulated other comprehen sive loss and are amortized into net  periodic benefitcosts primarily over the average rem
aining service period for active participants, using the corridor approach. The average amortization periods utilized are 8.2 years for our U.S. qualified plans, 8.1 years for ourU.S. supplemental (non-qua
lified) plans, 17 years for our international plans, and 9.5 years for our postretirement plans. The following table provides information related to the funded status of selected benefit plans:

Note 1C. Specifically, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•
Cash and cash equivalents, Equity commingled funds, Fixed-income commingled funds––observable prices.•
Global equity securities—quoted market prices.•
Government and agency obligations, Corporate debt securities—observable market prices.•
Other investments—principally unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of fair value. These unobservable inputs could include, for example, the investmentmanagers’ assumptions about earnings multiples and future cash flows.

 2015 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to minimize net periodic benefit
costs and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return
expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account
 historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification,active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change
, we may adjust ourtargets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
Our long-term asset allocation ranges reflect our asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of 
the respective plans’ long-term benefitobligations. These ranges are supported by analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class, as well as volatilities and correlations across asset
classes and our liability profile.
The investment managers of certain commingled funds and private equity funds may be permitted to use derivative securities as described in each respective investment
management, subscription, partnership or other governing agreement.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws andlocal tax laws.
The following table provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:
  
  Pension Plans    (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  U.S. Qualified   U.S. Supplemental(Non-Qualified)
  International   Postretirement Plans Expected employer contributions:

  4,517  512  1,959  1,001 (a)
 
For the U.S. qualified plans, the $1.0 billion voluntary contribution was pai d in January 2016. For the U.S. postretirement plans, the Internal Revenue Code 401(h) reimbursement in January 2016 totaling $198 million 
is expected to exceed the  payments.The table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to
 be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used forthe calculation of the benefit obligation and, therefore, actual benefit payments
 may differ from projected benefit payments.F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and several other countries. For the majority of the
 U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of theirsalaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of 
the employee contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehiresand transfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, we no longer offer a
 defined benefit pension plan and, instead, offer a retirement savings contribution (RSC) in the defined contributionplan. Beginning on January 1, 2018, all non-union employees in those U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans will receive the RSC in the de
fined contribution plans. TheRSC enhanced benefit consists of a non-contributory employer contribution (that is, not dependent upon the
 participant making a contribution) determined based on eachemployee’s eligible compensation, age and years of service. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of 
$287 million in 2015 
, $278 million in 2014 and $266 million in 2013 . 2015 Financial Report

    Note 12. Equity
A. Common Stock
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in open market purchases as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of
the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our Board of Directors, are available for general corporate purposes. Our December 2011 
$10 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the first quarter of 2013. Our November 2012 
$10 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the fourth quarter of 2013. On June 27, 2013 , we announcedthat the Board of Directors had authorized a 
$10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2015. On October 23, 2014 , we announced that theBoard of Directors had authorized an additional 
$11 billion share-purchase plan (the October 2014 Stock Purchase Plan), and share repurchases commenced thereunder in January 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new 
$11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (G
S&Co.) to repurchase shares of our common stock. Thisagreement was entered into under our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11,
 2015, we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 
151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. On July 2, 2015, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. wascompleted, which, per the terms of the agreement, resulted in us owing GS&Co. a certain number of
 shares of Pfizer common stock or its equivalent dollar value. Pursuant tothe agreement’s settlement terms, we elected to settle this amount in cash and paid an
 additional $160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately$5.2 billion 
paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was $34.13 per share. The following table provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including
our accelerated share repurchase agreement:
(SHARES IN MILLIONS, DOLLARS IN BILLIONS)
  2015 (a) 2014  2013 Shares of common stock purchased
  182  165  563 Cost of purchase
  $6.2  $5.0  $16.3 (a) 
 Includes approximately 151 million shares purchased for $5.2 billion pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase  agreement as well as other share repurchases through year-end 2015.After giving effect to the accelerated share repurchase agreement, as well as other share repurchases through year-end 
2015 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately 
$16.4 billion at December 31, 2015 . In addition, on June 24, 2013, we exchanged all of our remaining interest in Zoetis for approximately 
405.117 million shares of our common stock, valued at $11.4 billion . The common stock received in the exchange transaction was recorded in 
Treasury stock . For additional information, see Note 2D. The definitive merger agreement we entered into with Allergan in November 2015 includes a provision that Pfizer may continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on
Pfizer’s common stock of not more than 
$0.28 per share per quarter (subject to annual adjustment, if any, in a manner consistent with past practice by P fizer’s Board ofDirectors), consistent with past practice as to timing of declaration, record date and payment date. On
 December 14, 2015, we declared a $0.30 dividend per share for the first quarter of 2016, which is in compliance with the definitive merger agreement.
B. Preferred Stock
The Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock is held by an employee stock ownership plan (Preferred ESOP) Trust and provides dividends at the rate of 
6.25% , which are accumulated and paid quarterly. The per-share stated value is 
$40,300 and the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock as to dividends and liquidation rights. Each share is convertible, at the holder’s option, into 
2,574.87 shares of our common stock with equal voting rights. The conversion option is indexed to our common stock and requires share settlement, and, therefore, is reported at the fair value at the da
te of issuance. We may redeem the preferred stock at any time or upon termination of thePreferred ESOP, at our option, in cash, in shares of
 common stock, or a combination of both at a price of $40,300 per share. C. Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We have 
two employee stock ownership plans (collectively, the ESOPs), the Preferred ESOP and another that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP).Allocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for the earnings per share (EPS) calculations and the even
tualconversion of allocated preferred shares held by the Preferred ESOP are assumed in the diluted EPS
 calculation. As of December 31, 2015 , the Preferred ESOP held preferred shares convertible into approximately 
2 million shares of our common stock, and the Common ESOP held approximately 58 million shares of our common stock. As of 
December 31, 2015 , all shares of preferred and common stock held by the ESOPs have been  allocated to the Pfizer U.S. and certain Puerto Rico defined contribution planparticipants. The compensation cost related to the common ESOPs was 
$8 million in 2015, $136 million in 2014 and $133 million in 2013. Prior to 2015, Pfizer matching contributions were primarily invested in the Common ESOP. Beginning in January 2015, Pfizer matching contributions are being invested based on the investment direction of
the employees’ own contributions. As a result, the compensation cost related to the Common ES
OP was lower in 2015, compared to 2014, while contributions made to otherinvestment funds increased. Therefore, although Pfizer matching contributions have not declined in aggregate, less contributions are being invested in the Common ES
OP.110

    Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments, in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), stock options, Portfolio Performance Shares (PP
Ss), TotalShareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs) and restricted stock grants.
The 2014 Stock Plan (2014 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2004 Stock Plan (2004 
Plan), as amended and restated. The 2014 Plan provides for 520 million shares to be authorized for grants, plus any shares remaining available for grant under the 2004 Plan as of April 24, 2014 (the carryforward shares). In addition, the 2014
 Plan provides thatthe number of stock options, Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) (known as TSRUs), RSUs, restricted stock awards or other performance-based awards that may be
 granted toany one individual during any 
36 -month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs, PS As and restricted stock grants count as three shares, while stock options and TSRUs count as 
one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2014 plan. The 2004 Plan provided that the number of stock options, TSRUs or otherperformance-based awards granted to any one individual during any 
36 -month period was limited to 8 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs, PS As and restricted stock grantscounted against the maximum available shares as 
two shares, while stock options and TSRUs counted as one share. As of December 31, 2015 , 494 million shares were available for award.
Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to
 a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.A. Impact on Net Income

B. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
RSUs are awarded to select employees and, when vested, entitle the holder to receive a specified number of shares of 
Pfizer common stock, including shares resulting fromdividend equivalents paid on such RSUs. For RSUs granted during the periods presented, in virtually all instances, the units vest after 
three years of continuous service from the grant date.
We measure the value of RSU grants as of the grant date using 
the closing price of Pfizer common stock. The values determined through this fair value methodology generallyare amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

All eligible employees may receive stock option grants. No stock options were awarded to senior and other key management in any period presented; however, stock options
were awarded to certain other employees. In virtually all instances, stock options granted since 2005 vest after 
three years of continuous service from the grant date and have a contractual term of 
ten years . In most cases, stock options must be held for a t least one year from the grant date before any vesting may occur. In the event of a sale ofbusiness or plant closing or restructuring, options held by employees are immediately vested and are exercisable for a period from 
three months to their remaining term, depending on various conditions.
We measure the value of stock option grants as of the grant
 date using, for virtually all grants, the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The values determined throughthis fair value methodology generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses

    D. Portfolio Performance Shares
 (PPSs)PPSs are awards granted to select employees which, when vested, entitle the holder to receive, a
t the end of the performance period, a number of shares within a possiblerange of shares of Pfizer common stock, including shares resulting from dividend equivalents paid on such shares. For PPSs granted during the period presented, 
the awardsvest after 
three years of continuous service from the grant date and the number of shares paid, if any , depends on the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer’slong-term product portfolio during a 
five -year performance period from the year of the grant date. The target number of shares is determined by reference to competitivesurvey data. The number of shares that may be earned over the performance period ranges from 
0% to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PPS grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of Pfizer common stock. The values areamortized on a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, 
as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of P fizer’s common stock, changes in the number of shares that areprobable of being earned and changes in management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and/or changes in
management’s
assessment of the probable vesting term.

er Return Units (TSRUs)TSRUs are awarded to senior and other key management. TSRUs entitle the holders to receive a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal 
to the differencebetween the defined settlement price and the grant price, plus the dividends accumulated during the 
five -year or seven -year term, if and to the extent the total value is positive. The settlement price is the average closing price of Pfizer common stock during the 
20 trading days ending on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant, asapplicable; the grant price is the closing price of Pfizer common stock on the date of the
 grant.The TSRUs are automatically settled on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant bu
t vest on the third anniversary of the grant, after which time there is no longer asubstantial risk of forfeiture. The target number of shares is determined by reference to the fair value of
 share-based awards to similar employees in the industry peer group.We measure the value of TSRU grants as of the grant date using a
 Monte Carlo simulation model. The values determined through this fair value methodology generally areamortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into

PSAs are awarded to senior and other key management. PSAs vest
 after three years of continuous service from the grant date. The number of shares paid, if any,  includingshares resulting from dividend equivalents, for awards granted in 2015, depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to 
two measures: (i) operating incomeover 
three one -year periods; and (ii) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as compared to the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (DRG Index) over the three -year performance period. The number of shares paid from awards granted in 2014 and prior depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer's TSR as compared to an
industry peer group, for the three-year performance period from the year of the grant date. The target
 number of shares is determined by reference to the value of share-basedawards to similar employees in the industry peer group. The number of shares that are earned over the performance period ranges from 
0% to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PSA grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of Pfizer common stock. The values areamortized on a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into

We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay
 directly for taxes, insurance, maintenance and otheroperating expenses or to pay higher rent when operating expenses increase. Rental expense, net of sublease income, was 
$243 million in 2015 , $216 million in 2014 and $233 million 
in 2013 . The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases follow:

Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-
insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost
and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or
substantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in theperiod in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued (see 
Note 17 ). 2015 Financial Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5D. A. Legal Proceedings
Our non-tax contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. We are the plaintiff inthe vast majority of these actions. An adverse outcome in actions in which we are the plaintiff
 could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue, a significantloss of revenues from that drug and impairments of any associated assets.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims,among others, often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual,
provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other matters, which can include merger-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that willvary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S.and in other countries. 
Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding
the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/orour cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of
 damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if suchdamages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength o
f our defenses; whether the action purports to be a class action and our view ofthe likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have
had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s
judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information about the Company that
 is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on ourreputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter.
 In addition, with respect to patent matters, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the productprotected by the patent. As a result of
 considering qualitative factors in our determination of principal matters, there are some matters discussed below with respect to whichmanagement believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are involved in numerous suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most of the suits
 involveclaims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of 
the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts 
to enforce, our patent rights with respectto certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to
 the challenges to the U.S. patents on a number of our products that arediscussed below, we note that the patent rights to certain of
 our products are being challenged in various other countries. We are also party to other patent damages suits invarious jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry
related to patent enforcement litigation. Additionally, our licensing and collaboration partners face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their
products that may impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such products. We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant 
to which one or more third parties is seekingdamages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for the alleged infringement of its patents due to our commercial or other activities. For example, our subsidiary, Hospira, is
involved in patent and patent-related disputes over its attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. If the marketed product is ultimately found
 toinfringe the valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages, or we may be prevented 
from further sales of such product. Suchdamages may be enhanced as much as three-fold in the event that we or one of
 our subsidiaries, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed the valid patent rights of athird party.

    Actions In Which We Are 
The PlaintiffSutent (sunitinib malate)
In May 2010, Mylan notified us that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to
 market a generic version of Sutent and challenging onvarious grounds the Sutent basic patent, which expires in 2021, and two other paten
ts that expire in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In June 2010, we filed suit against Mylan inthe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the infringement of those 
three patents. The patent expiring in 2020 was dismissed from the case prior to trial. In October 2014, the court held that the 
two patents expiring in 2021 were valid and infringed. In October 2014, Mylan appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit. In January 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the validity and infringement of the 
two patents expiring in 2021.
EpiPen
In July 2010, King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (King), which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz, 
Inc., adivision of Novartis AG (Sandoz), in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in connection with Sandoz 
’ s abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDAseeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with
epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.
Toviaz (fesoterodine)
We have an exclusive, worldwide license to market Toviaz from UCB Pharma GmbH, which owns the patents relating to Toviaz.
Beginning in May 2013, several generic drug manufacturers notified us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market generic
versions of Toviaz and asserting the invalidity, unenforceability and/or non-infringement of all of our patents for Toviaz that are listed in the FDA 
’ s list of Approved DrugProducts with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the “Orange Book”. Beginning in June 2013, we filed actions against all of
 those generic drugmanufacturers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the infringement of 
five of the patents for Toviaz: three composition-of-matter patents and a method-of-use patent that expire in 2019, and a patent covering salts of
 fesoterodine that expires in 2022. In June and July 2015, we settled with four of the eight generic defendants. The trial relating to the remaining defendants occurred in July 2015, and we are waiting for a ruling from the court.
Tygacil (tigecycline)
In October 2013, we received notice of a Section 505(b)(2) new drug application filed by Fresenius Kabi USA LLC (Fresenius) for a tigecycline injectable product. Fresenius
asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the basic patent for Tygacil that expires in April 2016, the formulation patent
 for Tygacil that expires in 2029 and the polymorphpatent for Tygacil that expires in 2030. In November 2013, we filed suit against Fresenius in the U.S
. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the validity andinfringement 
of the patents in suit. In November 2015, we settled our claims against Fresenius on terms tha t permit Fresenius to launch a tigecycline injectable product in theU.S. prior to the expiration of certain of the patents 
that were the subject of the challenge.In November 2014, Mylan Laboratories Limited (formerly Agila Specialties Private Limited) (Mylan Laboratories) 
notified us that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Tygacil. Mylan Laboratories 
asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the polymorph patent for Tygacil and the formulation patent for Tygacil. Mylan Laboratories has not challenged the basic patent. In January 2015
, we filed suit against Mylan Laboratories in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the polymorph patent and the formulation patent 
for Tygacil.In addition, in September 2015 and December 2015, we received notices of Section 505(b)(2) new drug applications filed by each of Mylan and Accord Healthcare Inc.
(Accord) for tigecycline injectable products. Mylan and Accord assert the invalidity and non-infringement of the polymorph patent for Tygacil, and 
two formulation patents forTygacil that expire in 2028 and 2029, respectively. In October 2015, we filed suit against Mylan in the
 U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of West Virginia asserting the validity and infringement 
of the patents in suit. In February 2016, we filed suit against  Accord in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Delaware and in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina asserting the validity and infringement 
of the patents in suit. Precedex Premix
In June 2014, 
Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. (Ben Venue) notified our subsidiary, Hospira, that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that a patent relating to the use of Precedex in an intensive care unit
 setting, whichexpires in March 2019, was invalid or not infringed. In August 2014, Hospira and Orion Corporation (co-owner of the patent in suit) filed suit against Ben Venue
, HikmaPharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma), and West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the validity and infringement of the patent
in suit. In October 2014, Eurohealth International Sarl was substituted 
for Ben Venue and Hikma.In June 2015, Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (Amneal) notified Hospira that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that 
four patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which expire in2032, were invalid or not infringed. In August 2015, Hospira filed suit against Amneal in the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Delaware asserting the validity and infringementof the patents in suit.
In December 2015, Fresenius notified Hospira that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Hospira’s
premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that 
four patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which expire in 2032, were invalid ornot infringed. In January 2016, Hospira filed suit against Fresenius in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting the validity and infringement of

 the composition of matter patent that contains claims that coverapixaban, the active ingredient in Eliquis, 
which is co-marketed by BMS and Pfizer. The patent expires in February 2023, but BMS has filed a request for patent termrestoration with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) which, if
 successful, will result in a patent expiration date of December 2026. The Petition was filed at the USPTOby the Coalition for Affordable Drugs and requests that the Patent
 Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) initiate a proceeding to review the validity of the patent, including claims thatcover apixaban 
. BMS responded to and opposed this Petition in November 2015 and, in February 2016, the PTAB rejected the Petition, declining to initiate a review of thepatent.
Action In Which We Are T
he DefendantEffexor XR (venlafaxine HCI)
In 2006, Wyeth and Wyeth Canada Limited (the Wyeth companies) filed an action in the Federal Court in Canada against Ratiopharm Inc.
 (Ratiopharm) seeking to preventRatiopharm from obtaining approval in Canada for its generic version of Effexor XR prior to the expiration of 
one of the Wyeth companies’ patents. As a result of that action,Ratiopharm was enjoined from obtaining regulatory approval for its generic product. However, in August 2007, the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada ruled that the patent at
issue could not be asserted against Ratiopharm under the applicable Canadian regulations governing approvals, and it dismissed the Wyeth companies’ action.
Following the dismissal, in 2007, Ratiopharm filed an action in the Federal Court in Canada seeking damages from the Wyeth companies for preventing Ratiopharm from
marketing its generic version of Effexor XR in Canada from January 2006 through August 2007. The Federal Court dismissed Ratiopharm’s action in 2011, but the Federal
Court of Appeal reinstated it in 2012. In 2011 and 2012, 
Pfizer made payments to Teva Canada Limited, which had acquired Ratiopharm, totaling Canadian dollars 52.5 million in partial settlement of this action.
The trial in this action was held in January 2014, and the court issued various findings in March 2014. On June 30, 2014
, the Federal Court in Canada issued a judgment basedon those findings, awarding Teva Canada Limited damages of approximately Canadian dollars 
125 million , consisting of compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest and legal costs. This judgment was satisfied by Pfizer Canada Inc., as successor to the
 Wyeth companies, in July 2014. In September 2014, Pfizer Canada Inc. appealed thejudgment.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other
products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation, which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In
connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other
claims. As of 
December 31, 2015 , approximately 55,450 claims naming American Optical and numerous other defendants were pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is now a
wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits are pending against Pfizer in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products containing asbestos
and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Gibsonburg Lime Products Company (Gibsonburg). Gibsonburg was acquired by Pfizer in the 1960s and sold products
containing small amounts of asbestos until the early 1970s.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned
by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Celebrex and Bextra
Beginning in late 2004, several purported class actions were filed in federal and state courts alleging that Pfizer and certain of our current and 
former officers violated federalsecurities laws by misrepresenting the safety of Celebrex and Bextra. In June 2005, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District
Litigation ( 
In re Pfizer Inc. Securities, Derivative and “ERISA” Litigation MDL-1688 ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In March 2012,  the court inthe Multi-District Litigation certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased or acquired Pfizer stock between October 31, 2000 and October 19, 2005
. In May 2014, thecourt in the Multi-District Litigation granted Pfizer’s motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ loss causation and damages expert. We
 subsequently filed a motion forsummary judgment seeking dismissal of the litigation, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to submit an amended report by their expert. In July 2014
, the court denied theplaintiffs’ motion for leave to submit an amended report, and granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety. In August 2014, 
theplaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit.118

•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual lawsuits and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us and/or our subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury as a
result of the purported ingestion of Effexor. Among other types
 of actions, the Effexor personal injury litigation includes actions alleging a variety of birth defects as a result ofthe purported ingestion of Effexor by women during pregnancy. Plaintiffs in these birth-defect actions seek
 compensatory and punitive damages. In August 2013, the federalbirth-defect cases were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation (In re Effexor (Venlafaxine Hydrochloride) Products Liability Litigation
MDL-2458) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Almost all plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their actions. The Multi-District Litigation, as well as
the coordinated state court proceedings in California, have been administratively stayed.
•
Antitrust ActionsBeginning in May 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth andcertain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Ef
fexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a classconsisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Ef
fexor XRfrom any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the
 time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch ofgeneric Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain o
f the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws ofcertain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Ef
fexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XRand entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each
 of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in theindividual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR in the U.S. and itsterritories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S
. District Court for the District of New Jersey.In October 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the o
ther directpurchaser plaintiff claims. In January 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct
purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Third Circuit. Motions to dismiss remain pending as to the end-payerplaintiffs’ remaining claims.
Zoloft
A number of individual lawsuits and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us and/or our subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury as a
result of the purported ingestion of Zoloft. Among other types o
f actions, the Zoloft personal injury litigation includes actions alleging a variety of birth defects as a result of thepurported ingestion of Zoloft by women during pregnancy. Plaintiffs in these birth-defect actions seek compensatory and punitive damages and 
the disgorgement of profitsresulting from the sale of Zoloft. In April 2012, the federal birth-defect cases were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Zoloft Products Liability Litigation MDL-2342 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A number of  plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their actions.Lipitor
•
Whistleblower ActionIn 2004, a former employee filed a “whistleblower” action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint remained under seal until
September 2007, at which time the U.S. Attorney for 
the Eastern District of New York declined to intervene in the case. We were served with the complaint in December 2007.Plaintiff alleges off-label promotion of Lipitor in violation of the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the false claims acts of certain states, and he seeks 
treble damages and civilpenalties on behalf of the federal government and the specified states as 
the result of their purchase, or reimbursement of patients for the purchase, of Lipitor allegedly for suchoff-label uses. Plaintiff also seeks compensation as a whistleblower under those federal and state statutes.
 In addition, plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully terminated, inviolation of the anti-retaliation provisions of applicable federal and New York law, and he seeks damages and the reinstatement of his employment. In 2009, 
the District Courtdismissed without prejudice the off-label promotion claims and, in 2010, plaintiff filed an amended complaint containing off-label promotion allegations that are substantially
similar to the allegations in the original complaint. In November 2012, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint. In December 2012, plaintiff appealed the District
Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In
 August 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack ofjurisdiction and sent the case back to the District Court for clarification of its ruling regarding the plaintiff’s employment claims. In November 2014, the District Court granted
plaintiff’s motion for a partial final judgment certifying the dismissal of the false claims counts, and plaintiff appealed the order dismissing those claims to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.
•
Antitrust ActionsBeginning in November 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain affiliates of Pfizer, and, in
most of the actions, Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) and certain affiliates of Ranbaxy.
 The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewideclasses consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic
Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the de
fendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in thelaunch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant
to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor, and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets
beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents
 for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things,treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition,
individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert
 claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantiallysimilar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have
2015 Financial Report

    been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) ( 
In re Lipitor Antitrust Litigation MDL-2332 ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims by direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with
prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave 
to amend their complaint tothe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Also, in January 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief onbehalf of the State of West 
Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions describedabove.
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes
 as a resultof the purported ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In February 2014,
 the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trialproceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (No. II) MDL-2502 ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina.
Chantix/Champix
Beginning in December 2008, purported class actions were filed against us in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Toronto Region), the Superior Court of Quebec (District of
Montreal), the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary, and the Superior Court of British Columbia (Vancouver Registry) on behalf of all individuals and
third-party payers in Canada who have purchased and ingested Champix or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Champix. Each of these actions asserts claims under
Canadian product liability law, including with respect to the safety and efficacy of Champix, and, on behalf of 
the putative class, seeks monetary relief, including punitivedamages. In June 2012, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified the 
Ontario proceeding as a class action, defining the class as consisting of the following: (i) all personsin Canada who ingested Champix during the period from April 2, 2007 to May 31, 2010 and who experienced at least one of a number of
 specified neuropsychiatric adverseevents; (ii) all persons who are entitled to assert claims in respect of Champix pursuant to Canadian legislation as the result of their relationship with a class member; and (iii)
all health insurers who are entitled to assert claims in respect of Champix pursuant to Canadian legislation. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified the class against
Pfizer Canada Inc. only and ruled that the action against Pfizer should be s
tayed until after the trial of the issues that are common to the class members. The actions inQuebec, Alberta and British Columbia have been stayed in favor of the Ontario action,
 which is proceeding on a national basis.Celebrex
Beginning in July 2014, purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Pfizer and certain subsidiaries of P
fizer relating toCelebrex. The plaintiffs seek to represent U.S. nationwide or multi-state classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased from the defendants,
 or indirectlypurchased or reimbursed patients for some or all of the purchase price of, Celebrex or generic Celebrex from May 31, 2014 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly
unlawful conduct. The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Celebrex in violation of federal antitrust laws or certain state antitrust, consumer protection and various
other laws as a result of Pfizer fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing a patent on Celebrex, engaging in sham litigation, and prolonging the impact of sham litigation
through settlement activity that further delayed generic entry. Each of 
the actions seeks treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges forCelebrex since May 31, 2014. In December 2014, the District Court granted the parties’ joint motions to consolidate the direct purchaser and end-payer cases, and all such
cases were consolidated as of March 2015. In October 2014 and March 2015, we filed motions to dismiss the direct purchasers’ and end-payers’ amended complaints,
respectively. In November 2015, the District Court denied in part and granted in part our motion to dismiss the direct purchasers’ amended complaint. In February 2016, the
District Court denied in part and granted in part our motion to dismiss the end-payers’ amended complaint.
Reglan
Reglan is a pro-motility medicine for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and diabetic gastroparesis that was marketed by Wyeth and a predecessor company
from 1979 until the end of 2001, when Wyeth sold the product and
 transferred the new drug application to another pharmaceutical company. Generic versions of Reglan havebeen sold by other companies since 1985. Pfizer, as Wyeth’s parent company, and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and limited liability companies, including Wyeth, along
with several other pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been named as defendants in numerous actions in various federal and state courts alleging a variety of personal
injuries, including movement disorders such as Tardive Dyskinesia, resulting from the use of Reglan and/or generic equivalents thereof. As of February 2016, we entered into
agreements in principle to settle virtually all of the known Reglan lawsuits on terms not material to Pfizer. We expect that the resolution of
 the remaining Reglan cases wouldnot be material to us.
A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and O
ther MattersAverage Wholesale Price Litigation
Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and other pharmaceutical manufacturers were sued in various state courts by a number of states alleging that the
 defendants providedaverage wholesale price (AWP) information for certain of their products that was higher than the actual average prices at which those products were sold. The AW
P is used todetermine reimbursement levels under Medicare Part B and Medicaid and in many private-sector insurance policies and medical plans. All but 
one of those actions have beenresolved through settlement, dismissal or final judgment. The plaintiff state 
in the one remaining action claims that the alleged spread between the AWPs at which purchasers were reimbursed and the actual sale prices was promoted by the defendants as an incentive to purchase certain of their products. The
 action alleges, among other things, fraud 
and violation of the state’s unfair trade practices and consumer protection statutes, and seeks monetary and other relief, including civil penalties and treble damages. 120

    Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and
spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000,
 Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia). Pharmacia then transferredits agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002.
Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s formeragricultural business. New Monsanto is defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural
business.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of
its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are limited to sites
that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spinoff
 that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for,any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s
assumption of, and agreement to, indemnify Pharmacia for these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to
 Former Monsanto’s chemical businessesin which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls.
Solutia and New Monsanto are defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical
businesses.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) a corrective measures study report with regard to Pharmacia’s discontinued industrial chemicalfacility in North Haven, Connecticut and a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to Wyeth Holdings Corporation’s discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound
Brook, New Jersey. In September 2010, our corrective measures study report with regard to the North Haven facility was approved by the 
EPA, and we commencedconstruction of the site remedy in late 2011 under an Updated Administrative Order on Consent with the E
PA. In July 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation finalized anAdministrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action with the EPA with regard to
 the Bound Brook facility. In May 2012, we completed constructionof an interim remedy to address the discharge of impacted groundwater from that facility to the Raritan River. In September 2012,
 the EPA issued a final remediation plan forthe Bound Brook facility’s main plant area, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our revised site-wide feasibility study. In March 2013, Wyeth
Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake de
tailedengineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for 
two adjacent lagoons. In September 2015, the U.S., on behalf of theEPA, lodged a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey tha
t will allow Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and toimplement the remedy for the main plant area. In December 2015, the consent decree was entered by the District Court. The
 estimated costs of the site remedy for the NorthHaven facility and the site remediation for the Bound Brook facility are covered by accruals previously taken by us.
India’s National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are actively reviewing various industrial facilities in the vicinity of Aurangabad,
India, to determine whether those facilities have contributed to alleged groundwater and soil contamination in the area. In July 2015, 
the NGT issued an order directing HospiraIndia, as the owner of a manufacturing facility in Aurangabad, to deposit approximately 
$1.8 million in escrow (subsequently reduced to $0.9 million ) to be applied to any required costs of remediation in the event Hospira India is determined to have responsibility for the alleged contamination. Subsequent to the NGT order, MPCB
 ordered theimmediate closure of Hospira India’s Aurangabad facility. Hospira India appealed the MPCB order and in November 2015, the closure order was overturned by the NGT.
We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and otherstate, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple
emerging markets in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges, and substantial fines and/or civil
penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from government investigations. Among the investigations by
government agencies are the matters discussed below.
In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil complaint in intervention in 
two qui tam actions that had been filed under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that Wyeth’s practices relating to the pricing for Protonix for Medicaid rebate purposes between 2001 and
 2006, prior to Wyeth ’ sacquisition by Pfizer, violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and federal common law. The two qui tam actions have been unsealed and the complaints include
substantially similar allegations. In addition, in 2009, several states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint under the same docket number in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts asserting violations of various state laws based on allegations substantially similar to those set forth in the
 civil complaint filed by the DOJ. OnFebruary 12, 2016, Wyeth and the DOJ reached an agreement in principle to resolve the actions pending in the U.
S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for $784.6 million 
. The agreement in principle does not include an admission of liability by Wyeth and is subject to the negotiation of final settlement agreements and court approval. 2015 Financial Report

    In 2012, Pfizer sold the UK Marketing Authorisation for phenytoin sodium capsules to a third party,
 but retained the right to supply the finished product to that third party. In May2013, the U.K. Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) informed us that it had launched an
 investigation into the supply of phenytoin sodium capsules in the U.K. market. InAugust 2015, the CMA issued a Statement of
 Objections alleging that Pfizer and Pfizer Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, engaged in conduct that violates U.K. and EU antitrust laws.A5. Legal Proceedings––Matters Resolved 
During 2015During 
2015 , certain matters, including the matters discussed below, were resolved or were the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in- principle.
Lyrica (pregabalin)
In May and June 2011, Apotex Inc. notified us
 that it had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Lyrica oralsolution and Lyrica capsules, respectively. Apotex Inc. asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the basic patent
, as well as the seizure patent that expired in October2013. In July 2011, we filed an action against Apotex Inc
. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the validity and infringement of the challenged patentsin connection with both abbreviated new drug applications. In January 2015, the District Court entered a stipulated dismissal, and as a result, 
Apotex Inc. cannot obtain FDAapproval for, or market in the U.S., its generic versions of Lyrica prior to the expiration of the basic paten
t in December 2018.Viagra (sildenafil)
In October 2010, we filed a patent-infringement action with respect to Viagra in the U.
S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Apotex Inc. and ApotexCorp., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan) and Mylan Inc. and Actavis, Inc. These generic drug manufacturers have filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA
seeking approval to market their generic versions of Viagra. They assert the invalidity and non-infringement of the Viagra method-of-use patent, which expires in 2020
(including the 
six -month pediatric exclusivity period resulting from the Company’s conduct of clinical studies to evaluate Revatio in the treatment of pediatric patients withpulmonary arterial hypertension; Viagra and Revatio have the same active ingredient, sildenafil).
In May and June 2011, Watson Laboratories Inc. (Watson) and Hetero Labs Limited (Hetero), respectively, notified us tha
t they had filed abbreviated new drug applicationswith the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of Viagra. Each asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the Viagra method-of-use patent
. In June and July2011, we filed actions against Watson and Hetero, respectively, in the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of New York asserting the validity and infringement of theViagra method-of-use patent.
In April 2015, we entered into settlement agreements with each of Mylan, Mylan Inc., Wa
tson, Actavis, Inc., Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. pursuant to which we grantedlicenses to the method-of-use patent permitting Mylan, Mylan Inc., Watson, Actavis,
 Inc., Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. to launch generic versions of Viagra in the U.S.beginning on or after December 11, 2017. In June 2015, we entered into a set
tlement agreement with Hetero pursuant to which we granted a license to the method-of-usepatent permitting Hetero to launch a generic version of Viagra in the U.S. beginning on or after December 11, 2017.
Celebrex (celecoxib)
In March 2013, the USPTO granted us a reissue patent covering methods o
f treating osteoarthritis and other approved conditions with celecoxib, the active ingredient inCelebrex. The reissue patent, including the 
six -month pediatric exclusivity period, expired in December 2015. On the date that the reissue patent was granted, we filed suitagainst Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva USA), Mylan, Watson (as predecessor to Allergan plc), Lupin Pharmaceuticals USA, 
Inc. (Lupin), Apotex Corp. and Apotex Inc.in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting the infringement of the
 reissue patent. Each of the defendant generic drug companies had previously filedan abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of celecoxib beginning in May 2014, upon the expiration of the basic patent
(including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period) for celecoxib. In March 2014, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, invalidating the
reissue patent. In May 2014, we appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court o
f Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.
In April 2014, we entered into settlement agreements with 
two of the defendants, Teva USA and Watson, pursuant to which we granted licenses to the reissue patentpermitting Teva USA and Watson to launch generic versions of celecoxib in the U.S. beginning in December 2014. In June 2014
 and October 2014, we entered into settlementagreements with Mylan and Lupin, respectively, pursuant to which we granted licenses to the reissue patent permitting Mylan and Lupin to launch generic versions of celecoxib
in the U.S. beginning in December 2014. In December 2014, Teva USA, Watson, Mylan and Lupin commenced marketing of generic versions of celecoxib.
Various Drugs: Off-Label Promotion Action
In May 2010, a purported class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of New York against Pfizer and several of our current and former officers. Thecomplaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making or causing Pfizer to make false statements, and by
 failing to disclose or causing Pfizer to fail todisclose material information concerning the alleged off-label promotion of certain pharmaceutical products, alleged payments to physicians to promote the sale of those
products and government investigations related thereto. Plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2012,
 the court certified a class consisting of all personswho purchased Pfizer common stock in the U.S. or on U.S. stock exchanges
 between January 19, 2006 and January 23, 2009 and were damaged as a result of the decline inthe price of Pfizer common stock allegedly attributable to the claimed violations. In January 2015, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the mat
ter for $400 million 
. In July 2015, the court approved the settlement. 122

    B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses,
 we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise inconnection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related
matters and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of 
the indemnification, we would be required toreimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not
paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2015 , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant. Pfizer Inc. has also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that it acquired and 
that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.C. Purchase Commitments
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had agreements totaling $3.7 billion to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and include amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administration services, and potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur.
Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
A. Segment Information
We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct businesses: an Innovative Products business and an Established Products business. The Innovative Productsbusiness is composed of 
two operating segments, each of which has been led by a single manager in 2015 and 2014––the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment (GIP) and the 
Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment (VOC). Effective February 8, 2016, the Innovative Products  business is led by a single manager. TheEstablished Products business consists of the 
Global Established Pharmaceutical segment (GEP), which is also led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have
achieved proof of concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. As our operations were not
 managed under the new structureuntil the beginning of fiscal 2014, certain costs and expenses could not be directly attributed 
to one of the new operating segments. As a result, our operating segment resultsfor 2013 include allocations. The amounts subject to allocation methods in 2013 were approximately 
$2.1 billion of selling, informational and administrative expenses and approximately 
$800 million of research and development expenses: •
The selling, informational and administrative expenses were allocated using proportional allocation methods based on associated selling costs, revenues or product-specificcosts, as applicable.
•
The research and development expenses were allocated based on product-specific R&D costs or revenue metrics, as applicable.Management believes that the allocations are reasonable.
We regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources.
Operating Segments
Some additional information about each business and operating segment follows:
Innovative Products Business
  Established Products Business Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment:
GIP focuses on developing and commercializing
novel, value-creating medicines that significantly
improve patients’ lives. Key therapeutic areas
include inflammation/immunology,
cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience/pain and
rare diseases and include leading brands, such as
Xeljanz, Eliquis, Lyrica (U.S. and Japan), Enbrel
(outside the U.S. and Canada) and Viagra (U.S.
and Canada).
  Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcaresegment:
VOC focuses on the development and commercialization of
vaccines and products for oncology and consumer
healthcare. Consumer Healthcare manufactures and markets
several well known, over-the-counter (OTC) products. Each
of the three businesses in VOC operates as a separate,
global business, with distinct specialization in terms of the
science and market approach necessary to deliver value to
consumers and patients.
  Global Established Pharmaceutical segment:GEP includes legacy brands that have lost or will
soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and
emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile
injectable products, biosimilars and infusion systems.
 
Additionally, GEP has the knowledge and resources within R&D to develop small molecules, including injectables, and biosimilars. On September 3, 2015, we acquired
Hospira, and its commercial operations are now included within GEP. Commencing from the acquisition date, and in accordance with our domestic and international reporting
periods, our consolidated statement of income, primarily GEP’s operating results, for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four months of
 legacy Hospira U.S. operationsand three months of legacy Hospira international operations. See 
Note 2A for additional information. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the 
three operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. 2015 Financial Report

    Other Costs and Business Activities
Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the
 following:•
WRD, which is generally responsible for research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate operating segmentfor possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. This organization also has
responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects. WRD is
also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.
•
Pfizer Medical, which, during the years 2013 through 2015, was responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties,transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, partnerships with global public
health and medical associations, regulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory compliance processes.
•
Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs,compliance and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.
•
Other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations not directly attributable to an operating segment.•
Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments toinventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) acquisition-related costs, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired
operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, which include non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for
legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.
Segment Assets
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as
 many of our operating assets are shared (such as our plant network assets) or commingled(such as accounts receivable, as many of our customers are served by multiple operating segments). Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review
any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total asse
ts were approximately $167 billion as of December 31, 2015 
and approximately $168 billion as of December 31, 2014 . Selected Income Statement Information

    Note 19. Pending Combination with Allergan plc
On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland, under
which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at 
$363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion , based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of 
$32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to the announcement) and certain other assumptions. Allergan shareholders will receive 
11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares by virtue of a share split, and P fizer shareholders will have the option ofreceiving 
one share of the combined company for each of their Pfizer shares or receiving cash instead of shares of the combined company for some or all of their Pfizershares, provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in 
the merger will not be less than  $6 billion or greater than  $12 billion . In the event that elections to receive cash and shares in the merger would otherwise result in an aggregate of less than  
$6 billion  or greater than  $12 billion of cash being paid out in the merger, then the share elections and cash elections will be subject to proration. The completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second half
 of 2016, is subject to certain conditions,including receipt of regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and EU, the receipt of necessary approvals from both Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and
the completion of Allergan’s pending divestiture of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. The merger agreement also provides that the businesses of
Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under the existing Allergan entity, which, subject to approval by Allergan shareholders, will be renamed “Pfizer plc.”
