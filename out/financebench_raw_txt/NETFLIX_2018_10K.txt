Business ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix
”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 
countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want,anytime, anywhere, on any inte
rnet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, overtwo million members in th
e United States ("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.We are a pioneer in th
e internet delivery of TV series and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed anecosystem for interne
t-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV series and movies directly on theirinternet-connected s
creens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV series and moviesdirectly over the internet.
Our core strategy is to grow our st
reaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuouslyimproving our members' expe
rience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts newmembers. In addition, we ar
e continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members candownload a selection of tit
les for offline viewing.BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three reportab
le segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derivesrevenues from monthly mem
bership fees for services related to streaming content to members in the United States. The International streaming segment derivesrevenues from monthly me
mbership fees for services related to streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derivesrevenues from monthly me
mbership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail.COMPETITION
The market for entertainment vi
deo is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such asmultichannel video progr
amming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providersand DVD retailers and more broad
ly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete againstentertainment video p
roviders and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.While consumers may ma
intain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments offree time. We have o
ften referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of1

Table of Contentstruth." In attempting to win 
these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content,which is increasingly exclus
ive and curated, and includes our own original programming.SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a s
easonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increasetheir viewing. Historical
ly, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and Internationalstreaming segments. O
ur membership growth can sometimes be impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Within our International streamingsegment, we expect each
 market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have alonger history to assess such pat
terns.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectualproperty as important to ou
r success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect ourproprietary intellectual property
. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounterdisputes over rights and obliga
tions concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.EMPLOYEES
As of 
December 31, 2018 , we had approximately 7,100 full-time employe es, of which approximately 6,900 supported our streaming segm ents.OTHER INFORMATION

laware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, Ca
lifornia 95032, and our telephone number is (408) 540-3700.We maintain a website at

Risk Factors If any of the following risks ac
tually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline, and you could 
lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business
If our efforts to attract and re
tain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We have experienced sign
ificant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our abilityto consistently provide our m
embers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies.Furthermore, the relative ser
vice levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract andretain memberships. Compe
titors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including thosethat provide pirated con
tent) and DVD retailers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existingfeatures, adjust pric
ing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract andretain members. In add
ition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfyour existing members ar
e not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adverselyaffected. Members c
ancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses,availability of content is 
unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Wemust continually add new memb
erships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow asexpected, given, in parti
cular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures orincrease our (per me
mbership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adverselyimpacted. If we are unab
le to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships,our business will be adversely a
ffected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketingexpenditures than we curren
tly anticipate to replace these members with new members.Changes in competitive offerings for ent
ertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impactour business.
The market for enter
tainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers haveincreasing options to acc
ess entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported andpiracy-based models. 
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damageour business, as its fundamenta
l proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light ofthe compelling consumer p
roposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters andcable network operators, as we
ll as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of thesecompetitors have long oper
ating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketingand other resources. They may s
ecure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,infrastructure, cont
ent acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings orapproaches to providing ente
rtainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If weare unable to successful
ly or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase ormaintain market share, revenue
s or profitability.The long-term and fixed cost nature of our content com
mitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results ofoperations.
In connection with licensing s
treaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter intomulti-year commi
tments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent
 agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixedcost”) but may be deter
mined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extentestimable under accoun
ting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II,3

Table of ContentsItem 7, "Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consol
idated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report onForm 10-K. Given the multiple-ye
ar duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet ourexpectations, our margins 
may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically requiremore up-front cash paymen
ts than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membershipand/or revenue growth do not mee
t our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments andaccelerated payment requirements of
 certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility inplanning for, or reacting 
to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorablyreceived by consumers in a 
territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixedcost nature of our content 
commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liabil
ity in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through ourservice.
As a producer and distributor of 
content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the natureand content of materials that
 we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service,including marketing ma
terials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming,including TV series and movies. W
e believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwiseattract and reta
in members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, ourbusiness, including our brand and resu
lts of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible forproduction costs and other expens
es, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk.Negotiations or renewals re
lated to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with ourproductions. We contract wi
th third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potentialliability or may suff
er losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent orengage in fraudulent behav
ior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights tothird parties, we coul
d become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove contentfrom our service, not to pl
ace licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might notbe well received by our me
mbers or could be damaging to our brand or business.To the extent we do not accura
tely anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removedfrom our service, or if we b
ecome liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims couldbe costly and the expenses and da
mages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnifiedagainst claims or costs o
f these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.If studios, content providers or other rights holders r
efuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could beadversely affected.
Our ability to provide our me
mbers with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distributesuch content and certain 
related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and theterms and conditions of such l
icenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certaincontent, including popular se
ries or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us contentupon terms acceptable 
to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for contentprovide for the studios or othe
r content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions wemay take, content avai
lable through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As weseek to differentia
te our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are alsofocused on programming an over
all mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles weadd and renew to our service. I
f we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.Music and certain authors
’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, weengage in negotiations with co
llection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain4

Table of Contentsrights to music and/or othe
r interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with theseorganizations, we could becom
e involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business.Additionally, pending and ongoing lit
igation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact ournegotiations with CMOs, or result in mus
ic publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability toreach licensing agre
ements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringementor otherwise increase our 
costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authorsand performers could expose us 
to greater distribution expenses.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our opera
tions internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members andfeatures related 
to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As ourinternational offe
ring evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular thosedealing with e-commer
ce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developingtechnology and utilizing th
ird-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number ofdisciplines, including cr
eative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production ofcontent. If we are not abl
e to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practicesrelated to our strea
ming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.We could be subject to economic, politica
l, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.Operating in international
 markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and otherrisks that may be diffe
rent from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks thatcould adversely affec
t our business, including:•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;•
political or social unrest and economic instability;•
compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economicsanctions, and local laws prohib
iting corrupt payments to government officials;•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;•
regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatoryrequirements or otherwis
e, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;•
foreign intellectual property laws, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact theeconomics of creating or 
distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;•
adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment indetermining our global 
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination isuncertain;
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenuesand expenses of our internat
ional operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;•
profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;•
differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;•
new and different sources of competition;•
censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service;•
low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;5

Table of Contents•
different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements;•
availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;•
integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control;•
differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy; and•
implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture andeconomic activity, in
cluding local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds.Our failure to manage any o
f these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.We are subject to taxation relat
ed risks in multiple jurisdictions.We are a U.S.-based multina
tional company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining ourglobal provision for income 
taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions areconsistent with the tax laws in 
the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned byjurisdictional tax au
thorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.Tax laws are dynamic and subje
ct to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enactedsignificant tax refo
rm, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the taxpositions of companies. Many count
ries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, ar
e actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we dobusiness. If U.S. or other foreign tax 
authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results ofoperations may be adverse
ly impacted.If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets 
establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able toattract or retain membe
rs, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a positive re
putation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, ouroriginal programming, is p
erceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputationmay be adversely impacted.
 To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatoryaction or behavior, includ
ing being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightenedregulatory scrutiny ac
ross our business and operations. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective orresult in negative re
action, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need toestablish our reputation wi
th consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may beadversely impacted.
Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our 
marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.We utilize a broad m
ix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service to potential new members. We maylimit or discontinue use
 or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potentialmembers deem certain marketing platf
orms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attractnew members may be adverse
ly affected.Companies that promote our se
rvice may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us.For example, if they decid
e that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longerhave access to their m
arketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we areunable to maintain or r
eplace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels andmarketing expenses may be 
adversely affected.6

Table of ContentsWe utilize marke
ting to promote our content and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively, we maynot obtain the expected a
cquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service avai
lable on their devices.We currently offer 
members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players,television set-top boxe
s and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service availablethrough the television set
-top boxes of these service providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumersdirectly for the Netf
lix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. We intend to continue to broaden our relationshipswith existing partners and to 
increase our capability to stream TV series and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful inmaintaining existing and 
creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to deliveringour streaming content to ou
r members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.Our agreements with our partn
ers are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, anumber of our partners do not con
tinue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree ofaccessibility and prom
inence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should beresponsible for the devic
es’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix andsuch dissatisfaction could 
result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionalitymay require that par
tners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment couldbe negatively impacted.
Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer syste
ms or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including thoserelating to cybersecurity or a
rising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including memberand corporate information, or theft of int
ellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.Our reputation and ability 
to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems andthose of third parties th
at we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, othernatural disasters, te
rrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general,could make our service unav
ailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errorsin our software or the unavai
lability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing andpotential members.
Our computer systems and those of 
third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks, both from state-sponsored and individual activ
ity, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systemsperiodically experi
ence directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data,confidential inform
ation or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive orconfidential information in 
order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectualproperty (including digit
al content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm ourbusiness, be expensive to remedy 
and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data andsystems, but techniques used to ga
in unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorizedaccess. Because of o
ur prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we haveexperienced an unauthori
zed release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service orsystems. There is no assurance 
that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses relatedto such disruptions or unauthoriz
ed access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop,implement and maint
ain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become moresophisticated, and may li
mit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service oraccess to our systems could r
esult in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or athird-party’s systems or o
ther misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, whichcould have a negative ef
fect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.7

Table of ContentsWe utilize our own communi
cations and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. Inaddition, we utilize thi
rd-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content deliverynetworks to help us stream TV seri
es and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting,“cloud” computing, or other n
etwork providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference,could adversely impact the
 experience of our members.We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate cer
tain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon WebServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) prov
ides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a"cloud" computing service. W
e have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other servicesprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast m
ajority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operationsto another cloud provider, any d
isruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.While the retail s
ide of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantageagainst our service, al
though if it was to do so it could harm our business.If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not opera
te to expectations, our business and results of operation could beadversely impacted.
We utilize a combin
ation of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed torecommend and merchand
ise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumerelectronic devices. For 
example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do notinterconnect with our CDN, or if we expe
rience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our memberscould be adversely impac
ted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandisingtechnology does n
ot enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected.We also utilize thi
rd-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technologyor that of third-part
ies we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment ofsoftware, our ability to ope
rate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ personal computers orother devices caused by softwa
re used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If government regulations relating to 
the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modificat
ion of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the mannerin which we currently conduct our bus
iness. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking tointroduce new or extend lega
cy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European lawenables individual memb
er states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. In addition, the continuedgrowth and development of the m
arket for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. Ifwe are required to comply wi
th new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incuradditional expenses or al
ter our business model.Changes in laws or regulations tha
t adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease thedemand for our service and 
increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal trafficthat traverse thei
r networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent.Furthermore, favorable 
laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty aroundthese rules, including chang
ing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local networkoperators, we could experien
ce discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwisenegatively affect ou
r business.8

Table of ContentsChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across the
ir networks could adversely impact our business.We rely upon the ability o
f consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our serviceover their networks, our servi
ce and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, includingmeaningful bandwidth caps, or oth
erwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and ourmembership acquisition an
d retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and eithercharge us for or prohibit us f
rom being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.Most network operators that prov
ide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,many network operators have an 
incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe thatconsumer demand, regulato
ry oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferentialtreatment to thei
r data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. Theextent to which these
 incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.Privacy concerns could limit our abili
ty to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact ourbusiness and reputation.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect andutilize data supplied by ou
r members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information, including but notlimited to Regulation (EU) 2016
/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”). Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groupsand governmental bodies for 
attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits.Increased regulation o
f data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data,could have an adverse eff
ect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our businessreputation could be advers
ely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject toadditional and/or more s
tringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localizationand/or restrictions on da
ta export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model orpractices to adapt to 
these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membe
rship data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorizedpersons.
We maintain personal d
ata regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of thirdparties we use in our operat
ions. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure suchinformation. We take 
measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services orother third-party serv
ices we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data. In the event of such a breach, current andpotential members m
ay become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notifyregulators about any actu
al or perceived data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection Authority) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incidentwithin strict time pe
riods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could bematerial, and we curr
ently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain employment and personal information concerning ouremployees, as well as persona
l information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ data occur,our business could be adversely a
ffected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our servi
ce using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, onlinewallets and direct ca
rrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of thesepayment methods are su
bject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in paymentprocessing fees, mater
ial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors,changes to rules or regula
tions concerning payment processing, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems orpayment products, including produ
cts we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adverselyimpacted. In certa
in instances, we9

Table of Contentsleverage third part
ies such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processingpayments on our behalf, we would have to 
transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impactmember acquisition and 
retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operationsand if not adequately c
ontrolled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate atacceptable levels, 
card networks may impose fines and our card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of our ability to process payments on any majorpayment method would signific
antly impair our ability to operate our business.If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate
ly protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brandand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affect
ed.We rely and expect to con
tinue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties withwhom we have relationships, as well 
as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforceour proprietary rights th
rough court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications.Nevertheless, these appli
cations may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties mayknowingly or unknowingly infringe our inte
llectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantialexpense to us. If the protec
tion of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content,and other intangible asse
ts may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of ourbusiness and service
 to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.We currently hold various do
main names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect ourreputation and brand and mak
e it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent thirdparties from acquir
ing domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.Intellectual property claims aga
inst us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streamingtechnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, tit
le selection processes and marketing activities.Trademark, copyright, pat
ent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to ourtechnology, business processes and th
e content we produce and distribute through our our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating someof our content, merchan
dising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual propertyrights. If we are unable to ob
tain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on atimely basis in response to 
claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our businessand competitive position
 may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect manyaspects of our business. There a
re numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patentsrelative to our techno
logy. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, resultsin costly litigation and d
iversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, ourrecommendation and me
rchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from ourservice, or remove consum
er products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology,enter into royalty or l
icensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, ifrequired, may be costly or un
available on terms acceptable to us.We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unfores
een expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention.
From time to time, we ar
e subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, wehave seen a rise in the numb
er of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringementclaims, employment r
elated litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes couldcause us to incur unforeseen 
expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention, any of which could n
egatively affect our business operations and financial position. We10

Table of Contentsalso from time to ti
me receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to relatedclaims and other actions relate
d to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legalproceedings is difficul
t to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters mayresult in, among other things, 
modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect ourbusiness operations and financ
ial position.We may seek additional capital that may result 
in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.From time to time, we may s
eek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operatingactivities have been n
egative in each of the last four years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available onour service. To the extent ou
r cash flows from operations continue to be negative, we anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capitalwill depend on, among other things, our bus
iness plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through theissuance of equity, equity-
linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and ourstockholders may experien
ce dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obliga
tions, which could adversely affect our financialposition.
We have a substantial a
mount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantialadditional indebtedness in 
the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $10.4 billion 
aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500 million 
unsecured revolving credi t facility. As of December 31, 2018 , we have not borrowed any amount under th is revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018 
, we had approximately $8.4 billion of total content liab ilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming contentcommitments that do not meet
 the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming contentobligations, including those not on ou
r consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidatedfinancial statem
ents included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtednessand other obligations, includ
ing streaming content obligations, may:•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our otherobligations;
•
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•
increase our cost of borrowing;•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general businesspurposes;
•
require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;•
limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates.Our streaming obligations in
clude large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in ourcash flows from operations by r
educing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at anunfavorable time, which m
ay negatively impact our stock price.We may not be able to generate suffici
ent cash to service our debt and other obligations.Our ability to make paymen
ts on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which issubject to prevailing e
conomic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business11

Table of Contentsand other factors beyond our con
trol. In each of the last four years, our cash flows from operating activities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a levelof cash flows from operating 
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and otherobligations, including amounts du
e under our streaming content obligations.If we are unable to servi
ce our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior tomaturity. Our ability to 
refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition atsuch time. Any refinancing or 
restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could furtherrestrict our business oper
ations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any ofthese obligations on comme
rcially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, or financia
l condition.If our cash flows are insuff
icient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could facesubstantial liquidity prob
lems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debtand other obligations. We c
annot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that theproceeds from such alte
rnatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternativemeasures, our business, results o
f operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire quali
fied employees.We rely on the continued se
rvice of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executiveteam and other key employ
ees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilledbusiness, product development, t
echnical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existingpersonnel, which may be disruptiv
e to our operations.Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Our partners, suppliers, vendors and we 
employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who aresubject to collectiv
e bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. If expiring collective bargaining agreements can notbe renewed then it is possible 
that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connectionwith these collective b
argaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production or byreducing profit margins.
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that s
tockholders may consider favorable.Our charter documents may d
iscourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;•
provide for a classified board of directors;•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and•
prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.As a Delaware corporation, we ar
e also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in abusiness combination with any holde
r of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board ofdirectors has approved the 
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.In addition, a merger or 
acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated ExecutiveSeverance and Retention Inc
entive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.12

Table of ContentsOur stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common s
tock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including thefollowing, some of which are beyond our 
control:•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income and free cash flow;•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;•
market volatility in general;•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and•
the operating results of our competitors.As a result of these and other 
factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.Following certain peri
ods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more suchlitigation following futu
re periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Preparing and forecasting our financial results r
equires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results. Given the dynamic nature of ou
r business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income andnumber of paid membershi
p additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline inthe trading price of our 
common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United 
States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,disclosures of contingent ass
ets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reportedperiods. We base such estim
ates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actualresults may differ from these
 estimates. For example, we estimate the amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensedor produced television ser
ies or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If we revise such estimates it could result in greaterin-period expenses, which could c
ause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.Item 1B.

ear ended December 31, 2018 increased 35% , including an increase of 24% and 53% in revenues in the Domestic s treamingand International str
eaming segments, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . International revenu es accounted for 50% of total streaming revenue for 
the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 45% of total streaming r evenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The increase in consolidated revenues was pri
marily driven by the growth in the average number of streaming paid memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in ourinternational memb
erships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 55% of total average str eaming paid memberships as ofDecember 31, 2018 
, as compared to 49% of total average streaming pai d memberships as of December 31, 2017 . In addition, average month ly revenue per payingstreaming membership 
increased primarily due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans. The growth in paid net membershipadditions has been le
ss volatile when compared to growth in total net membership additions as a result of free trial variability. We therefore believe paidmemberships is a more r
eliable indicator of revenue growth.The increase in operat
ing margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license andproduce content, including mo
re Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in ourstreaming service, our 
international expansion, and our growing content production activities.We offer three ma
in types of streaming membership plans. Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at atime. Our "standard" plan is our 
most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium"plan includes access to high d
efinition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. As of December 31, 2018 , pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month 
and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3 to $20 per month. We expect that fromtime to time the pr
ices of our membership plans in each country may increase and we may occasionally test other plan and price variations.The following represents the k
ey elements to our segment results of operations:•
We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. This represents each segment'sperformance before g
lobal corporate costs. As markets within our International streaming segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our globaloperating profit margin target
 as a measure of profitability.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues.Increasingly, we obtai
n multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streamingsegments based on estimat
ed fair market value.19

Table of ContentsExpenses associated with the a
cquisition, licensing and production of streaming content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associatedwith obtaining rights to music 
included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals),streaming delivery cos
ts and other operations costs, make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network("Open Connect") to help us effic
iently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, includeequipment costs relat
ed to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated withdelivering streaming 
content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay toour integrated payment p
artners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.•
For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to ourmarketing partners, in
cluding consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotionalactivities such as digi
tal and television advertising. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support theCompany's marketing activi
ties. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments in order to build consumerawareness of the stream
ing offerings, and in particular our original content.Segment Results

53% increase in our intern ational revenues was due to the 40% growth in the average number o f paid international memberships, in additionto a  
9%  increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to price changesand a shift in the plan mix

cember 31, 2017The increase in our eff
ective tax rate is mainly due to lower benefit on a percentage basis from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-basedcompensation as well as addi
tional expense related to foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted inDecember 2017. In 2018, the diffe
rence between our 1% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the r ecognition of excess taxbenefits of stock-based co
mpensation, Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), and updated adjustments related to U.S. tax reform as aresult of the U.S. federal t
ax return filing, partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses and the international provisions from the U.S. taxreform enacted in Dec
ember 2017.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax y ears beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition ofU.S. international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, theperiod in which the legisla
tion was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement ofcertain deferred 
tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP insituations when a registran
t does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete theaccounting for certa
in income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we havecompleted our analysis bas
ed on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in thefourth quarter of 2018 and a to
tal tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related toadjustments to the transiti
on tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.24

Table of ContentsYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended De
cember 31, 2016At the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corpo
rate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates. As a result of thisrestructuring and our inc
reasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.The decrease in our eff
ective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and an increase inforeign income taxed a
t rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In 2017, the difference between our (15)% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35%was $(244) million primar
ily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxed atrates lower than the U.S. statuto
ry rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductibleexpenses as well as the provision
al impact of changes to tax law.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, but are not li
mited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition ofU.S international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance withour understanding of the Act and guid
ance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in thefourth quarter of 2017, the pe
riod in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets andliabilities, based on th
e rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $47 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax onthe mandatory deemed r
epatriation of foreign earnings was $32 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $485 million. We also recorded a $67 millionbenefit related to 
foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. We have determined there is sufficient foreign sourceincome projected to ut
ilize these credits.25

Long-term debt, net of debt 
issuance costs, increased $3,861 million due to long-term note issuan ces of $1,900 million in April 2018 and $800 million and€1,100 million in October 2018. The ea
rliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021. As of  December 31, 2018 , no amounts had been borrowed under our $500 million revo
lving credit facility. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements. Weanticipate continuing 
to finance our future capital needs in the debt market, as we continue to believe that our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.Our ability to obtain this or 
any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts,business plans, operating perfo
rmance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on termsacceptable to us or at 
all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privilegessenior to the rights of our co
mmon stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.Our primary uses of cash includ
e the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.Cash payment terms for non-or
iginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular contentthat we produce and own, require mo
re cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advanceof when the content is avail
able on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content,particularly in orig
inal content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flowsfrom operations, avail
able funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for atleast the next twelve mon
ths.Free Cash Flow
We define free cash 
flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturitiesand sales of short-term 
investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cashgenerated that is ava
ilable to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, includinginvestments in global str
eaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as asubstitute for, net incom
e, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented inaccordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in re
lation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences areexcess content payments ove
r amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differencesinclude deferred revenue, ta
xes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferredrevenue is a source of cash 
flow.26

As of December 31, 2018 , streaming content oblig ations were comprised of $4.7 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.8 billion of "Non- current content liab
ilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.8 billion of obligations that are no t reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets asthey did not then meet
 the criteria for recognition.Streaming content obliga
tions increased $1.6 billion from $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 primarily due to multi-year commi
tments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.Streaming content obliga
tions include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production ofcontent includes non-ca
ncelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligationfor the acquisition and
 licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a contentliability is record
ed on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimatequantity and/or fees for whi
ch are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements wherethe number of seasons to be ai
red is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include anyestimated obligation 
for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknownobligations are expect
ed to be significant and we believe could include approximately $2 billion to $5 billion over the next three yea rs, with the paymentsfor the vast majority o
f such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgmentsand the actual amounts m
ay differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligationstable above.

Other purchase obligati ons include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloudcomputing costs, as well as othe
r miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of 
December 31, 2018 , we had gross unrecognized tax bene fits of $48 million which was classified in “Other non -current liabilities” and a reduction todeferred tax assets which was 
classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonablypossible adjustments to the b
alance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions wi
th unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we havefinancial guarantees, sub
ordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks,contingent liabilit

Indemnifications

m 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof the financial sta
tements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") hasdefined a company’s cri
tical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,and which require a company to 
make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We bas
e our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual result
s may differ from these estimates.Streaming Content
We acquire, license 
and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV series and films. The contentlicenses are for a f
ixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cashpayments relative to the amortizati
on expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classifiedwithin "Net cash used in operating 
activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, we capitali
ze the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost ofthe title is known and the ti
tle is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,net” and the remaining po
rtion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, we capitaliz
e costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. We include theseamounts in "Non-current conten
t assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization ofproduction costs.
Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on theConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with themonth of first availab
ility. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandisingand marketing efforts, an
d film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assetson an ongoing basis. Our estimates r
elated to these factors require considerable management judgment.29

Table of ContentsOur business model is subscription bas
ed as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed andproduced, are reviewed in agg
regate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of thecontent asset. To date, we have no
t identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated contentassets will be stated at 
the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected tobe, abandoned are written of
f.Income Taxes
We record a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Deferred income taxes are reco
gnized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carryingamounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assetsand liabilities of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, ifnecessary, by a valuation a
llowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.Although we believe our assumptions, judg
ments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of anytax audits could signific
antly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our abili
ty to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our pastoperating results, and our fo
recast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized indetermining future t
axable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.Actual operating results 
in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not thatmost of the deferred t
ax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxassets to the net amount th
at we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018 the valuation allowance of $125 million was primarily relatedto foreign tax credits 
that we are not expected to realize.We did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it ismore likely than not the 
tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefitsrecognized in the financial 
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At 
December 31, 2018 , our estimated gross unrecogn ized tax benefits were $48 million of which $44 million , if recognized, would favorab lyimpact our future ea
rnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may changeand the actual tax benefits
 may differ significantly from the estimates.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax y ears beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition ofU.S international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, theperiod in which the legisla
tion was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement ofcertain deferred 
tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP insituations when a registran
t does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete theaccounting for certa
in income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we havecompleted our analysis bas
ed on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in thefourth quarter of 2018 and a to
tal tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related toadjustments to the transiti
on tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.See Note 9 to the consolidated f
inancial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Ma rket RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currencyfluctuations. In July 2017, we sold al
l short-term investments.Interest Rate Risk
At 
December 31, 2018 , our cash equivalents were gen erally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paidon such funds fluctuates with the p
revailing interest rate.As of 
December 31, 2018 , we had $10.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed r ate unsecured debt in ten tranches due between 2021 and 2029. Refer to Note 4to the consolidated finan
cial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing inperiods of declining rat
es of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes inforeign currency rat
es, as discussed below.Foreign Currency Risk
International revenu
es and cost of revenues account for 49% and 58% , respectively, of consolid ated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The majority of interna
tional revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreigncurrency risk relat
ed to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexicanpeso and the Brazilian re
al.Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue andcontribution profit (loss
) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we believe our internat ionalrevenues would have been approxim
ately $94 million higher had foreign currency exch ange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2017 
. We have also experienc
ed and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurementof monetary assets and li
abilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recognized a $1 million foreign exchange loss
 due to the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European andU.S. entities, mostly offset by th
e remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.In addition, the effec
t of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease of $40 million . We do not use foreign exchange 
contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factorsthat we cannot forecast wi
th reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result suchfluctuations could have a s
ignificant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.

ticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evalua
tion, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls andprocedures as of the end of th
e period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required tobe disclosed by us in reports tha
t we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reportedwithin the time periods spe
cified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated toour management, including ou
r Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chi
ef Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or ourinternal controls will p
revent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the obje
ctives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must b
e considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected. 
(b)
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2018 
. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessm ent under the framework in Internal Control— Integrated Framework 
(2013 framework), our manage ment concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018 . The effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independ ent registeredpublic accounting firm, 
as stated in their report that is included herein. 
(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our intern
al control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
 to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix,
 Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control - IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix,Inc. (the Company) mai
ntained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related consolida ted statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity andcash flows for each of the th
ree years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and ou r report dated January 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related consolidated statements of operat
ions, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively referred t
o as the “consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financi
al position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its oper ations and its cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended 
December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opin ion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”
) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internetentertainment serv
ice with over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety ofgenres and languages. Members 
can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resumewatching, all without comme
rcials or commitments. Additionally, over two million members in the U.S. subscribe to th e Company's legacy DVD-by-mail service.Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amoun
ts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Segment Information presented in Note 11 have been reclassified to conformto the current period pr
esentation. Specifically, certain expenses for personnel that support global content and marketing that were previously classified in Generaland administrative exp
enses were reclassified to Cost of revenues and Marketing, respectively. In addition, expenses for personnel that support global streamingdelivery that were prev
iously classified in Technology and development were also reclassified to Cost of revenues. There is no change to consolidated operatingincome, net income or c
ash flows or DVD segment results as a result of this change in classification. See Note 12 for further detail.Use of Estimates
The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe financial stat
ements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates andassumptions include the str
eaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company basesits estimates on histor
ical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,the Company evaluates these 
assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing ac
counting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promisedgoods or services to customers, 
in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU2014-09 in the first quarte
r of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Because the Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membershipfees which are recognized
 ratably over each monthly membership period, the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not material.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash , which requires amounts gener ally described as restricted cash and restricted cashequivalents be included with 
cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cashflows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in the first qua
rter of 2018 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not material as the Company'srestricted cash balances are immaterial.
In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on 
the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Cuts andJobs Act (the “Act”). The GILTI provis
ions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In the firstquarter of 2018, the Company ele
cted to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.In August 2018, the SEC adopted the final rul
e under SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification , amending certain disc losurerequirements that wer
e redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. In addition,45

Table of Contentsthe amendments expanded th
e disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders' equity for interim financial statements. Under the amendments, an analysisof changes in each caption o
f stockholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement. The analysis should present areconciliation of th
e beginning balance to the ending balance of each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required to be filed. This final rulewas effective on November 5, 2018. The Comp
any adopted the rule in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements was notmaterial.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase t ransparency and comparability among organizations byrecognizing lease asse
ts and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that alessee should recognize a 
liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the leaseterm on the balance she
et. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using amodified retrospect
ive approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modifiedretrospective trans
ition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. While the Company is continuing to assess thepotential impacts of ASU 2016-02, the Comp
any estimates that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities for operating leases
 of approximately $700 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, wi th no material impact to its Consolidated Statements ofOperations.
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers investments 
in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company alsoclassifies amounts in tran
sit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.In July 2017, the Company sold all short-
term investments. The Company classified short-term investments, which consisted of marketable securities withoriginal maturiti
es in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments were reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in“Accumulated other comp
rehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on theinvestments, realiz
ed gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and otherincome (expense)” in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realizedgains and losses upon the sale of shor
t-term investments.Short-term investments we
re reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Companyreviewed factors such as th
e length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent tosell, or whether it would be mor
e likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.Streaming Content
The Company acquires, licenses 
and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV series and films.The content licenses ar
e for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require moreupfront cash payments rel
ative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, areclassified within "Net cash us
ed in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, the Company capit
alizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,the cost of the title 
is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Currentcontent assets, net” and th
e remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, the Company capita
lizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Theseamounts are included in "Non-cu
rrent content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with theamortization of produc
tion costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”on the Consolidated Statements o
f Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or 10 years, beginningwith the month of first ava
ilability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due toadditional merchandising a
nd marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. The Company46

Table of Contentsreviews factors impac
ting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerablemanagement judgment. 
The Company's business model is subscript
ion based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, bothlicensed and produced, are 
reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expectedusefulness of the content ass
et. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future,these aggregated conten
t assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that havebeen, or are expected to b
e, abandoned are written off.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of theestimated useful liv
es of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings arecapitalized and inc
luded in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.Revenue Recognition
The Company's primary source of r
evenues are from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership andrevenues are recognized ratabl
y over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted togovernmental authorit
ies. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have notbeen redeemed. The Company is th
e principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannel videoprogramming distributors 
(“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the service as the Company retains control overservice delivery to i
ts members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed, but in the case where the price that the memberpays is established by the par
tners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reductionof revenues.
Marketing
Marketing expenses consist pr
imarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs,mobile operators and ISPs. Advertis
ing expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed asincurred. Advertising expenses we
re $1,808 million , $1,091 million and $842 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Marketing expenses also inc
lude payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.Research and Development
Research and development exp
enses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research anddevelopment expenses were 
$1,218 million , $981 million and $768 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Income Taxes
The Company records a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liabilitymethod. Deferred income ta
xes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of exist
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferredtax assets and liabili
ties of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets isreduced, if necessary, by a v
aluation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.The Company did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a taxbenefit only if it is mo
re likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recogni
zed in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon sett
lement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statement
s for further information regarding income taxes.47

Table of ContentsForeign Currency
The functional currency 
for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. TheCompany translates the asse
ts and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end ofeach period. Revenues and expenses 
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from thesetranslations are re
cognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.
The Company remeasure
s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of eachperiod. Gains and losses from thes
e remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $1 million 
and $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and a gain o f $23 million for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2016.Earnings Per Share
 Basic earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings pershare is computed using the weigh
ted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during theperiod. Potential common sha
res consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is asfollows:

52

Table of ContentsIn 
July 2017 , the Company entered into a  $500 million  unsecured revolving credi t facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommittedincremental facility to increase the am
ount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional  $250 million , subject to certain t erms and conditions. Revolvingloans may be borrowed, repaid and 
reborrowed until July 27, 2022, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds offuture borrowings under the Revolving Cr
edit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of  December 31, 2018 , no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agre
ement.The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agr
eement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “AlternateBase Rate”) or (ii) a r
ate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of  0.75% . The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greates
t of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus  0.500%  and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-
month interest period, plus  1.00% . The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate fordeposits in U.S. dollars, for the re
levant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than 0.00% 
 per annum. The Company is also obligated to pay 
a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at a rate of  0.10% . The Revolving Credit Agreement requir
es the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries toincur debt and limit or 
restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of theCompany or a guarantor, merge, 
consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Companyand its subsidiaries, taken 
as a whole. As of  December 31, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.5.
Commitments and Contingencies Streaming Content
At 
December 31, 2018 , the Company had $19.3 billion of obligations comprised of $4.7 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.8 billion of "Non-current content liab

Content obligations include a
mounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollarcurrencies are tr
anslated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creativetalent and employment 
agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at thetime the Company enters in
to an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated BalanceSheets. Certain agreemen
ts include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable asof the reporting date. Tr
aditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples ofsuch license agreemen
ts. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, theunknown obligations are expected 
to be significant.Lease obligations
53

Table of ContentsThe Company leases facili
ties under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2034 . Several lease agree ments contain rentescalation clauses or 
rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company usesthe date of initial poss
ession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation forintended use. For scheduled rent 
escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, theCompany records minimum ren
tal expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company hasthe option to extend or renew mos
t of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.Because the terms of the Comp
any’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvementin the construction funding of 
the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Companyrecorded an asset of 
$41 million , representing the tota l costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of thebuildings), with corresponding li
abilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building 
assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December 31, 2018 , the lease financing obligation balance was 
$28 million , the majority of which is r ecorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining futureminimum payments under th
e lease financing obligation are $11 million . The lease financing oblig ation balance at the end of the lease term will be approximately$22 million 
which approximates the net book v alue of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.In addition to the lease 
financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $1,157 million as of December 31, 2018 related to non-cancelable operating leases for th
e expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the office space in Los Angeles, California.Future minimum payments unde

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in th
e normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employeerelations, business pract
ices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complexlegal proceedings are d
ifficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. TheCompany expenses legal fees as 
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be re
asonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operationsor its financial posit
ion, liquidity or results of operations.The Company is involved in litiga
tion matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at thistime. The Company's view of the ma

ess, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varyingscope and terms to business par
tners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach ofsuch agreements and o
ut of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other partymaking a claim pursuant t
o the procedures specified in the particular contract.The Company’s obligations under thes
e agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourseagainst third parties 
for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers thatwill require it, among oth
er things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The termsof such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to theconditional nature of th
e Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in theaccompanying consolidate
d financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.55

actors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.The Company calculates expe
cted volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in itscommon stock is more ref
lective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicatorof expected volatili
ty than historical volatility of its common stock.In valuing shares issued under th
e Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-couponissues with terms simila
r to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and thereforeuses an expected dividend yie
ld of  zero  in the option valuation mode l. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upongrant date.

e “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.Changes include, 
but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax y ears beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition ofU.S international taxation 
from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulativeforeign earnings as of Dece
mber 31, 2017. In accordance with the Act, the Company recorded $79 million as additional income t ax expense in the fourth quarter of2017, the period in which the legis
lation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the trans ition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of c
ertain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application ofU.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have 
the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detailto complete the accoun
ting for certain income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. Assuch, the Company has completed th
e analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 taxbenefit of 
$34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefitincluded 
$45 million related to adjustments to t he transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement  of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.58

and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities”in the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.The Company files U.S. Federal, state 
and foreign tax returns. In August 2018, the Company reached a favorable settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014& 2015 and recorded a discre
te tax benefit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2018. Th e Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016and 2017 and the state of Califo
rnia for the years 2014 and 2015. The 2009 through 2017 state tax retu rns are subject to examination by state tax authorities. TheCompany is also currently under 
examination in the UK for 2015 and 2016. The Company has no other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years2013 through 2017 remain subject to 
examination by foreign tax authorities.Given the potential outcom
e of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute oflimitations, it is r
easonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimateof the range of reasonably poss
ible adjustments cannot be made at this time.10.
Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) sav
ings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deduc
tions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at thediscretion of the Board. During 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company’s matching contr ibutions totaled $27 million , $20 million and $16 million , respectively. 11.
Segment Information The Company has 
three reportable segments: Dom estic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in thesame manner that the Comp
any’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. TheCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribut
ion profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost ofrevenues and marketing exp
enses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportablesegment because these o
perating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics. As markets within the Company's Internationalstreaming segment beco
me profitable, the CODM increasingly focuses on the Company's global operating margin as a measure of profitability.The Domestic streaming seg
ment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to the members in the UnitedStates. The International
 streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to members outside of theUnited States. The Domestic DVD segment de
rives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and therelated payment proc
essing fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographicregion from which the memb
ership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.Amortization of strea
ming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. The Company obtains multi-territory or global rights for its streamingcontent and allocates 
these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Amortization of content assets andother expenses associated wi
th the acquisition, licensing, and production of streaming content for each streaming segment thus includes both expenses directlyincurred by the
60

Table of Contentssegment as well as an allo
cation of expenses incurred for global or multi-territory rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are either attributed to theoperating segment based on a
mounts directly incurred by the segment or are allocated across segments by management. Marketing expenses consist primarily ofadvertising expenses and ce
rtain payments made to marketing partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, which are generallyincluded in the segment in whi
ch the expenditures are directly incurred.The Company's long-lived tangible 
assets were located as follows:

A paid membership (also re ferred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and amethod of payment being provid
ed, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members.A membership is canceled
 and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally becomeeffective at the end of the 
prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effectiveimmediately. Membe
rships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internalsystems, which utilize indust
ry standard geo-location technology.12.    Reclassification
 
The Company reclassified c
ertain streaming personnel-related expenses on its Consolidated Statement of Operations effective for the fourth quarter of 2018.Specifically, expenses fo
r personnel that support global content and marketing that were previously classified in General and administrative expenses werereclassified to Cost of r
evenues and Marketing, respectively. In addition, expenses for personnel that support global streaming delivery that were previouslyclassified in Technology and d
evelopment were also reclassified to Cost of revenues. The Company is making this change in classification in order to reflect howthe nature of the work perfo
rmed by certain personnel has changed to be more directly related to the development, marketing and delivery of our service as a resultof the continued evolution of 
the Company’s strategy to self-produce and create more of its own content rather than license or procure it from third parties. Thischange in classifica
tion will also align external presentation of personnel-related expenses with the way that the Company's chief operating decision maker expectsto assess profitability 
and make resource allocation decisions going forward. The Company has reclassified these personnel-related expenses for all prior periods inorder to present compar
able financial results. There is no change to consolidated operating income, net income or cash flows or DVD segment results as a result ofthis change in classifi
cation.The revised Consolidated State
ments of Operations as well as segment results for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, June 30,2016, 2017 and 2018, September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and Decembe
