 FULL -YEAR 2023  GUIDANCE:  
Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward -looking basis because the company 
is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, 
acquisition -related expenses and p urchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort.  These 
items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in 
accordance with GAAP.

COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs and required clinical trial expenses, 
associated with the Company's completion of its COVID-19 vaccine contractual commitments.
In the first and second quarter of 2023, the company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the Pharmaceutical segment to focus 
on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are 
primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development.  The 
restructuring expenses of $145 million in the quarter ($275 million Q2 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.
The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted 
earnings.European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the 
existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning 
in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has 
excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and 
assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.
