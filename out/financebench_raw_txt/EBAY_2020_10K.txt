BUSINESS Overview
eBay
 Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  wereincorporated in Delaware, and in S
eptember 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices arelocated
 at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California, 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated orthe
 context  otherwise  requires,  when  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us,”  or  “eBay”  in  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K,  we  mean  eBay  Inc.  and  itsconsolidated
 subsidiaries. Notably, on February 13, 2020, we completed the sale of StubHub to viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash, subject to certainadjustments,
 and on July 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”). Webelieve that the transaction with Adevinta will close by
 the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and othercustomary closing conditions.
eBay
 Inc.  is a  global commerce  leader  through  our  Marketplace  platforms  which  connect  millions  of  buyers  and sellers  in more  than  190markets
 around  the  world.  The  platforms  include  our  online  marketplace  located  at  www.ebay.com  and  its  localized  counterparts,  including  off-platform
 businesses in South Korea, Japan, and Turkey, as well as eBay’s suite of mobile apps. Our platforms are accessible through an onlineexperience
 (e.g. desktop and laptop computers), iOS and Android mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets) and our application programminginterfaces (“APIs,” platform access for third party software developers).
Agreement to Transfer eBay Classifieds Group
On
 July 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta for $2.5 billion in cash, subject tocertain
 adjustments, and approximately 540 million shares in Adevinta. Together, the total consideration payable under the definitive agreement isvalued
 at approximately $9.2 billion, based on the closing trading price of Adevinta’s outstanding shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on July 17,2020.
 We believe that the transaction will close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and othercustomary
 closing conditions. Please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “The closing of the proposed transfer of ourClassifieds
 business  is  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties,  may  not  be  completed  in  accordance  with  expected  plans  or  on  the  currentlycontemplated
 terms or timeline, or at all, and may not generate the anticipated returns to eBay, and the pending transfer may be disruptive to ourClassifieds business.”

Our StrategyAs a global commerce leader and third-party marketplace, our technol
ogies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a breadthof
 relevant inventory from around the globe, and to enable sellers’ access to eBay’s 185 million buyers worldwide. Our business model and pricingare
 designed so that our business is successful when our sellers are successful. We earn revenue primarily through fees collected on successfullyclosed sales and our growth drivers of managed payme
nts and first-party advertising.eBay’s
 strategy is to leverage technology to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers, to drive growth in Gross MerchandiseVolume
 (as discussed below, “GMV”), while increasing the rate of revenue growth through our managed payments and advertising initiatives, anddelivering
 healthy  operating  margins.  Following  the  announcement  of  the  StubHub  and  Classifieds  transactions,  we  stated  our  intention  as  anenterprise
 focused  on  our  Marketplace  platforms  to  embark  on  a  multi-year  journey  to  build  more  compelling  experiences  for  our  consumers,become the partner of choice for sellers and strengthen trust in relationships w
ith buyers.eBay’s
 managed payments has continued to expand and scale globally following the expiration of the PayPal Operating Agreement in July2020,
 delivering  buyers  and  sellers  a  simplified  end-to-end  payments  experience.  Starting  with  five  of  our  largest  markets  —  the  U.S.,  U.K.,Germany,
 Australia and Canada — we have focused on transitioning business sellers to the new payments platform, and we launched managedpayments
 for  consumer  sellers  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020.  As  a  result,  as  of  December  31,  2020  there  were  over  1  million  sellers  active  inmanaged
 payments. We also announced the first quarter of 2021 expansion plans to France, Italy, and Spain, along with enablement for eBay forCharity
 sellers in the U.S. and U.K. to leverage the experience. Through managed payments, we’re able to provide a simpler experience for currentand next-generation customers, consistent with today’s
 retail standards. We can offer buyers more flexibility and choice in how they’d like to pay andoffer
 sellers a more streamlined way to run their businesses. We continue to be on track to intermediate payments for the majority of our sellers in2021 and to complete the full roll-out for payments by 2022.
Our
 advertising business remains focused on growing our Promoted Listings (a first-party advertising offering) while reducing non-strategic,third-party
 advertising.  We  are  providing  sellers  with  data-driven  recommendations  to  optimize  their  conversion,  while  testing  and  building  moretechnology features to drive growth, position eBay as the sel
ler’s platform of choice, and surface relevant inventory to buyers.Our Customer Offerings
We
 provide a number of features for our buyers and sellers that align with our approach to becoming the partner of choice for sellers anddriving trusted buyer relationships. These offerings are des
igned to build trust and confidence on our platform, and drive GMV.In order to
 further strengthen our buyers’ confidence and trust in our services, we offer “eBay Money Back Guarantee,” which allows buyers toreceive
 their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or damaged, or does not match the listing. eBay Money Back Guaranteecovers
 most items purchased on the eBay platform in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, through a qualifying payment method. eBay alsoprovides
 buyers  with  a  “Best  Price  Guarantee,”  which  offers  buyers  in  the  U.S.  110%  of  the  price  difference  if  they  find  an  item  for  less  on  acompetitor’s website within 48 hours of
 making a purchase. In Australia, Best Price Guarantee beats deals from approved retailers by 5%, and in theU.K.,
 offers price matching. In 2020, eBay launched "Authenticity Guarantee," our new independent authentication service on all watches sold over$2,000
 in  the  U.S.,  and  expanded  the  service  to  the  collectible  sneakers  category,  authenticating  select  sneaker  styles  and  brands  on  themarketplace.
 Additionally, to meet consumer demand for top products, eBay launched a new destination to feature officially “Certified Refurbished”products from top brands.
On
 the eBay Marketplace platforms, the majority of transactions in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany include free shipping for buyers, and weencourage
 sellers to offer free returns. We also work to create confidence in our ability to meet buyers’ delivery and tracking expectations. In theU.K.
 and Australia, we launched eBay Virtual Tracking Number to substantially increase package tracking and provide buyers and sellers with easeand confidence.

To  become  the  partner  of  choice  for  sellers,  eBay  continuously  invests  in  resources  and  programs  to  grow  and  enhance  the  seller  toolsecosystem.
 Seller initiated offers allows sellers to send custom deals directly to buyers, and we launched several new features in this offering anddrove
 $1.25 billion in GMV in 2020. Additionally, a new collaboration with UPS launched in the U.S., helps provide sellers with more options tosupport
 their  shipping  needs  and  access  to  discounted  rates,  saving  them  time  and  money.  We  supported  seller  profitability  during  the  holidayseason
 by working with the carriers on our platform to eliminate peak season shipping surcharges on eBay. For sellers, eBay also launched newfeatures
 like “Image Clean-Up,” using computer vision to enable sellers to create cleaner images in their listing and optimize for Google Shoppingand
 “Time  Away,”  which allows sellers  to update their  listings  and protect  their  on-time  delivery  record  while they are on vacation  and providesbuyers
 with more accurate shipping estimates. Seller Hub capabilities continue to grow with the launch of several new features such as expanded“Multi-User
 Account Access” authentication capabilities, real-time competitive pricing, and traffic data and enhancement of our competitive pricinganalytics to include the search of item specifics in additi
on to Terapeak.During
 the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  put  specific  seller  protections  in  place  to  support  our  sellers’  businesses  during  carrier  delays,  notpenalizing
 sellers for delayed shipping or canceled orders to protect their seller performance standards. To accommodate for United States PostalService
 (USPS) delays, we protected sellers to ensure they were covered for any shipping defects and delays beyond their control by automaticallyextending
 estimated delivery dates as necessary to give buyers more reasonable expectations of when their items will arrive. We also waited toevaluate any “item not received” cases until after the extended, estimated del
ivery date.To
 help  sellers  keep  positive  momentum  in  their  business  during  the  pandemic,  we  increased  the  number  of  monthly,  zero  insertion  feelistings
 that we provide to most sellers. We also allowed all eBay Store subscribers to list additional, fixed price listings for free in order to test newinventory
 that buyers may be searching for in the COVID-19 environment, and we offered monthly, zero insertion fee listings in select categories forsellers enrolled in 
managed payments.In 2020, eBay launched new features lik
e Dark Mode to ease the shopping experience and create more accessibility for our customers; “GreatPrice
 Signal”  to  highlight  competitively  priced  items  from  trusted  sellers;  and  “Secure  Local  PickUp”  to  help  connect  local  buyers  and  sellers,allowing
 them to receive items quicker and more secure through the use of a QR code. More than 1,000,000 QR codes have been scanned sinceSecure
 Local Pickup’s launch in July. eBay’s Developer Program launched new APIs for managed payments, Offers to Buyers, eBay for Charity,and more, for developers to help their businesses thrive with eB
ay.Our Impact and Responsibility
eBay’s
 purpose  is  to  empower  people  and  create  economic  opportunity  for  all  through  our  technology  for  our  global  community  of  users.Every
 day, people build businesses on our platforms. With low cost of entry for sellers, we offer a highly accessible way for all types of users tointeract in a global marketplace that’s inclusive and connects peopl
e of all backgrounds. Accordingly, we prioritize our corporate responsibility effortsto
 impact the areas of economic empowerment and sustainable commerce. Key economic programs include eBay for Charity, the eBay Foundation,and our small business enableme
nt efforts, such as our Up & Running program.eBay
 for Charity empowers buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. In 2020, eBay for Charity matched donations made toFeeding
 America, Direct Relief, and Opportunity Fund, and offered U.S. shoppers the opportunity to buy Gifts That Give Back to support COVID-19relief efforts. In 2020, nearly $123 million was raised by buyers an
d sellers to support charities via eBay for Charity.The
 eBay Foundation helps to build economically vibrant and thriving communities. In 2020, the eBay Foundation granted over $16 million tosupport small business
es, untapped communities, and COVID-19 relief efforts, and offered an additional $2,500 per employee in matching gifts for atotal of up to $5,000 per employee. To date, the eBay Foundatio
n has awarded more than $65 million to more than 1,800 nonprofits.We
 are  champions  of  inclusive  commerce  and  in  2020,  born  out  of  the  pandemic  and  an  extension  of  our  Retail  Revival  program,  welaunched
 the Up & Running initiative to help more small businesses start and grow online. Through the program, new eBay sellers received feediscounts
 and resources to run their business on eBay. The Up & Running program saw global adaptations in over 25 markets around the world,and expanded efforts with the Up & Runnin
g Grants program, which will reward a number of eBay U.S. small business sellers a grant package worth$10,000.

eBay continued its work to reach its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025. We joined the U.S. EPA’s Green Power Program. Additionally,we
 strive to integrate best practices in our offices and data center operations and to continually reduce our environmental footprint. This year, eBaywas
 also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and responsible business on the DJSI World and North American Indices, and ranked onthe CDP A list.
Financial Information
We measure our footprint in our
 addressable market according to GMV. GMV consists of the total value of all successfully closed transactionsbetween users on our
 platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually completed the transaction. In 2020,we
 generated  $100  billion  in  GMV,  of  which  approximately  62  percent  was  generated  outside  the  U.S.  We  believe  that  GMV  provides  a  usefulmeasure
 of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms  in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV ofclosed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.
At
 the end of 2020, eBay had 185 million active buyers and over 19 million sellers. In 2020, we had approximately 1.6 billion live listingsglobally.
 The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that successfully closed a transaction on Marketplace platforms withinthe
 previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account. “Sellers” include consumer-to-consumer (“C2C”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) businesses and indiv
idual sellers on the platform.We
 generate revenue primarily from the transactions we successfully enable and through marketing services, and our growth initiatives ofpayments and advertising. The majority of our
 revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions closed on our platforms. We define “takerate” as net transaction revenues divided by GMV.
Our platforms are
 designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investments, such as in sales andmarketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology in
novation and customer service.Notable Business Transactions in 2020
We
 regularly  review  and  manage  our  investments  to  ensure  that  they  support  eBay’s  strategic  direction  and  complement  our  disciplinedapproach
 to value creation, profitability and capital allocation. In the first quarter of 2020, eBay completed the sale of StubHub to viagogo for $4.05billio
n in cash, subject to certain adjustments. In the third quarter of 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to transfer eBay Classifieds Groupto Adevinta; see “Agreement to Transfer eBay Classifieds Group” above for more details.
Competition
We
 encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through avariety
 of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and exportcompanies,
 auctioneers,  catalog  and  mail-order  companies,  classifieds,  directories,  search  engines,  commerce  participants  (consumer-to-consumer,
 business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden intonew
 categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels forthose new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and servic
es, and global scale.For
 more information regarding competitive factors impacting our business, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions“Substantial
 and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity andantitrust litigation under competition laws that coul
d adversely impact our business.”7

Government RegulationGovernment
 regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerceindustry
 in many countries where we operate. With nine additional states adopting Internet sales tax laws in 2020, some buyers across the U.S.encounter
 sales tax for the first time on eBay. To date, more than 40 states have implemented Internet sales tax and digital service tax legislation.Additionally, a digital service tax (DST) was impl
emented in Italy, India and Turkey in 2020, and we are complying with the legislation. In the U.K. thegovernment
 also approved the law to introduce a 2% DST. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex sales anduse tax collection, remittance and audit requirements coul
d create additional burdens for buyers and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms.For more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our business is subject to
extensive government regulation and ov
ersight” and “Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.”
Seasonality
We
 expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financ
ial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”Technology
The
 eBay Marketplace uses a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others.We
 have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer, seller and developer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications thathelp
 enable  our  users  to  reliably  and  securely  complete  transactions  on  our  sites.  Our  technology  infrastructure  simplifies  the  storage  andprocessing
 of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of theadministration
 of  large-scale  clusters  of  computers.  Our  infrastructure  has  been  designed  around  industry-standard  architectures  to  reducedowntime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences.
In
 support  of  our  commitment  to  innovation  and  a  better  customer  experience,  we  have  been  on  a  multi-year  evolution  to  modernize  ourmarketplace.
 Through  technologies  like  artificial  intelligence,  we  are  anticipating  the  needs  of  buyers,  sellers  and  developers,  empoweringentrepreneurs
 looking  to  grow  their  business,  and  making  the  platform  more  accessible  to  everyone.  We  aim  to  create  highly  personalized  andinspiring shopping experiences
 powered by advanced technologies.For
 information  regarding  technology-related  risks,  see  the  information  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “Systems  failures  orcyberattacks
 and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products or servicescould harm our business” and “Regulatio
n in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.”Intellectual Property
We
 regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectu
al property rights by relyingon federal, state and common
 law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractualrestrictions
 to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreementswith
 our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure ofour proprietary information.
We
 pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filedU.S.
 and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domainname,
 trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual propertyrights
 and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  besuccessful.
8

We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in placean
 active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable toregister
 or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain namesare
 not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  astrademarks or copyrighted material, to others.
From time
 to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.We
 are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item1A:
 Risk Factors” under the captions “The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners,including
 pirated or counterfeit items, may harm our business,” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual propertyrights and face ongoing risk from patent litigation and a
llegations by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”Human Capital Management
As
 of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 12,700 people globally. Approximately 6,000 of our employees were located in theU.S.
 eBay has robust people-focused programs to support and retain our employees globally and to attract our future employees. Our recruitment,development,
 compensation and benefits and wellness programs are designed to reflect our cultural values and our goal to make eBay competitivein the market for talent and a place that is welcoming and inclus
ive. eBay’s management is focused on delivering programs that develop and supportour people and connect them with our customers, our community, and each other.

Act with integrityPandemic Response
Adaptin
g to working during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major focus of our people programs. When companies were required to closetheir
 workplaces,  eBay  quickly  moved  to  facilitate  our  people  working  from  home.  eBay  provided  equipment,  systems,  and  resources  for  homeconnection,
 including for our customer experience team members who all shifted to working from home. In 2020, eBay made two payments to allemployees
 to  allow  them  to  cover  individual  needs  and  well-being.  We  also  increased  work  flexibility  to  balance  personal  and  professionalresponsibilities
 and provided back-up in-home child and adult care in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Ireland. eBay has continually engagedwith our people to support physical and menta
l health for them and their families through online wellness resources, webinars, telehealth access andexpansion
 of company-paid  mental  health  support  as well as additional training  for  managers.  In  recognition  of the extraordinary  circumstancesaffecting the team, we also provided an addition
al paid day off globally for all employees and contractors.9

Diversity, Equity and InclusioneBay’s
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program is focused on three strategic areas – workforce, workplace and marketplace. Equity is at theforefront
 of all we do to hire, grow, and keep top talent, enhance corporate performance, and foster a welcoming and inclusive place to work, learnand
 grow.  Starting  with  a  comprehensive  diversity  recruiting  strategy,  we  review  and  enhance  processes,  including  deepening  data  insights,updating
 learning and development practices and a new governance model to ensure that a diverse set of candidates are connected to eBay andcan
 see themselves as being successful here. Our Communities of Inclusion welcome and connect eBay employees all over the world to help usbuild and
 nurture employees, allies and external communities. They host events and forums to connect employees to groups organized around age,disability
 status,  ethnicity,  gender,  religion,  military  status,  parental  status  and  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  and  expression.  We  arecurrently preparing our fifth Global Diversity & Inclusion report for publicati
on later this year that shares stories and workforce data.Acting with Integrity
We
 reaffirmed and expanded our commitment to ethics and acting with integrity in 2020. We took big and small actions to ensure that we areopen,
 honest,  ethical  and  authentic  with  a  company-wide  webinar  meeting  and  a  series  of  leadership  trainings  with  an  outside  ethics  expert,quarterly “tone from the top” engagements between leaders with their employ
ees, and daily ethics contests during Ethics and Compliance Week.Parental Leave
In
 addition to competitive pay and benefits, eBay offers additional parental time off beyond what’s required by law in the U.S. and in mostcountries where
 we operate. This benefit is offered for parents welcoming a new child into the family whether by giving birth, adopting or welcominga child through surrogacy. This is an important demonstration of our commitment to working parents and the
ir families.Employee Voice & Values
In
 addition to multiple channels for sharing feedback, we also regularly survey our employees on trust and engagement, their experience withdiversity,
 equity  and  inclusion  as  well  as  ethics  and  integrity.  Our  employees  highly  value  eBay’s  approach  to  Impact  and  Responsibility  andDiversity,
 Equity & Inclusion discussed earlier in the report. These commitments are core to our business and they positively impact recruitment,engagement and reten
tion.Available Information

Risk Factors:You
 should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, aswell
 as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  informationregarding risks that affect
 us. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks thatmay affect us. Additi
onal risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors thatadversely affect our business.
Business, Economic, Market and Operating Risks
Our
 operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and d
ebt securities.Our operating and financial results have varied
 on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as aresult
 of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of ourbusiness, perio
d-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of futureperformance. It is
 difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately, particularly given that substantially all ofour
 net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it isalso difficult to
 forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in ourconsolidated financial statements may be sig
nificantly different from historical or projected percentages.Substantial and increasing
ly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.The
 businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of onlineand
 offline  companies  providing  goods  and  services  to  consumers  and  merchants,  a  number  of  which  have  significant  resources,  large  usercommunities
 and well-established brands. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels forthe
 sale  of  all  types  of  goods  and  services.  We  compete  in  two-sided  markets,  and  must  attract  both  buyers  and  sellers  to  use  our  platforms.Consumers
 who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants have more channels to reachconsumers.
 We expect competition to continue to intensify. The barriers to entry into these channels can be low, and businesses easily can launchonline
 sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number ofsuccessful
 ecommerce companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service ormarketing
 decisions  or  acquisitions  that  may  be  controversial  with  and  lead  to  dissatisfaction  among  sellers,  which  could  reduce  activity  on  ourplatform and harm our profitability.
We
 face  increased  competitive  pressure  online  and  offline.  In  particular,  the  competitive  norm  for,  and  the  expected  level  of  service  from,ecommerce
 and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buyinggoods,
 lower  (or  no)  shipping  costs,  faster  shipping  times  and  more  favorable  return  policies.  In  addition,  certain  platform  businesses,  such  asAlibaba,
 Amazon,  Apple,  Facebook  and  Google,  many  of  whom  are  larger  than  us  or  have  greater  capitalization,  have  a  dominant  and  secureposition in other
 industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If weare
 unable  to  change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commercemarketplaces,
 particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels (some of which depend on servicesprovided by sellers on our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to chang
es in larger platform businesses, our business will suffer.Competitors
 with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt moreaggressive
 pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Othercompetitors
 may  offer  or  continue  to  offer  faster  and/or  free  shipping,  delivery  on  Sunday,  same-day  delivery,  favorable  return  policies  or  othertransaction-related
 services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match.Competitors
 may  be  able  to  innovate  faster  and  more  efficiently,  and  new  technologies  may  increase  the  competitive  pressures  by  enablingcompetitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.
12

Some  of  our  competitors  control  other  products  and  services  that  are  important  to  our  success,  including  credit  card  interchange,  Internetsearch, and mobile operating systems.
 Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their productsand services in a manner that impacts our
 competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time totime
 made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable touse
 or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or losecustomers, which could cause our business to suffer.
Consumers
 who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,discount and
 general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their relatedmobile
 offerings, online and offline aggregation and classified services, social media platforms and other shopping channels, such as offline andonline
 home shopping networks. In the United States, these include, but are not limited to, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Walmart, Target, Macy’s,Etsy,
 StockX, Shopify, Wayfair, TheRealReal, Overstock.com and Rakuten, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of onlineand offline channels focused on o
ne or more of the categories of products offered on our site.Consumers
 also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items fromsellers
 of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as websites operated by Adevinta or Naspers Limitedand
 others  such  as  craigslist,  Oodle.com  and  Facebook.  Consumers  also  can  turn  to  shopping-comparison  sites,  such  as  Google  Shopping.  Incertain
 markets,  our  fixed-price  listing  and  traditional  auction-style  listing  formats  increasingly  are  being  challenged  by  other  formats,  such  asclassifieds.
We
 use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divertusers
 to  other  online  shopping  destinations.  Consumers  may  choose  to  search  for  products  and  services  with  a  horizontal  search  engine  orshopping
 comparison  website,  and  such  sites  may  also  send  users  to  other  shopping  destinations.  In  addition,  sellers  are  increasingly  utilizingmultiple
 sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites,such as Google, Naver and Baidu.
Consumers
 and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives, including general ecommerce sites, such asAmazon, Alibaba, Zalando and
 Coupang, and more specialized sites, such as Etsy. Our international sites also compete for sellers with general andspecialized
 ecommerce sites. Sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels, such as classifieds platforms. Consumers andmerchants
 also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services. In somecountries,
 there  are  online  sites  that  have  larger  customer  bases  and  greater  brand  recognition,  as  well  as  competitors  that  may  have  a  betterunderstanding
 of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  may  increasingly  compete  with  local  competitors  in  developing  countries  that  have  uniqueadvantages, such as a greater ability to operate under loc
al regulatory authorities.In
 addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturersmay
 attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goodsor
 services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to preventdistributors
 from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or drive distributors to sell at prices that would make us less attractive relativeto
 other alternatives. The adoption by those or other policies could adversely affect our results of operations and result in loss of market share anddiminished value of our brands.
The principal competitive factors for us include the follow
ing:    
•
ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;•
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;•
trust in the seller and the transaction;•
customer service;•
brand recognition;    13

•community cohesion, interaction and size;•
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;•
system reliability and security;•
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;•
level of service fees; and•
quality of search tools.We
 may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longeroperating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recog
nition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.The global COVID-19 pandemic cou
ld harm our business and results of operations.The
 global spread of COVID-19 and related measures to contain its spread (such as government mandated business closures and shelter in-place
 guidelines) have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts ourbusiness,
 results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  liquidity  in  the  future  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  cannot  predict,including
 the  duration  and  scope  of  the  pandemic;  any  resurgence  of  the  pandemic;  the  availability  and  distribution  of  effective  treatments  andvaccines;
 governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of thepandemic
 on  national  and  global  economic  activity,  unemployment  levels  and  financial  markets,  including  the  possibility  of  a  national  or  globalrecession;
 the potential for shipping difficulties, including slowed deliveries from sellers to their customers; and the ability of consumers to pay forproducts.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has generally resulted in a decrease in consumer spending, which could have an adverse impact on our sellersthrough
 reduced consumer demand for their products and availability of inventory, which could in turn negatively impact the demand for use of ourplatforms.
 Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to require employees to work remotely for an extended period of time, which couldnegatively
 impact our business and harm productivity and collaboration. If there is a prolonged impact of COVID-19, it could adversely affect ourbusiness,
 results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  liquidity,  perhaps  materially.  The  future  impact  of  COVID-19  and  these  containmentmeasures
 cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness, results of
 operations, financial condition and liquidity, and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and onterms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other li
quidity issues going forward.The
 COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures to contain its spread have not adversely affected our consolidated results of operations todate.
 Additionally,  to  date,  our  Marketplace  platforms  experienced  improved  traffic  and  buyer  acquisition  due  to  the  ongoing  impact  of  mobilityrestrictions
 taken globally to contain the spread of COVID-19 and changes in consumer behaviors that have resulted in more online shopping. Theimpacts seen may continue to
 create volatility in our results and a wider range of outcomes as consumer behaviors and mobility restrictions continueto evolve.
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchang
e rates, which could negatively impact our financial results.Because we
 generate the majority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial resultsare
 impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationallyfocused
 platforms are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from thelocal currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purp
oses.While
 from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict oreliminate
 the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  asignificant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.
14

Our international operations and engagement in cross-border trade are subject to risks, which could harm our business.Our
 international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and South Korea, and cross-border business from greaterChina,
 have generated a majority of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from ourforeign operations and expand i
nto international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•
uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions resulting from Brexit;•
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transactbusiness
 in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we mayhave limited or no experience;
•
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,language, and cultural differences;
•
stringent local labor laws and regulations;•
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  aparticular currency;
•
global or regional economic conditions that impact companies and customers with which we do business;•
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues (such as the coronavirus), acts of war, and terrorism;•
import or export regulations;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,as well as U.S. and foreign laws design
ed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•
antitrust and competition regulations;•
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•
payment intermediation regulations;•
local licensing and reporting obligations; and•
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. 
Violations
 of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,or
 sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although wehave
 implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  these  laws,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,contractors,
 or agents will not violate our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doingbusiness internationally an
d could harm our business.Cross-border
 trade  is  an  important  source  of  both  revenue  and  profits  for  us.  Cross-border  trade  also  represents  our  primary  (or  in  somecases,
 only)  presence  in  certain  important  markets,  such  as  Brazil/Latin  America,  China,  and  various  other  countries.  The  interpretation  and/orapplication
 of laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products, selective distribution networks, and sellers in othercountries listing
 items on the Internet, could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing, selling, shipping, or returning goods acrossnational
 borders. The shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Any factors thatincrease
 the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues andprofits and could harm our business.
15

Our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users tospend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and app
lications, including increased usage of other websites.Our
 users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:geopolitical
 events, such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity; natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding,wildfires,
 increased  storm  severity,  and  sea  level  rise);  power  shortages  or  outages,  major  public  health  issues,  including  pandemics  (such  asCOVID-19);
 social  networking  or  other  entertainment  websites  or  mobile  applications;  significant  local,  national  or  global  events  capturing  theattention
 of a large part of the population; and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert our usersfrom using our websites or mobile applications, our bus
iness could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends to a large degree on our abil
ity to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.Mobile
 devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms throughmobile devices. We may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobil
e and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety oftechnical
 and  other  configurations  across  different  mobile  devices  and  platforms  increases  the  challenges  associated  with  this  environment.  Inaddition,
 a  number  of  other  companies  with  significant  resources  and  a  number  of  innovative  startups  have  introduced  products  and  servicesfocusing on mobile markets.
Our
 ability  to  successfully  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapidly  evolving  market  for  mobile  transactions  is  crucial  to  our  continuedsuccess, and any failure to continuously increas
e the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.If
 we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments or continue to innovate and create new initiatives to provide new programs,products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could d
ecline.Rapid,
 significant  technological  changes  continue  to  confront  the  industries  in  which  we  operate  and  we  cannot  predict  the  effect  oftechnolo
gical changes on our business. We also continuously strive to create new initiatives and innovations that offer growth opportunities, such asour
 new payments and advertising offerings. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of ourcompetitors,
 for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries inwhich
 we  operate  will  continue  to  emerge.  These  new  services  and  technologies  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  wecurrently
 use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures andtake
 considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may beinhibited
 by  industry-wide  standards,  new  laws  and  regulations,  resistance  to  change  from  our  users,  clients  or  merchants,  or  third  parties’intellectual
 property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolvingindustry standards.
Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increas
e our costs and loss rate.Our
 eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded,have
 not  received  the  item  that  they  purchased  or  have  received  an  item  different  from  what  was  described.  We  expect  to  continue  to  receivecommunications
 from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Ourliabil
ity for these sorts of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is inthe
 United  States.  Litigation  involving  liability  for  any  such  third-party  actions  could  be  costly  and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  managementattention, result in increased costs
 of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affectedusers will likely complain to regulatory ag
encies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.16

Development of our payments system requires ongoing investment, is subject to evolving laws, regulations, rules, and standards, and involvesrisk, including risks related to our dependenc
e on third-party providers.We have invested and plan to
 continue to invest internal resources into our payments tools in order to maintain existing availability, expand intoadditio
nal markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers. If we fail to invest adequate resources into payments on ourplatform, or if
 our investment efforts are unsuccessful, unreliable or result in system failure, our payments services may not function properly or keeppace
 with competitive offerings, which could negatively impact their usage and our Marketplace. Future errors, failures or outages could cause ourbuyers and sellers to lose confidence in o
ur payments system and could cause them to cease using our marketplace.Our ability to expand our payments services into addition
al countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support this service.If
 we  transition  to  new  third-party  payment  service  providers  for  any  reason,  we  may  be  required  to  invest  significant  financial  and  personnelresources
 to  support  such  transition  or  could  be  unable  to  find  a  suitable  replacement  service  provider.  As  we  expand  the  availability  of  ourpayments services to
 additional markets or offer new payment methods to our sellers and buyers in the future, we may become subject to additionalregulations and compliance req
uirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. We
 rely on third-party service providers to perform services related to compliance, credit card processing, payment disbursements, currencyexchange,
 identity verification, sanctions screening, and fraud analysis and detection. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to ourdependence
 on third-party service providers. If any or some of these service providers fail to perform adequately or if any such service providerwere
 to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly, our sellers’ ability to use our platform to receive orders or payments could beadversely affecte
d, which would increase costs, drive sellers away from our marketplaces, result in potential legal liability, and harm our business. Inadditio
n, we and our third-party service providers may experience service outages from time to time that could adversely impact payments made onour
 platform.  Additionally,  any  unexpected  termination  or  modification  of  those  third-party  services  could  lead  to  a  lapse  in  the  effectiveness  ofcertain fraud prevention and detection tools.
Our
 third-party service providers may increase the fees they charge us in the future, which would increase our operating expenses. This could,in
 turn, require us to increase the fees we charge to sellers and cause some sellers to reduce listings on our marketplaces or to leave our platformaltogether by closing their accounts.
Payments
 are  governed  by  complex  and  continuously  evolving  laws  and  regulations  that  are  subject  to  change  and  vary  across  differentjurisdict
ions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to determine whether various licensingand registration laws relating to payments apply to us an
d to comply with applicable laws and licensing and registration regulations. In addition, therecan
 be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or retain any necessary licenses or registrations. Any failure or claim of failure on the part of theCompany
 or  its  third-party  service  providers  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  payments  could  require  us  to  expendsignificant
 resources,  result  in  liabilities,  limit  or  preclude  our  ability  to  enter  certain  markets  and  harm  our  reputation.  In  addition,  changes  inpayment
 regulations, including changes to the credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets, could adversely affectpayments on our platform and make our payments systems less profitable
. Further,
 we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements pursuant to agreements with ourthird-party
 payment processors. These rules and requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governingelectronic
 funds transfers, are subject to change or reinterpretation, making it difficult for us to comply. Any failure to comply with these rules andcertification
 requirements  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations  to  our  third-party  payment  processors  and  could  result  inpotential
 fines. In addition, changes in these rules and requirements, including any change in our designation by major payment card providers,could requir
e a change in our business operations and could result in limitations on or loss of our ability to accept payment cards, any of which couldnegatively
 impact our business. Such changes could also increase our costs of compliance, which could lead to increased fees for us or our sellersand adversely affect payments on our platform or usage of our payments services and Marketplace.

Our payments system is susceptible to illegal uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and payments to sanctioned parties. Ifour compliance program and internal controls 
to limit such illegal activity are ineffective, government authorities could bring legal action against us orotherwise suspend our ability to offer payment services in one or more markets.
We
 may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing risks from patent litigation and allegationsby third parties that we are infringing their intellectual pro
perty rights.We
 believe the protection of our intellectual property,  including our trademarks,  patents, copyrights,  domain names, trade dress, and tradesecrets,
 is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the UnitedStates
 and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rightswhen
 offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employeesand contractors and confidentiality agreements with p
arties with whom we conduct business.However, effective intellectual property protection may
 not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available,and
 contractual arrangements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing ormisappropriating
 our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  by  others.Trademark,
 copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. Wemust protect our
 intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and timeconsumin
g and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use ofour
 proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks orcopyright
ed material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failureto adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significa
nt costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.Additionally,
 we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits andhave been notified of several other potentia
l patent disputes.As
 the number of patent owners and products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and aswe
 acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual propertyrights
 of  others  and  we  may  become  increasingly  subject  to  patent  suits  and  other  infringement  claims,  including  copyright,  and  trademarkinfringement
 claims. Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we arecontractually
 obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming andcostly
 to  defend  and  resolve,  and  could  require  us  to  make  expensive  changes  in  our  methods  of  doing  business,  enter  into  costly  royalty  orlicensing
 agreements,  make  substantial  payments  to  satisfy  adverse  judgments  or  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  or  cease  conducting  certainoperations, which would
 harm our business.Failure
 to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severelydiminish merchant and consumer confidence i
n and use of our services.We
 face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may nothave received the goods that they
 had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some Europeanand
 Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. Whilewe
 can, in some cases, suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users, we do not have theability to
 require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our buyer protection program, which inthe
 United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee, or as we roll out our new payments capabilities, by compensating our sellers forfraudulent
 payments.  Although  we  have  implemented  measures  to  detect  and  reduce  the  occurrence  of  fraudulent  activities,  combat  bad  buyerexperiences
 and increase buyer satisfaction, including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending theiractivity,
 there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  measures  will  be  effective  in  combating  fraudulent  transactions  or  improving  overall  satisfactionamong
 sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of our services tobuyers or sellers, resulting in
18

a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damage to our reputation, or a diminution in the value of our brand names.Our business is subject to online security risks, includin
g security breaches and cyberattacks.Our
 businesses involve the storage and transmission of users’ personal financial information. In addition, a significant number of our usersauthorize
 us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us or, in certain cases, third-party  serviceproviders
 utilized  in  our  payment  services.  An  increasing  number  of  websites,  including  those  owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offlinecompanies,
 have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of theirwebsites
 or infrastructure. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third partiesmay
 be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any securitybreach at a company providing services to us or our users could have simi
lar effects.We
 may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.Additionally,
 our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breachesand we may not be able to fully collect, if at all, under these insuranc
e policies.Systems
 failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products orservices could harm our business.
Our
 systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service
 and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommun
ications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject tobreak-ins,
 sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  notsufficient for all eventualities.
We
 have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks and other events or conditions from timeto
 time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications, including our payments services.These
 events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or otherfunctionality
 of our websites and mobile applications or payments services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptionsin our services could cause current or potential users to believ
e that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoidour sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and bran
ds. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damagesto
 our  customers  or  their  businesses,  these  customers  could  seek  significant  compensation  from  us  for  their  losses  and  those  claims,  even  ifunsuccessful,
 would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by thirdparties
 and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or thesethird
 parties cease to provide the services or facilities. In particular, a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that weuse
 could cause system interruptions  and delays, result in loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions  in our services. We do not carrybusiness interrupt
ion insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failuresand similar events.
Our
 success largely depends on key employees. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,and
 develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key employees could harm ourbusiness.
Our
 future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees, including highlyskilled
 engineers and product developers, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate them. Competition for highly skilled individuals is intense,especially
 in the Silicon Valley where our corporate  headquarters  are located, and we may be unable to successfully  attract,  integrate  or retainsufficiently
 qualified  employees.  In  making  employment  decisions,  particularly  in  the  Internet  and  high-technology  industries,  employees  oftenconsider
 the value of their total compensation, including share-based awards such as restricted stock units, that they could receive in connectionwith
 their employment. In addition, our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse, welcoming andinclusive workplace.
 If our19

share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive, including due to fluctuations in our stock price, or our workplace isnot
 viewed as welcoming and inclusive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm our business.We do
 not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key employees and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. Theloss of the services of any of our senior management or other key employees, or our inability to attract highly qu
alified senior management and otherkey employees, could harm our business.
Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide servic
es to us or to our sellers could harm our business.A
 number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,merchant
 tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shippingproviders
 that deliver goods sold on our platform, managed payments intermediation, among others. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues(e.g.,
 strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers could harmour business.
Price
 increases by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clientscould
 also reduce the number of listings on our platforms  or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions,  thereby harming ourbusiness.
 While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their shipping experience,postal
 rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers’ offerings, and postal service changes could require certain sellers to utilizealternatives
 which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our sites, thereby harmingour business.
We have outsourced certain functions to
 third-party providers, including some customer support, managed payments and product developmentfunctions,
 which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which couldresult in user dissatisfaction and could harm our busin
ess.There
 can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or atall.
 If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our sellers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may beunable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner an
d on acceptable terms, or at all.Regulatory and Legal Risks
Our business is subject to extensive government regulatio
n and oversight.We
 are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumerprotection,
 data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, tax, antitrust and anti-competition,
 export requirements, anti-corruption, labor, advertising, digital content, real estate, billing, ecommerce, promotions, quality of services,telecommunications, mobile
 communications and media, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as well as laws and regulations intendedto
 combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. In addition, we are, or may become, subject to further regulation in some of theabove-mentioned areas or new areas as a result of the continu
ed development and expansion of our payments capabilities.Compliance
 with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies fromjurisdict
ion to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result ofchanges in
 these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractiveto
 our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.We
 have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurancethat our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and reg
ulations or our policies and procedures. 20

Regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.We
 are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our usersaround
 the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  dataprotection
 laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-partytransactions,
 but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercialrelations. These laws continue to devel
op in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.Regulat
ory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a numberof
 privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve overtime,
 both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provideservices
 to our customers that they may find to be valuable. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective inMay
 2018. The GDPR, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the European Union or related to products andservices
 offered  in  the  European  Union,  imposes  a  range  of  new  compliance  obligations  regarding  the  handling  of  personal  data.  The  GDPRimposes
 significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. Ifwe
 fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions,which
 can  result  in  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  worldwide  revenue,  private  lawsuits,  or  reputational  damage.  In  the  U.S.,  California  hasadopted
 the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which provides a new private right ofaction for data
 breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about theirdata
 collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. In addition to the CCPA, severalother
 U.S.  states  have  adopted  or  are  considering  adopting  laws  and  regulations  imposing  obligations  regarding  the  handling  of  personal  data.Compliance with the GDPR, the
 CCPA, and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can becostly
 and  time-consuming.  Complying  with  these  varying  national  and  international  requirements  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs  orrequire
 us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related  laws can result in significantpenalties.
A
 determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communications-based laws could also expose us tosignific
ant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In particular, becauseof
 the enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws that provide a specified monetarydamage award or fine for each violation (such as those descri
bed below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.For
 example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, orTCPA,
 in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers,including but not limited to text messages to mobile pho
nes. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500per violation, whichever is greater, and
 courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-actionlawsuits,
 as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits notcurrently
 alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormousnumber
 of  communications  we send to  our  users,  a determination  that  there  have been violations  of  the  TCPA or  other  communications-basedstatutes could expose us to significant damage aw
ards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post
 on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceivedfailure,
 by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacyor
 consumer  protection-related  laws  and  regulations,  including  the  GDPR  and  the  CCPA,  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental
 entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to changeour
 business  practices,  increase  our  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  business.  Data  collection,  privacy  and  security  have  become  the  subject  ofincreasi
ng public concern. If Internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a resultof these concerns, our
21

business could be harmed. We also have experienced security breaches and likely will in the future, which themselves may result in a violation ofthese laws.
Other laws and regulations could harm our busin
ess.It
 is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,trademarks,
 and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply toour
 businesses.  Many  of  these  laws were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and related  technologies  and,  as a result,  do notcontemplate
 or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do referencethe
 Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these lawsand
 regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  andregulations.
As
 our  activities,  the  products  and  services  we  offer,  our  investment  in  other  companies,  and  our  geographical  scope  continue  to  expand,regulatory
 agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to additional requirements (including licensure) or prohibited fromconducting
 our business in their jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions. For example, we have or will have investments inother
 companies (such as Adevinta and Adyen) that raise the potential for us to be deemed an investment company as defined by the InvestmentCompany
 Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an investmentcompany,
 such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment
 Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, whichwould
 have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny onlarge
 companies, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manneradverse to our businesses.
Numerous
 U.S.  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  the  State  of  California,  have  regulations  regarding  “auctions”  and  the  handling  ofproperty
 by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations uponus
 or our users, and others may attempt to do so in the future. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to beincreasing
 and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such asforcing us
 to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,and any of these outcomes could harm our business.
As
 we  expand  and  localize  our  international  activities,  we  are  increasingly  becoming  obligated  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  countries  ormarkets
 in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services tousers worldwi
de, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our serversor
 one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. Laws regulating Internet,mobile
 and ecommerce technologies outside of the United States are generally less favorable to us than those in the United States. Compliancemay
 be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on usor
 our  users  may  harm  our  business.  In  addition,  we may  be  subject  to  multiple  overlapping  legal or  regulatory  regimes  that  impose  conflictingrequirements
 on us (e.g., in cross-border trade). Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminalprosecution to significant fines to bans on our services, in ad
dition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions.We are regularly subject to general litigation, regu
latory disputes, and government inquiries.We
 are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedingsinvolving
 competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment,commercial disput
es, content generated by our users, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries haveincreased
 as our Company has grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services haveincreased in complexity. As the global regu
latory and legal landscape evolves, we may also become subject to product liability claims when productssold by third parties using our platforms result in personal inj
ury, or illness, or death or injury to property.22

The  outcome  and  impact  of  such  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.Regardless
 of  the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  ofmanagement
 resources,  and  other  factors.  Determining  reserves  for  our  pending  litigation  and  other  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-intensiveprocess
 that  is  subject  to  judgment  calls.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  require  us  to  make  substantialpayments to satisfy judgments,
 fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings couldalso result
 in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiringa
 change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any ofthese consequences could
 harm our business.We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competitio
n laws that could adversely impact our business.We
 are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competitionlaws.
 Some  jurisdictions  also  provide  private  rights  of  action  for  competitors  or  consumers  to  assert  claims  of  anti-competitive  conduct.  Othercompanies
 and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of theUnited
 States,  individual  states,  the  European  Union  or  other  countries,  or  otherwise  constitute  unfair  competition.  An  increasing  number  ofgovernments
 are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business partnerships oragreements
 or  arrangements  with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,particularly
 those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practicescould
 be deemed anticompetitive. Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims and investigations,even if
 without foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort andcould result in significant judgments ag
ainst us or require us to change our business practices.The
 listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeititems, may harm our business.
The listing or sale by our
 users of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner,has
 resulted  and  may  continue  to  result  in  allegations  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  for  unlawful  activities  against  us  (including  the  employees  anddirectors
 of our various entities) involving activities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, includinggovernment regulators
 and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regardingthe
 sale of counterfeit items, laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability (and by extension, the resale) of digital goods (e.g., books, music andsoftware),
 the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, and the sale of items outside of theUnited States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.
In
 addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatenedand
 actual litigation from time to time by rights owners. These and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner thatincreases
 costs,  lowers  revenue,  makes  our  websites  and  mobile  platforms  less  convenient  to  customers,  and  requires  us  to  spend  substantialresources
 to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices. In addition, we havereceived
 significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation, diminish thevalue of our brand names, and make users reluctant to use our products and services.
23

We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.Online
 services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  allegingdefamation,
 libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating tothe
 liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the UnitedStates and
 foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputationand our business.
Our
 potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where lawsgoverning
 Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service inany
 jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to thisliability, including exp
ending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.Interest Rate and Indebtedness Risks
Fluctuations in interest rates, and changes in regul
atory guidance related to such interest rates, could adversely impact our financial results.Investments
 in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value ofour
 fixed-rate  investment  securities  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  a  rise  in  interest  rates.  In  addition,  relatively  low  interest  rates  limit  ourinvestment income.
We
 have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and we may not generate sufficientcash flow
 from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of ourindebtedness, which could h
ave an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.We have
 a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including underour
 commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities. Our outstanding indebtednessand any additional ind
ebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:    
•
requiring  us to use a significant  portion  of our cash flow from  operations  and other  available cash to service  our indebtedness,  therebyreducing the amount of cash available for other purpos
es, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions;•
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adversechanges in general economic a
nd industry conditions;•
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;•
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends or other generalcorporate and other purposes may be limited; and
•
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.Tax Risks
Our business may be subject to sales and other taxes.
The
 application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax (“GST”) (including the “digitalservices tax”),
 business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes andregulations
 that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clearhow
 existing statutes apply to ecommerce services. In addition, many state and foreign governments are looking for ways to increase revenues,which
 has  resulted  in  legislative  action,  including  new  taxes  on  services  and  gross  revenues  and  through  other  indirect  taxes.  There  are  manytransactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determin
ation is uncertain.24

From time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on ourservices.
 These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful inthe future, which would harm our business.
Similar
 issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex andevolving.
 While we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due, some of our subsidiaries have, from time to time,received
 claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within thevarious countries
 in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of ourunique
 business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one ormore countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabil
ities.The
 determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and therecan be
 from time to time transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations,we
 are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determinationof our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreig
n tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a numberof
 investigations,  audits  and  reviews  by  taxing  authorities  throughout  the  world,  including  with  respect  to  our  business  structure.  Any  adverseoutcome
 of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financialstatements
 and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have establishedreserves
 based  on  assumptions  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  to  cover  such  eventualities,  these  reserves  may  prove  to  beinsufficient.
In
 addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of ourdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, oraccounting principles, as well as certai
n discrete items.Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-ke
eping obligations.The
 application of sales tax and other indirect taxes on cross border sales by remote sellers is continuing to change and evolve. On June 21,2018,
 the U.S. Supreme Court decided South  Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al.,  a case challenging the current law under which online retailers are notrequired
 to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer’s state. This decision allows states to adopt new or enforceexisting
 laws  requiring  sellers  to  collect  and  remit  sales  and  use  tax,  even  in  states  in  which  the  seller  has  no  presence.  The  adoption  orenforcement of
 any such legislation could result in a sales and use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers. This collection responsibilityand the additional costs associate
d with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens forbuyers
 and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms and could harm our business. Moreover, the application of such taxes on our commerceplatforms
 could cause a marketplace to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers, which could adversely impact our business, financialperformance,
 and growth. The majority of U.S. states have enacted laws or have pending legislation that require marketplace facilitators to collectand remit sales tax for some or all sellers using these marketplaces.
Similar laws imposing tax collection resp
onsibility on foreign sellers are being considered in other countries as well. We are now jointly liable forU.K.
 VAT and German VAT for certain sellers who fail to fulfill their VAT obligations unless we suspend their eBay activity until the seller resolvesthe matter with the corresponding VAT authority. Other jurisdictions are consideri
ng similar legislation.Multiple
 jurisdictions have enacted laws which require marketplaces to report user activity or collect and remit taxes on certain items sold onthe
 marketplace. The U.K. and European Union have also adopted a VAT reform package which starting in 2021 requires marketplaces such aseBay to collect and remit VAT on most imports from outside the European Union.

One  or  more  states,  the  U.S.  federal  government  or  foreign  countries  may  seek  to  impose  reporting  or  record-keeping  obligations  oncompanies
 that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance or if oneof our
 companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates. Certain of our companiesare
 required to report to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and most states on customers subject to U.S. income tax if they reach certainpayment
 thresholds. As a result, we are required to request tax identification numbers from certain payees, track payments by tax identificationnumber
 and,  under  certain  conditions,  withhold  a portion  of  payments  and forward  such  withholding  to  the  IRS.  These  obligations  can increaseoperational
 costs and change our user experience. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties andother
 sanctions and could harm our business. Imposition of an information reporting requirement could decrease seller or buyer activity on our sitesand would harm our business.
Transactional Risks
The
 closing  of  the  proposed  transfer  of  our  Classifieds  business  is  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties,  may  not  be  completed  inaccordance
 with expected plans or on the currently contemplated terms or timeline, or at all, and may not generate the anticipated returns to eBay,and the pending transfer may be disruptive to our Classifie
ds business.We
 believe the transaction will close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. However, the completion of the transaction is subject to receipt ofcertain
 regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the transaction willbe
 satisfied and, if those conditions are neither satisfied nor, where permissible, waived on a timely basis or at all, we may be unable to completethe transfer
 of the Classifieds business, or such completion may be delayed or completed on terms that are less favorable, perhaps materially, to usthan the terms currently contemplated.
If
 the proposed transfer of the Classifieds business is delayed or not completed for any reason, including due to our or Adevinta’s inability tosatisfy
 the closing conditions set forth in the transaction agreement or industry or economic conditions outside of our control, including those relatedto the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, investor confi
dence could decline and we could face negative publicity and possible litigation. In addition, in theevent
 of a failed transaction, we will have expended significant management resources in an effort to complete the transaction and, although insome
 circumstances  Adevinta  may  be  obligated  to  pay  us  a  termination  fee  of  $92  million,  we  will  have  incurred  significant  transaction  costs.Accordingly,
 if the proposed transaction of the Classifieds business is not completed on the timeline or terms currently contemplated, or at all, ourbusiness, results of operations, financial cond
ition, cash flows and stock price may be adversely affected.Upon
 closing of the transaction to transfer the Classifieds business, we will receive approximately 540 million Adevinta shares and, dependingon
 how  we  ultimately  determine  to  account  for  our  ownership  interest  in  Adevinta,  fluctuations  in  Adevinta’s  share  price,  financial  results  andfluctuations
 in exchange rates  could result in material changes in our consolidated  balance sheet and our consolidated  statement  of income. Inaddition,
 our ability to sell our Adevinta shares in the future will be subject to market conditions and other factors which could impact the value weare able to realize from any such sales.
Acquisitions,
 dispositions, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harmour business or impact our financial results.
We
 have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products. We have also disposedof
 significant businesses and recently announced a portfolio review of our Korea business. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a widearray
 of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions ofbusinesses, technologies, services, products, and oth
er assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.26

These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•
the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,following and continui
ng after announcement of our transaction plans;•
declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result fromchanges
 in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposedbusiness;
•
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;•
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,integration and administration;
•
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;•
the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrativesystems),
 technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costlyprocess;
•
the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  andexpenditures that may arise as a result;
•
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  toacquisition
 may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicablelegal and other standards;
•
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;•
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claimsor
 disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in thecase
 of dispositions, liabilities to the acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties andindemnities;
•
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which inand of itself may require regulatory approval and or additi
onal controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and•
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processesand
 the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statementsor make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.
    
We
 have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management andoperatio
nal control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent withours, and
 business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm toour reputation or adversely affect
 the value of our investment in the joint venture. Any circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adverselyaffect
 the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments, could harm our businessor negatively impact our financial results.
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that entitles us to acquire a fixed number ofshares of
 Adyen’s common stock subject to certain milestones being met. This warrant is accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic815, 
Derivatives  and Hedging.  Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility has had, and may continue to have in the future, asignificant
 impact on the value of this warrant. We report this warrant on a quarterly basis at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, andchanges
 in the fair value of this warrant are recognized in our consolidated statement of income. Fluctuations in Adyen’s common stock or otherchanges
 in assumptions could result in material changes in the fair value that we report in our consolidated balance sheets and our consolidatedstatement of income, which could have a material impact on our financi
al results.27

We could incur significant liability if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.We
 have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that our distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal toour
 stockholders on July 17, 2015 (the “Distribution”) qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the InternalRevenue
 Code. The opinion relies  on certain  facts,  assumptions,  representations  and undertakings  from  PayPal and us regarding  the past  andfuture
 conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings areincorrect
 or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant taxliabilities.
 Notwithstanding  the  opinion  of  tax  counsel  we  have  received,  the  IRS  could  determine  on  audit  that  the  Distribution  is  taxable  if  itdetermines
 that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with theconclusions
 in the opinion. If the Distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject toU.S. federal income tax and we could incur signific
ant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a resu
lt of the Distribution.We
 entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  therelationship
 of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal.  The indemnity  rights  we have against PayPal under  the agreements  may  not be sufficient  to  protect  us. In addition,  our indemnityobligations to PayPal may be sign
ificant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.28

        Common Stock
Our
 common  stock  has  been  traded  on  The  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  under  the  symbol  “EBAY”  since  September  24,  1998.  As  ofFebruary
 1, 2021, there were approximately 3,411 holders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are a significantly largernumber of beneficial owners of our common stock.
Dividend Policy
The
 company paid a total of $447 million and $473 million in cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31,2019,
 respectively. In February 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock to be paid on March 19, 2021 tostockholders
 of record as of March 1, 2021. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of theBoard
 of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, working capital, financial condition, results of operations, capitalrequirements, covenants in our credit agreement, applicab
le law and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.Performance Measurement Comparison

In  January  2019  our  Board  authorized  a  $4.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program  and  in  January  2020  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $5  billion  stock  repurchaseprogram. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under ourstock
 repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchasetransactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
During
 the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2020,  we  repurchased  approximately  $419  million  of  our  common  stock  under  our  stock  repurchase  program.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2020, a total of approximately $2.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. DuringFebruary 2021, our Board authorized an additional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.
We
 expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, ourstock
 repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety offactors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Business
eBay
 Inc., is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace platforms, that connects millions of buyers and sellers around theworld,
 empowering people and creating opportunity for all. Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one of the world’s largest and mostvibrant
 marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and abreadth
 of relevant inventory from around the globe and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytimeand anywhere. In 2020, eBay enabl
ed $100 billion of Gross Merchandise Volume.On
 February 13, 2020, we closed the previously announced sale of our StubHub business to an affiliate of viagogo. Beginning in the firstquarter of 2020, StubHub’s financial results 
for periods prior to the sale have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income as discontinuedoperations.
 Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  discontinued  operations  in  the  prior  periods  are  classified  asdiscontinued
 operations  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  See  “Note  4  –  Discontinued  Operations”  in  our  consolidated  financial  statementsincluded elsewhere in this rep
ort for additional information.In
 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues tospread
 throughout  the  world.  While  the  disruption  is  currently  expected  to  be  temporary,  there  is  uncertainty  around  its  duration.  As  a  result  ofCOVID-19
 mobility restrictions  globally, there have been changes in consumer behavior that have resulted in more online shopping. We expectthese
 changes in behavior to continue to evolve as the pandemic progresses. Our Marketplace platforms experienced improved traffic and buyeracquisition
 due to the ongoing impact of measures taken globally to contain the spread of COVID-19. The Marketplace platforms also experiencedimproved
 acquisition  of  small  business  sellers.  While  the  impact  of  COVID-19  has  had  a  positive  impact  on  our  reported  results,  it’s  uncertainwhether
 this  consumer  behavior  will  continue.  The  impacts  seen  to  date  may  continue  to  create  volatility  in  our  results  and  a  wider  range  ofoutcomes
 as consumer behaviors and mobility restrictions continue to evolve. See “Results  of Operations” below  for impacts of COVID-19 on ourresults for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For addition
al information, see “– Liquidity and Capital  Resource Requirements” below and “Item
 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “The global COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations” in Part II of thisreport.
On
 July 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) for $2.5 billion incash,
 subject  to  certain  adjustments,  and  approximately  540  million  shares  in  Adevinta.  These  shares  would  represent,  approximately  44%  ofAdevinta’s total
 outstanding shares and approximately 33% of Adevinta’s outstanding voting shares, based on the number of Adevinta’s outstandingshares as of June 30, 2020. Together, the total consideration pay

approximately $9.2 billion, based on the closing trading price of Adevinta shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on July 17, 2020. We believe thetransactio
n will close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of certainregulatory
 approvals and other risks and uncertainties. We have classified the results of our Classifieds business as discontinued operations in ourconsolidated
 statement  of  income  for  the  periods  presented.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  discontinuedoperations
 are classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. See “Note 4 – Discontinued Operations” in our consolidated financialstatements included elsewhere in this report for additio
nal information.Presentation
In addition to
 the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measuresin reviewing our financial results.
 The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-GAAP
 financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-Neutral
 information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information providedbelow
 in  “Non-GAAP  Measures  of  Financial  Performance,”  which  includes  reconciliations  of  FX-Neutral  financial  measures  to  the  most  directlycomparable
 GAAP  measures.  We  calculate  the  year-over-year  impact  of  foreign  currency  movements  using  prior  period  foreign  currency  ratesapplied to current year transactional currency amounts.
Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are den
ominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound,euro,
 Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the factthat
 we  generate  a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  internationally,  including  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  we  aresubject to the risks related to doing business in foreign co
untries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”The
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2020 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar againstthe Korean won, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dol
lar against the euro.Fiscal Year Highlights
Net
 revenues increased 19% to $10.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by improved traffic and buyer acquisition, which weattribute
 primarily to global restrictions implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19 which resulted in more online shopping during 2020. FX-Neutral
 net  revenue  (as  defined  above)  increased  20%  in  2020  compared  to  2019.  Operating  margin  increased  to  26.4%  in  2020  compared  to21.6% in 2019.
We generated cash flow from
 continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2020 compared to $2.6 billion in 2019, ending the year with cash,cash equivalents and non-eq
uity investments for continuing operations of $4.1 billion.During 2020,
 we issued senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion, which consisted of $800 million of 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025 and $950million
 of 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030. In addition, we repaid approximately $1.8 billion of debt comprising of $500 million of 2.150% seniorfixed
 rate notes due 2020, $500 million of 3.250% senior fixed rate notes due 2020 and $750 million related to 2.875% senior fixed rate notes due2021. We also repurchased $5.1 billi
on of shares and paid $447 million in dividends during 2020.Diluted
 earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations  was  $3.54  in  2020  compared  to  diluted  earnings  per  share  of  $1.77  in  2019.  InFebruary
 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock to be paid on March 19, 2021 to stockholders of recordas of March 1, 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet Revenues
Seasonality
We
 expect  transaction  activity  patterns  on  our  platforms  to  mirror  general  consumer  buying  patterns  and  expect  that  these  trends  willcontinue.
 As  we  introduce  new  products  and  platforms,  such  as  managed  payments,  we  expect  net  revenues  to  fluctuate.  In  addition,macroeconomic
 conditions, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may also contribute to fluctuations in revenues and margins. The followingtable
 sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues (in millions, exceptpercentages):

 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of $1 million, an unfavorableimpact
 of $153 million and a favorable impact of $139 million on net revenues for the years December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Theeffect
 of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollaragainst
 the  Korean  won,  partially  offset  by  the  weakening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  against  the  euro.  The  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  ratemovements
 in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Koreanwon.

Net Revenues by TypeWe generate two types of net revenues:
Net transaction revenues
 primarily  include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees fromsellers
 on our platforms. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprisesellers.
 Our  net  transaction  revenues  are  reduced  by  incentives,  including  discounts,  coupons  and  rewards,  provided  to  ourcustomers.
Marketing
 services and other ("MS&O") revenues consist  of revenues principally from the sale of advertisements, revenuesharing arrangements and first-party inventory programs.

Key Operating Metrics
Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net transaction revenues.
GMV
 consists  of  the  total  value  of  all  successfully  closed  transactions  between  users  on  our  platforms  during  the  applicableperiod,
 regardless  of  whether  the  buyer  and  seller  actually  consummated  the  transaction.  Despite  GMV’s  divergence  fromrevenue,
 we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through ourplatforms in a given period, notwithstanding the i
nclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.Take rate
 is defined as net transaction revenues divide d by GMV.The following table presents GMV and take rate for the periods presente

Marketplace  net transaction revenues were net of $15 million,  $81 million and $8 million hedging activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018respectively.
Net
 transaction  revenues  increased  in  2020  compared  to  2019  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  GMV  due  to  improved  traffic  and  buyeracquisition due to global restrictions imp
lemented to contain the spread of COVID-19 which resulted in consumers engaging in more online shoppingduring
 2020 and  higher  take  rate  due  to  the  expansion  of  managed  payments  and  promoted  listings.  Transaction  take  rate  was  higher  in  2020compared
 to 2019, due to the expansion of managed payments and due to promoted listings, which along with final value fees are calculated as apercentage of an item’s sale price and category mix.
Net
 transaction  revenues  increased  in  2019  compared  to  2018  primarily  due  to  growth  in  promoted  listing  fees  and  a  higher  take  rate.Transaction
 take rate was higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final value fees arecalculated
 as a percentage of an item’s sale price, and category mix. The increase in net transaction revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was dueto take rate
 considerations discussed above, despite declining GMV. We expect that the divergence between net transaction revenues and GMV willcontinue.
 Despite GMV’s divergence from net transaction revenues during the year, we still believe the metric provides a useful measure of overallvolume of closed transactions that flow through the platform in a given peri
od.Marketing Services and Other Revenues

The
 decrease in MS&O revenues during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenues that was driven byour
 ongoing  shift  to  promoted  listing  fees,  which  are  recognized  in  net  transaction  revenues  and  lower  revenues  resulting  from  the  sale  ofbrands4friends. These decreases were partial
ly offset by increases in first-party inventory program in Korea in 2019 compared to 2018.(1)38

Cost of Net RevenuesCost
 of  net  revenues  primarily  consists  of  costs  associated  with  customer  support,  site  operations,  costs  of  goods  sold  and  paymentprocessing.
 Significant components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment andamortization
 expense, first party inventory costs, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees and digital services tax. Thefollowing table presents cost of net revenues (in milli
ons, except percentages):

24.1 % 24.7 % 23.4 % The increase
 in cost of net revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in payment processing costs as we continueto
 transition customers to our payments platform and an increase in cost of goods sold related to our first-party inventory program in Korea. Theincrease in cost of net revenues was partially offset by lower cost of goods sold d
ue to the sale of brands4friends in the third quarter of 2019.The
 increase in cost of net revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in site operation and payment processingcosts as we increased our investments in our business, and an i
ncrease in costs of goods sold driven by our first-party inventory program in Korea.Cost
 of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $7 million attributable to foreign currency movementsrelative
 to the U.S. dollar in 2020 compared to 2019. Cost of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $49million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2

n operating expenses in 2020 and 2019.39

Sales and Marketing 
Sales
 and  marketing  expenses  primarily  consist  of  advertising  and  marketing  program  costs  (both  online  and  offline),  employeecompensation,
 certain  user  coupons  and  rewards,  contractor  costs,  facilities  costs  and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Online  marketing  expensesrepresent
 traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline advertising primarilyincludes brand campaigns an
d buyer/seller communications.The
 increase in sales and marketing expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in online and offline advertisingexpenses and employee-related costs.
The
 decrease  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  a  favorable  impact  from  foreign  currencymovements
 relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases in offline advertising spend and employee-related costs. These costs were partially offset byonline marketing spend and user cou
pons and rewards largely driven by our Japan platform acquired in the second quarter of 2018. Product Development
 
Product
 development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment.Product
 development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  product  development  efforts,  including  thedevelopment
 and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include payment intermediation capabilities and improvedseller tools and buyer experiences bu
ilt on a foundation of structured data.Capitalized
 internal use and platform development costs were $129 million and $137 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are primarilyreflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
The increase in product development exp
enses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs.The decrease in
 product development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs, foreigncurrency movement relative to the U.S. dollar and depreciation on e
quipment.General and Administrative
 
General and administrative expenses primarily co
nsist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment,employer
 payroll  taxes  on  stock-based  compensation,  legal  expenses,  restructuring,  insurance  premiums  and  professional  fees.  Our  legalexpenses, including those relate
d to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.The
 decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred in 2019related to our global workforce reduction partially offset by charitab
le contributions and employee related costs.The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019
 compared to 2018 was primarily due to severance costs incurred in 2019 relatedto our CEO transition.
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision
 for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from ourmanaged payments services, fraud and
 bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for transactionlosses to fluctuate depending on many factors, includ
ing changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.The
 increase in provision for transaction losses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in customer protection programcosts as a result of increased volume and bad debt expens
e.The increase in provision for transaction losses in 2
019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense. 40

Interest and Other, Net 
Interest
 and  other,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  earned  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  investments,  as  well  as  foreign  exchangetransactio
n gains and losses, gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from Adyen, our portion of operating results frominvestments
 accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  investment  gain/loss  on  acquisitions  or  disposals  and  interest  expense,consisting
 of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interestexpense
 on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. The following table presents interest and other, net (in millions, exceptpercentages):

The
 increase  in  interest  and  other,  net  in  2020  compared  to  2019  was  primarily  attributable  to  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Adyenwarrant, the change in fair value of our investment in Kakao Bank, the absence of a loss recorded in 2019 for the divestiture of brands4frien
ds and again
 recorded for the receipt of proceeds that were held in escrow related to a long-term investment that was sold in 2018. These increases werepartially offset by lower interest income, an impairment recorded on an investment an
d foreign exchange losses.The
 decrease  in  interest  and  other,  net  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  attributable  to  the  gain  recognized  on  the  sale  of  ourinvestment
 in Flipkart of $313 million and the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in Giosis of $266 million that did not occur in2019, the
 loss recorded upon the divestiture of brands4friends of $52 million partially offset by the gain recognized due to the change in fair value ofthe Adyen warrant of $133 million that occurred in 201

The following table presents provisi
on for income taxes (in millions, except percentages): 
Year Ended December 31,  
2020 2019 2018 Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 878 $ 233 $ 121 Effective tax rate
25.7 %   13.3 %   5.4 %The
 increase in our effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to tax rate changes enacted in the fourth quarter whichresulted in
 a net tax charge as our deferred tax assets were remeasured to the new rates. Additionally, our tax rate increased due to the effects of aretroactive
 California law change which resulted in incremental tax on the gain on the sale of StubHub. These impacts were partially offset by areduction in the 2019 effective tax
 rate from the effective settlements of audits, and a benefit due to the enacted New York state legislation regardingthe taxability of foreign earnings.
The
 increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the $463 million reduction in 2018 to the provisional taxamounts
 recorded in 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity methodinvestment
 in Giosis that was not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a current basis that did not recur in 2019 and certain expenses in 2019.These
 impacts were partially offset by a reduction in the 2019 by the effective tax rate from the effective settlements of audits and a benefit due tothe enacted New York state legislation regard
ing the taxability of foreign earnings.41

We are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have beenreserved
 for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given theinherent
 uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing ofthese
 adjustments. However, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. See “Note 16 – Income Taxes” to theconsolidated financial statements inc
luded in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.Discontinued Operations
On November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell our StubHub business. The sale of our
StubHub
 business was completed on February 13, 2020. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, StubHub’s financial results for periods prior to thesale
 have  been  reflected  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  as  discontinued  operations.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilitiesassociated
 with the discontinued operations in the prior periods are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet. See“Note 4 – Discontinued Operations” in our consol
idated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.On
 July 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta for$2.5
 billion  in  cash,  subject  to  certain  adjustments,  and  approximately  540  million  shares  in  Adevinta.  Together,  the  total  consideration  payableunder
 the definitive agreement is valued at approximately $9.2 billion, based on the closing trading price of Adevinta’s outstanding shares on theOslo
 Stock Exchange on July 17, 2020. We believe the transaction will close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Completion of the transaction issubject
 to  certain  conditions,  including  receipt  of  certain  regulatory  approvals,  and  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  general  industry  andeconomic
 conditions outside our control. As a result, we have classified the results of our Classifieds business as discontinued operations in ourconsolidated
 statement  of  income  for  the  periods  presented.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  discontinuedoperations
 are classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. See “Note 4 – Discontinued Operations” in our consolidated financialstatements included elsewhere in this report for additio
nal information.Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  use  FX-Neutral
 net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financialresults.
 We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-yearimpact
 of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excludinghedging activity.
These
 non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  bedifferent
 from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set ofaccounting
 rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results ofoperations
 as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction withthe corresponding GAAP measures.
These
 non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospectsfor
 the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding theforeign
 currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we havehistorically
 reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in ourfinancial reporting.

 provided by continuing operating activities of $2.2 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to net income of $2.5 billion with adjustmentsfor
 income from discontinued operations of $402 million, $635 million in depreciation and amortization, $465 million in stock-based compensationand
 $247  million  in  provision  for  transaction  losses,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  $503  million  in  changes  in  assets  and  liabilities,  net  ofacquisition
 effects, and adjustments of $573 million for gain on investments, $104 million for deferred income taxes and $104 million for changes infair value of the Adyen warrant.
Cash paid for
 income taxes in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $520 million, $270 million and $556 million, respectively. Cash paid for income taxesin
 2018 included tax payments related to our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under U.S. tax reform of $168 million, including aprepayment of $72 million.
Continuing Investing Activities
Cash
 used in investing activities of $219 million in 2020 was primarily attributable to cash paid for purchases of investments of $32.9 billionand property and equipment of $494 milli
on, partially offset by proceeds of $33.1 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.Cash provided by
 investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2019 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $50.5 billion from the maturities and salesof
 investments, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $47.0 billion, property and equipment of $523 million and an equityinvestment in Paytm Mall of $160 million.
Cash provided by
 investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $30.9 billion from the maturities and salesof
 investments and $1.0 billion from the sale of equity investment in Flipkart, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $28.1billion, property and equipment of $62
3 million and acquisitions of $302 million.The
 largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  ourinvestments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase a
nd sale activity will fluctuate.Continuing Financing Activities
Cash used
 in financing activities of $5.7 billion in 2020 was primarily used to repurchase $5.1 billion of common stock, repay outstanding debtof $1.8 billion and pay $447 mil
lion of cash dividends, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuances of $1.8 billion.Cash used
 in financing activities of $7.1 billion in 2019 was primarily used to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock, repay outstanding debtof $1.6 billion and pay $473 mil
lion of cash dividends.Cash
 used in financing activities of $5.4 billion in 2018 was primarily used to repurchase $4.5 billion of common stock and repay $750 millionof our outstanding senior notes.
The
 positive effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollaragainst
 other  currencies,  primarily  the  Korean  won  and  euro,  during  2020.  The  negative  effect  of  exchange  rate  movements  on  cash,  cashequivalents
 and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Korean won, euro and Britishpound during
44

2019. The negative effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S.dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro, Korean wo
n and British pound, during 2018.Stock Repurchases
In
 January 2019, our Board authorized a $4.0 billion stock repurchase program and in January 2020, our Board authorized an additional $5.0billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs hav
e no expiration from the date of authorization.On
 February  13,  2020,  we  entered  into  accelerated  share  repurchase  agreements  (the  “ASR  Agreements”)  with  each  three  financialinstitutions
 (each, an “ASR Counterparty”), as part of our share repurchase program. Under the ASR Agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of$3.0
 billion to the ASR Counterparties and received an initial delivery of approximately 69 million shares of our common stock, which shares wererecorded
 as a $2.55 billion increase to treasury stock. The remaining $450 million was evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to ourown
 stock,  classified  within  stockholders’  equity.  In  July  2020,  the  ASR  Agreements  settled  and  resulted  in  approximately  74  million  sharesrepurchased at an average price per share of $40.77 an
d the forward contract was settled and recorded as an increase to treasury stock.Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject to market
 conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstandingshare
 count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privatelynegotiat
ed transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deemsappropriate and will be funde
d from our working capital or other financing alternatives.During
 2020, we repurchased approximately $5.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31,2020,
 a total of approximately $2.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. InFebruary 2021, our Board authorized an add
itional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.We
 expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  ourcommon
 stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actualnumber
 of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, the impacts of the COVID-19pandemic, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. Dividends
The company paid a total of $447 million a
nd $473 million in cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,respectively. No cash dividends were pa
id in 2018. In February 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock to be paidon March 19, 2021 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2021.

Senior NotesAs
 of December 31, 2020, we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion. The netproceeds
 from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures,share
 repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and afterMarch
 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, at aredemptio
n price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or allof
 the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plusaccrued
 and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable senior notes) occurs with respect to the 3.800%fixed
 rate  notes  due 2022,  the  floating  rate  notes  due 2023,  the  2.750%  fixed  rate  notes  due 2023,  the  1.900%  fixed  rate  notes  due  2025,  the3.600%
 fixed rate notes due 2027, the 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certainexceptions,
 offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaidinterest.
 For  additional details related  to  our senior notes,  please see “Note  11 – Debt”  to the  consolidated  financial statements  included in thisreport.
On
 January 29, 2021, the company announced that it issued a notice of redemption for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of the6.000% senior notes due 2056. The effective date of this redemptio
n will be March 1, 2021.To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterbankOffered
 Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed ratesenior
 notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedgesoutstanding
 as  $1.15  billion  related  to  our  2.200%  senior  notes  of  the  $2.4  billion  aggregate  notional  amount  matured  in  2019  and  in  2019  weterminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% sen
ior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes dueJuly
 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as anincrease to the long-term debt balance and is being recogn
ized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. Thegain
 recognized was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.  For additional details related tothe interest rate swap termination, please see, “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidate
d financial statements included in this report.During 2020,
 we began to hedge the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our floating-rate debt using interest rateswaps.
 These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert our LIBOR-based floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, reducing the impact ofinterest-rate
 changes on future interest expense. The total notional amount of these interest swaps was $400 million as of December 31, 2020 withterms
 calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. Our interest rate swap contracts have maturity dates in2023.
The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith
 respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default with customary grace periods in certain circumstances, includingpayment defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults.
Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof
 up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2020, there were nocommercial paper notes outstanding.
46

Credit AgreementIn
 March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject tothe
 agreement of the applicable lenders, increase commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under thecredit
 agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The credit agreementreplaced our prior $2 billion uns
ecured revolving credit agreement dated November 2015, which was terminated effective March 2020.As
 of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and are required to maintain available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repaycommercial
 paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due, in an aggregateamount
 of $1.5 billion. However, as of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our commercial paper program; therefore, $2billion
 of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. Thecredit
 agreement includes a covenant limiting our consolidated leverage ratio to no more than 4.0:1.0, subject to, upon the occurrence of a qualifiedmaterial
 acquisition, if so elected by us, a step-up to 4.5:1.0 for the four fiscal quarters completed following such qualified material acquisition. Thecredit
 agreement  includes  customary  events  of  default,  with  corresponding  grace  periods  in  certain  circumstances,  including  payment  defaults,cross-defaults
 and bankruptcy-related defaults. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, includingrestrictions regard
ing the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. The credit agreement alsocontains customary representations and warranties. 
We were in compliance with all financi
al covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2020.Credit Ratings
As
 of December 31, 2020, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
 rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  FitchRatings,
 Inc. (long-term  rated BBB, short-term  rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of oursources
 of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actionstaken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as describe
d above, will likely increase our borrowing costs. 47

Commitments and ContingenciesWe
 have  certain  fixed  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  include  future  estimated  payments  for  general  operating  purposes.Changes
 in  our  business  needs,  contractual  cancellation  provisions,  fluctuating  interest  rates,  and  other  factors  may  result  in  actual  paymentsdiffering
 from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes ourfixed contractual obligations and commitments for our continui
ng operations (in millions):Payments Due During the Year Ending December 31,

ation of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•
Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. For additional details related to our debt,please
 see  “Note  11  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report.  This  table  does  not  reflect  any  amountspayable
 under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstandingas of December 31, 2020.
•
Lease amounts include payments for our operating and finance leases for office space, data centers, as well as fulfillment centers andother
 corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and arenot
 expected  to  differ  significantly  from  actual  results  under  our  existing  leases,  unless  a  substantial  change  in  our  headcount  needsrequires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office faci
lity early.•
Purchase  obligation  amounts  include  minimum  purchase  commitments  for  advertising,  capital  expenditures  (computer  equipment,software
 applications,  engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  theordinary course of business.
As
 we  are  unable  to  reasonably  predict  the  timing  of  settlement  of  liabilities  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  net,  the  table  does  notinclude $295 million of such n
on-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The timingof
 the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits couldsignificantly
 change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters beingexamined,
 we are  unable to  estimate  the  full  range of  possible adjustments  to  the balance of gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits.  See “Note  16 –Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report for more information on unrecognized tax benefits.Liquidity and Capital Resou
rce RequirementsAs
 of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term
 non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31,2020,
 this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $3.1 billion. As we repatriate these funds to theU.S.,
 we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the periodwhen such repatriation occurs. We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.
We
 actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety ofprincipal and secondarily o
n improving yield on these assets. We diversify our48

cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterpartiesfail
 or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term
 investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not beimpacted
 by adverse conditions in the financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At anypoint in time we have funds in our operating acco
unts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.We
 believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generatedfrom
 operations,  borrowings  available  under  our  credit  agreement  and  commercial  paper  program,  and  our  access  to  capital  markets,  will  besufficient
 to  fund  our  operating  activities,  anticipated  capital  expenditures,  repayment  of  debt  and  stock  repurchases  for  the  foreseeable  future.However,
 COVID-19 and related measures to contain its impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial markets andeconomies.
 The future impact of COVID-19 and these containment measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowingcosts
 and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and we cannotassure
 that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience otherliquidity issues going forward.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
 of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $5.2 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.9 billionin cash withdrawals, held within the fin
ancial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited
 history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recordedin our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provis
ions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.49

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and EstimatesGeneral
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions thataffect
 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have basedour
 estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich
 form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Oursenior management has discussed the deve
lopment, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
An accounting policy is considered to be
 critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that arehighly
 uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accountingestimates
 that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the followingcritical
 accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.The
 following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financialstatements and related notes and other disclosures incl
uded in this report.Revenue Recognition
We
 may  enter  into  certain  revenue  contracts  that  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  goods  or  services  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 We also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment issometimes
 required  to  determine  the  appropriate  accounting  for  these  transactions  including:  (1)  whether  services  are  considered  distinctperformance
 obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of eachdistinct
 performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as anagent);
 (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized asrevenue
 or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing oramount of revenue recognition.
Income Taxes
Our
 annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions inwhich
 we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.Significant
 judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  tax  expense  and  in  evaluating  our  tax  positions,  including  evaluating  uncertainties  and  thecomplexity
 of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions
 are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome
 tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred
 tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation ofdeemed
 repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at thebalance sheet date.
Deferred
 tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arisebecause
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and taxcredit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverabil
ity of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxableincome
 from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.These
 sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range andlong-range
 business forecasts. As of December 31, 2020, we had a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwardsbased on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realize
d.50

We  recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,pursuant to which we only recognize the tax
 benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination
 by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements fromsuch
 positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimatesettlement.
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.GAAP
 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings inthe quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest an
d penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We
 file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain taxposition
 is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolutionof
 any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, aswell
 as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require theuse of cash.
The following table illustrates our effective tax rates:
 
Year Ended December 31,  
2020  2019  2018 (In millions, except percentages)
Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 878  $233  $121 Effective tax rate
25.7 %  13.3 %  5.4 %Our
 future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutoryrates
 and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  orliabil
ities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examinationof
 our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the ade
quacy of our provision for income taxes.Based
 on  our  results  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  apercentage
 of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $34 million, resulting in anapproximate $0.05 change in dil
uted earnings per share.Goodwill and Intangible As
setsThe
 purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business withthe
 residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgmentsand
 estimates.  These  judgments  can  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cash  flows  that  an  asset  is  expected  to  generate  in  the  future  and  theappropriate weighted average cost of capita
l.As
 of  December  31,  2020,  our  goodwill  totaled  $4.7  billion  and  our  identifiable  intangible  assets,  net  totaled  $12  million.  We  assess  theimpairment of goodwi
ll of our reporting unit annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not berecoverable.
 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikely
 than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment,then the
 reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discountedcash
 flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flowapproach
 uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earningsmultiples
 to value our reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at thereporting unit. We
 conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we determined thatno impairment of the carrying value of
51

goodwill for any reporting units was required. See “Note 5 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in thisreport.
Legal Contingencies
In
 connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, andprovided
 for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of thefacts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are sub
ject to change based upon new information and future events.From
 time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involvedin
 legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  13  –  Commitments  andContingencies”
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims againstus,
 and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could requiresignificant
 amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certainclaims,
 we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting asignificant
 part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk
We
 are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events(including
 volatility  or  distress  in  the  equity  and/or  debt  or  credit  markets)  may  impact  regional  and  global  financial  markets.  These  events  andconditions
 could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from adverse economicconditions and events or changes in i
nterest rates.The
 primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk.To
 achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types, including bankdeposits,
 government bonds and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 31% of our total cash and investments washeld
 in cash and cash equivalents. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, the fair market values of ourfixed
 rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securitiesthat have declined in market value due to chan
ges in interest rates. 
As
 of December 31, 2020, the balance of our corporate debt securities was $2.5 billion, which represented approximately 55% of our totalcash
 and investments. Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. Thefair
 market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securitieswith longer
 maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject toless
 interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and mayalso
 suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations orwe
 may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in interest rates would have resulted in a
 decrease in the fair value of our investments of $5 million and $8 million as of December 31,2020 and 2019, respectively.
As
 of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion of outstanding senior notes, of which 95% bore interest atfixed
 rates.  In  2014,  we  entered  into  $2.4  billion  of  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  had  an  economic  effect  of  modifying  the  fixed  interestobligations associated with $
1.15 billion of our 2.200% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021, and $500million
 of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus aspread.
 In July 2019, $1.15 billion of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured and we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750million
 of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024, which were designated as fair valuehedges.
 As a result of the early termination,  hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as anincrease to the long-term debt balance and is being recogn
ized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. Thegain recognized was immaterial for the years ended D
ecember 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.During 2020,
 we began to hedge the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our floating-rate debt using interest rateswaps.
 These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert our LIBOR-based floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, reducing the impact ofinterest-rate
 changes on future interest expense. The total notional amount of these interest swaps was $400 million as of December 31, 2020 withterms
 calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. Our interest rate swap contracts have maturity dates in2023. At December 31, 2020, we did not have an un
hedged balance on our floating-rate debt.53

During  2020,  we  began  to  hedge  the  variability  of  forecasted  interest  payments  using  forward-starting  interest  rate  swaps.  The  notionalamount
 of these swaps was $700 million as of December 31, 2020, with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interestat a fixed rate.
 These interest rate swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on anticipated debt issuance in 2022, and they will be terminatedupon
 issuance of the debt. When entering into forward-starting interest rate swaps, we are subject to market risk with respect to changes in theunderlying
 benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swaps. We manage market risk by matching theterms
 of the swaps with the terms of the expected debt issuance. We considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determinedthat
 it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1% (100 basispoints) decrease in
 interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our forward-starting and floating to fixed rate interest swapsof approximately $61 million at December 31, 202
0.Further
 changes  in  interest  rates  will  impact  interest  expense  on  any  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facility,  which  bear  interest  atfloating
 rates,  and  the  interest  rate  on  any  commercial  paper  borrowings  we  make  and  any  debt  securities  we  may  issue  in  the  future  and,accordingly,
 will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.
 
Equity Price Risk
Equity Investments
Our equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held compani
es. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a componentof interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounti
ng. Equityinvestments without readily determinable fair valu
es are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable pricechanges obtained from orderly transactions for identical or simil
ar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the equityinvestment are recognized in interest and other, net. As of December 31, 2020, our equ
ity investments totaled $547 million, which representedapproximately 12% of our total cash and investments, and were primarily relate
d to equity investments without readily determinable fair values.Warrant
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrantis
 accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equityvolatility
 may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  value  of  the  warrant.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  a  one  dollar  change  in  Adyen’s  common  stock,holding
 other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrant by approximately $1 million. For additional details related tothe warrant, please see “Note 8 – Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financ
ial statements included in this report.Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily theBritish
 pound, euro, Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. Wetransact
 business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our internationalsubsidiaries
 for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operationsand certain of our
 intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we mayrecord significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuati
ons and related hedging activities.We
 have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  theseexposures
 and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through thepurchase
 of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts isat
 times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 8– Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report.54

We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreigncurrency
 exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.Most
 of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or lossis
 initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the sameperiod
 the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s gainor loss is recognized immediately in earning
s in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cashflow hedge accounting.
The
 following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and net investmenthedges,
 and the before-tax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of December 31,2020.
 The  sensitivity  for  foreign  currency  contracts  is  based  on  a  20%  adverse  change  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  against  relevant  functionalcurrencies.

 our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes inthe value of the underlying exposure.
We
 also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other thanthe
 functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movementson
 our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net, which areoffset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchang
e contracts.We
 considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  inexchange
 rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  onincome before income taxes of
 approximately $52 million as of December 31, 2020 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchangeforwards in place as of December 31, 2020.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockho
lders of eBay Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Cont
rol over Financial ReportingWe
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and therelated
 consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31,
 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2020
 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal controlover
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  ofDecember
 31,  2020  and  2019,  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2020  inconformity
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,effective internal control o
ver financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Int egrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the con
solidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for Opinions
The Company’s
 management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits
 assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our re
sponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates)
 (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rulesand regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial repor
ting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,evidence
 regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weaknessexists,
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performingsuch other procedures as we cons
idered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, o
r disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.59

Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter
 communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired
 to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)
 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe
 consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on thecritical audit matter or on
 the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Income Taxes
As
 described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and inevaluating
 management’s tax positions, relating to evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. As disclosed by management, theCompany’s
 income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to their foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of the Company’s intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred
 tax  benefit  may,  from  time  to  time,  change  based  on  changes  in  tax  rates.  Management  recognizes  and  measures  uncertain  tax  positions  inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,  pursuant  to  which  management  only  recognizes  the  tax  benefit  from  anuncertain
 tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits ofthe position. The total provis
ion for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $878 million, and the effective tax rate was 25.7%.The
 principal considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  income  taxes  is a critical audit  matter  are the  significant  judgmentapplied by management when determin
ing the tax expense and in evaluating management’s tax positions relating to uncertain tax positions and taxes on foreignearnings,
 which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating toincome taxes.
Addressing the matter
 involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.
 These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including controls over uncertain tax positions and theprovision
 for  income  taxes.  These  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  evaluating  tax  positions  taken  by  management,  including  evaluating  thereasonableness
 of management’s determination of the probability of sustaining the position under tax examination, evaluating communications with the relevanttax authorities, testing appl
icable tax rates applied by management, and evaluating the impact of taxes on foreign earnings./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay Inc. is a
 global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one of theworld’s
 largest  and  most  vibrant  marketplaces  for  discovering  great  value  and  unique  selection.  Collectively,  we  connect  millions  of  buyers  andsellers around the
 world, empowering people and creating opportunity for all. Our technologies and services are designed to give buyers choice anda breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sel
lers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. When
 we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation(eBay Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries, un
less otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.On November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell our StubHub business. The sale of our
StubHub
 business was completed on February 13, 2020. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, StubHub’s financial results for periods prior to thesale
 have  been  reflected  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  as  discontinued  operations.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilitiesassociated
 with the discontinued operations in the prior periods are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet. See“Note 4 – Discontinued Operations” for additiona
l information.On
 July 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta for$2.5
 billion  in  cash,  subject  to  certain  adjustments,  and  approximately  540  million  shares  in  Adevinta.  Together,  the  total  consideration  payableunder
 the definitive agreement is valued at approximately $9.2 billion, based on the closing trading price of Adevinta’s outstanding shares on theOslo
 Stock Exchange on July 17, 2020. We believe the transaction will close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Completion of the transaction issubject
 to  certain  conditions,  including  receipt  of  certain  regulatory  approvals,  and  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  general  industry  andeconomic
 conditions outside our control. If the conditions to the closing of the transfer of Classifieds are neither satisfied nor, where permissible,waived
 on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  we  may  be  unable  to  complete  the  transfer  of  Classifieds  or  such  completion  may  be  delayed  beyond  ourexpected
 timeline.  As  a  result  of  entering  into  a  definitive  agreement,  we  have  classified  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  ourClassifieds
 business  as  held  for  sale  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The  results  of  our  Classifieds  business  have  been  presented  asdisconti
nued operations in our consolidated statement of income for all periods presented as the transfer represents a strategic shift in our businessthat has a major effect on our operations and financial results. See “Note 4 – Disc
ontinued Operations” for additional information.During
 the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  classified  the  results  of  our  previously  reported  StubHub  segment  as  discontinued  operations  in  ourconsolidated
 statement of income for all periods presented. In addition, during the third quarter of 2020, we classified the results of our Classifiedssegment
 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income for the periods presented. We have one reportable segment, to reflectthe way
 management and our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) review and assess performance of the business. Our reportable segment isMarketplace,
 which includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Forfurther
 information on our segments, refer to “Note 6 – Segments”. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the currentperiod segment presentation.

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requiresmanagement
 to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets andliabilities at the date of the consolidate
d financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On anongoing
 basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenuerecognition,
 stock-based  compensation,  investments,  goodwill  and  the  recoverability  of  intangible  assets.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historicalexperience
 and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  thoseestimates.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-ownedsubsidiaries
 and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  beeneliminated
 in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidationrequirement
 for VIEs. Investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence,but not
 control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investees’ resultsof operations is included in interest and oth
er, net and our investment balance is included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where wehold less than a 20% ownership interest
 are generally accounted for as equity investments to be measured at fair value or, under an election, at costif
 it does not have readily determinable fair value, in which case the carrying value would be adjusted upon the occurrence of an observable pricechange in an orderly transaction for identical or simil
ar instruments or impairment.Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue recognition
We
 recognize revenue when we transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequentlyremitted to governmental authorities.
Net transaction revenues
Our
 net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers inour
 Marketplace. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise sellers. Our net transactionrevenues are reduced by incentives provid
ed to our customers.We
 identified one performance obligation to sellers on our Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on our secure andtrusted
 Marketplace  platforms.  Final  value  fees  are  recognized  when  an  item  is  sold  on  a  Marketplace  platform,  satisfying  this  performanceobligation.
 There may be additional services available to Marketplace sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings, that are not distinct within thecontext
 of the contract. Accordingly, fees for these additional services are recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promotedlisting fees are recognized when the item is sold a
nd feature and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires.Store
 subscription  and  other  nonstandard  listing  contracts  may  contain  multiple  performance  obligations,  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 Determining  whether  performance  obligations  should  be  accounted  for  separately  or  combined  may  require  significant  judgment.  Thetransaction
 price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). In instances where SSP is not directlyobservable,
 we generally estimate selling prices based on when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography. These estimates aregenerally
 based on pricing strategies, market factors, strategic objectives and observable inputs. Store subscription revenues are recognized overthe
 subscription  period,  and  discounts  offered  through  store  subscription  or  nonstandard  listing  contracts  are  recognized  when  the  options  areexercised or when the options expire.
68

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Further, to
 drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts onitems
 sold,  coupons  and  rewards.  Evaluating  whether  a  promotion  or  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  may  require  significant  judgment.Promotions
 and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue isrecognized
 or when we pay or promise to pay the incentive. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom wehave
 no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, we may provide credits to customers when we refundcertain
 fees.  Credits are accounted for as variable consideration  at contract  inception when estimating  the amount of revenue to be recognizedwhen
 a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of  revenue  will  not  occur  and  updated  asadditional information
 becomes available.Marketing services and other revenues
Our
 marketing  services  and other  revenues  are derived principally  from  the sale of advertisements,  classifieds  fees,  and revenue sharingarrangements.
 Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on “impressions” (i.e., the numberof times that an
 advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platformsclick
 through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) delivered to advertisers. We use the output method and apply the practicalexpedient to recognize advertising reve
nue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising commitments withrebates, estimated pay
out is accounted for as a variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.Revenues related to
 revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on whether we are the principal and are responsible for fulfilling thepromise
 to  provide the specified  services  or whether  we are  an agent arranging  for  those services  to  be provided by our  partners.  Determiningwhether
 we are a principal or agent in these contracts may require significant judgment. If we are the principal, we recognize revenue in the grossamount of consideration received from the
 customer, whereas if we are an agent, we recognize revenue net of the consideration due to our partnersat
 a point in time when the services are provided. Our most significant revenue share arrangements are with shipping service providers. We areprimarily acting as an
 agent in these contracts and revenues are recognized at a point in time when we have satisfied our promise of connecting theshipping service provider to our customer.
Contract balances  
Timing
 of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers.  Accounts receivable represents amounts invoiced andrevenue
 recognized  prior  to  invoicing  when  we  have  satisfied  our  performance  obligation  and  have  the  unconditional  right  to  payment.  Theallowance
 for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience,the
 age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances,  current  economic  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  our  customers’  ability  to  pay.  Theallowance
 for  doubtful  accounts  and  authorized  credits  was  $136  million  and  $110  million  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,respectively.
Deferred revenue
 consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally short-term
 duration  of  contracts,  the  majority  of  the  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  in  the  following  reporting  period.  The  amount  of  revenuerecognized
 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was$78
 million. The amount of revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balanceat the beginning of the period was $65 mil
lion.Internal use software and platform development costs
Direct
 costs incurred to develop software for internal use and platform development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimateduseful
 life of one  to five years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized costs, primarily related to labor and stock-based
 compensation, of $129 million and $137 million, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $139 million, $150 millionand
 $160  million  for  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platformdevelopment are expensed as incurred.
69

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Advertising expense
We
 expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements inthe
 period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses arerecognized based on the terms of
 the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions deliveredover
 the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertisingexpense totaled $1.2 billio
n, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Stock-based compensation
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), total shareholderreturn
 performance stock units (“TSR PSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units, and performance share units, to our directors, officers andemployee
s. We primarily issue RSUs. We determine compensation expense associated with RSUs based on the fair value of our common stock onthe date of grant. We determine compensation expense associate
d with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using theBlack-Scholes valuation mode
l. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vestingperiod
 for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been reducedfor
 estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. Werecognize
 a  benefit  or  provision  from  stock-based  compensation  in  earnings  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  to  the  extent  that  anincremental tax benefit or deficiency is realized by foll
owing the ordering provisions of the tax law.Provision for transaction losses
Provision
 for  transaction  losses  consists  primarily  of  losses  resulting  from  our  buyer  protection  programs,  payment  misuse  includingchargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant relate
d chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services and account takeovers.Provision
 for transaction losses represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience and many other factors includingchanges to our protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as ec
onomic conditions such as COVID-19.Provision for credit losses
Provision
 for  credit  losses  consist  of  bad  debt  expense  associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  These  losses  are  recorded  inprovision for transaction losses in our consolid
ated statement of income.We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our receivables from sellers or advertisers. We develop estimates to reflect the risk
 of creditloss
 which are based on historical loss trends adjusted for asset specific attributes, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts ofthe
 economic conditions that will exist through the contractual life of the financial asset. Our receivables are recovered over a period of 0-180 days,therefore,
 forecasted changes to economic conditions are not expected to have a significant effect on the estimate of the allowance for doubtfulaccounts,
 except in extraordinary circumstances. We write off the asset when it is no longer deemed collectible or when it goes past due 180 dayswhichever
 is  earlier,  with  certain  limited  exceptions.  We  monitor  our  ongoing  credit  exposure  through  an  active  review  of  collection  trends.  Ouractivities
 include monitoring the timeliness of payment collection, managing dispute resolution and performing timely account reconciliations. Wemay employ collection agencies to pursue recov
ery of defaulted receivables.Customer accounts and funds receivable
These
 balances  are  either  held  by  financial  institutions  associated  with  payment  intermediation  activity  and  awaiting  settlement,  or  areinstallment collections from financial institutio
ns.70

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 are exposed to credit losses from customer accounts and funds receivable balances held by third party financial institutions. We assessthese
 balances for credit loss based on a review of the average period for which the funds are held, credit ratings of the financial institutions and byassessing the probability of default and l
oss given default models. At December 31, 2020 , we did not record any credit-related loss. Income taxes
Significant
 judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and thecomplexity
 of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions
 are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome
 tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. 
We
 account  for  income  taxes  using an  asset  and liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  thecurrent
 year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statementsor
 tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of futurechanges in
 tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefitsthat are not expected to be realized based on avai
lable evidence.We
 report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Werecognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unreco
gnized tax benefits in income tax expense.Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
Cash
 and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, whichmay include bank deposits, U.S. Treasury securities, time deposits, and certificates of dep
osit.We
 consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Our restricted cash balance is primarily comprised ofcash on deposit with banks restricted to safeguard seller pay
ables.Investments
Short-term investments are
 investments with original maturities of less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-sale andare
 reported  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method.  Short-term  investments  are  primarily  comprised  of  corporate  debt  securities,commercial paper, and
 agency securities. Long-term investments are primarily comprised of corporate debt securities, agency securities, and equityinvestments.
 Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealizedgains
 and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income(loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or benefits.
Our
 equity  investments  are  non-marketable  equity  securities,  which  are  investments  in  privately-held  companies.  We  account  for  equityinvestments
 through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Our consolidatedresults
 of operations include, as a component of interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted forunder the equity method of
 accounting. Our share of investees’ results of operations is not material for any period presented. Our equity investmentsfor
 which we do not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, thecarrying
 value is measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactionsfor
 the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Such changes in the basis of the equity investment are recognized in interest and other,net.
71

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 perform  a  qualitative  impairment  assessment  on  a  quarterly  basis  over  our  equity  investments.  Equity  investments  without  readilydetermina
ble fair value are considered impaired when there is an indication that the fair value of our interest is less than the carrying amount. Equitymethod
 investments are considered impaired when there is an indication of an other-than-temporary decline in value below the carrying amount.Impairments of equity investments are recorded in interest and other, net.
We
 periodically assess our portfolio of debt investments for impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessmentfirst
 takes  into  account  our  intent  to  sell,  or  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  we  will  be  required  to  sell  the  security  before  recovery  of  itsamortized
 cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through interest andother, net. For
 debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we assess whether the decline in fair valuehas
 resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost,any
 changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Ifthis
 assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared tothe
 amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a creditloss
 exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through interest and other, net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less thanthe
 amortized  cost  basis.  Any  additional  impairment  not  recorded  through  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensiveincome.
 Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged againstthe
 allowance when management believes the uncollectability of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regardingintent or requirement to sell is met. These changes are recorded in interest & other, net
Leases
At
 the beginning of the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases .  We determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains alease
 at inception. Operating and finance lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discountedusing the discount rate for
 the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for our operating leases,we
 generally use an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of futurelease
 payments.  Operating  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  assets  and  finance  lease  assets  are  generally  recognized  based  on  the  amount  of  the  initialmeasurement of the lease liability. Our leases have
 remaining lease terms of up to ten years, some of which include options to extend the leases forup
 to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the
 lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for our data center leases. Lease and non-leasecomponents for all other leases are accounted for separately.
Operating
 leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidatedbalance
 sheets.  Finance  leases  are  included  in  property  and  equipment,  net,  short-term  debt,  and  long-term  debt  on  our  consolidated  balancesheet.
Property and equipment
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation  for  equipment,  buildings  and  leaseholdimprovements
 commences once they are ready for our intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful
 lives  of  the  assets,  generally, one  to  three  years  for  computer  equipment  and  software,  up  to  thirty  years  for  buildings  and  buildingimprovement
s, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and three years for furniture, fixtures and vehicles. Landis not depreciated.

Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
 is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed todetermine
 whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not passthe qualitative assessment, then the 
reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated usingincome
 and market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discountedcash
 flow  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach,  uses  expected  future  operating  results  and  a  market  participant  discount  rate.  The  marketapproach
 uses  comparable  company  prices  and  other  relevant  information  generated  by  market  transactions  (either  publicly  traded  entities  ormergers
 and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of our reporting unit. Failure toachieve
 these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reportingunit.
 We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2020 and 2019 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying valueof goodwill for any reporting unit was required. 
Intangible
 assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,including
 patents and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line methodand estimated useful lives ranging from 
one  to five years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assets
We
 evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that thecarrying
 amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscountedfuture
 net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 2020, the impairment recorded was immaterial. In 2019 and 2018, no impairment wasrecorded.
Foreign currency
Most
 of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  local  currency  of  their  respective  countries  as  their  functional  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  aretranslated
 into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  averageexchange
 rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component ofaccumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest an
d other, net.Derivative instruments
We
 use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, options and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.We
 may also use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Wedo not use derivative financial instruments for trading purpos
es. We
 also  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  addition  to  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrantis accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 81
5, Derivatives and Hedging . See “Note 8 – Derivative Instruments” for a full description of our derivative instrument activities and relate
d accounting policies.73

Concentration of credit risk
Our
 cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash andcash
 equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived fromrevenue earned
 from customers. In each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of netrevenues.
 Our  derivative  instruments  expose  us  to  credit  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  counterparties  may  be  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  theagreements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In
 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance that requires credit losses on financial assets measured atamortized
 cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, not based on incurred losses. Further, credit losses on available-for-sale
 debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost.This
 standard  impacts  the  Company’s  accounting  for  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts,  available-for-sale  securities  and  other  assets  subject  tocredit
 risk. In preparation for the adoption of this standard, we have updated our credit loss models as needed. The standard is effective for fiscalyears,
 and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 withno material impact on our consolidated financ
ial statements.In
 2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  removing  the  requirement  to  perform  ahypothetical
 purchase price allocation to compute the implied fair value of goodwill to measure impairment. Instead, any goodwill impairment willequal
 the  amount  by  which  a  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  not  to  exceed  the  carrying  amount  of  goodwill.  Further,  theguidance
 eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if itfails
 that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairmenttest
 in  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2019.  We  adopted  this  guidance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  with  no  material  impact  on  ourconsolidated financial statements.
In
 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloudcomputing
 arrangement that is hosted by the vendor (i.e., a service contract). Under the new guidance, customers will apply the same criteria forcapitalizing
 implementation  costs  as  they  would  for  an  arrangement  that  has  a  software  license.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reportingperiods
 beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this guidance prospectively inthe first quarter of 2020 with no material impact on our consolidated financ
ial statements.In
 2018,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  clarify  the  interaction  between  Collaborative  Arrangements  and  Revenue  from  Contracts  withCustomers
 standards. The guidance (1) clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted forunder
 revenue guidance; (2) adds unit of account guidance to the collaborative arrangement guidance to align with the revenue standard; and (3)clarifies
 presentation guidance for transactions with a collaborative arrangement participant that is not accounted for under the revenue standard.The
 guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those annualreporting periods. We adopted this guidanc
e in the first quarter of 2020 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principlesand
 also simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition ofenactment
 of tax laws or rate changes. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, includinginterim
 reporting periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.

 years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.
Note 2 – Net Income Per Share
Basic
 net  income  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  sharesoutstanding
 during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number ofshares
 of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and equityincentive
 awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income pershare excludes all anti-dilutive common sh

 restricted cash balance is primarily comprised of cash on deposit with banks restricted to safeguard seller payables. Our fixed-incomeinvestments
 consist of predominantly investment grade corporate debt securities and government and agency securities. The corporate debt andgovernment and age
ncy securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on their credit ratings from the major rating agencies.The
 longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interestrates
 increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  tochanges
 in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitativeand
 quantitative criteria. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other comprehensive income.Where
 there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings witha
 corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. We presently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized lossposition and expect to realize the full valu
e of all these investments upon maturity or sale.We
 regularly review investment securities for credit impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In making this assessment, weconsider
 the  extent  to  which  fair  value  is  less  than  amortized  cost,  any  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  by  a  rating  agency,  any  adverseconditions
 specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cashflows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected
to
 be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through interest andother,
 net  for  the  credit  loss,  limited  by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.  Any  impairment  that  has  not  beenrecorded
 through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. We did not recognize any credit-related impairmentthrough an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 20

Note 8 – Derivative Instruments
Our
 primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currencyexchange
 rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate andinterest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We
 use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  andliabilities,
 including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration, butwith
 maturities up to 24 months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cashflows
 are  not  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  ourforeign exchange contracts designated as cas
h flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis.During
 2020, we began to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuance using forward-starting interestrate
 swaps. The total notional amount of these forward-starting interest rate swaps was $700 million as of December 31, 2020 with terms calling forus
 to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. These interest rate swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate andhave
 the economic effect of hedging the variability of forecasted interest payments for up to 10 years on an anticipated debt issuance in 2022, andthey will be terminated upon issuance of
 the debt. Similar to other cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of these interest rate swapsin
 accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  the  anticipated  debt  issuance.  Upon  debt  issuance  and  termination  of  the  derivativeinstruments, their fair value will be amortized over the term of the new
 debt to interest expense. We evaluate the effectiveness of interest rate swapsdesignated as cash flow hedges o
n a quarterly basis.During 2020,
 we began to hedge the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our floating-rate debt using interest rateswaps.
 These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert our floating-rate debt that is based on London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) toa
 fixed-rate basis, reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense. The total notional amount of these interest swaps was$400
 million as of December 31, 2020 with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. Our interestrate
 swap contracts have maturity dates in 2023. Similar to other cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of these interest rate swapsin accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) an
d their fair value will be amortized over the term of the debt to interest expense.We
 used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.These
 interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion of these notes so that theinterest
 payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a spread. These interest rate swaps were terminated in2019.

Cash Flow Hedges
For
 derivative  instruments  that  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially  reported  as  a  component  ofaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  income  (“AOCI”)  and  subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  hedgedtransaction
 affects  earnings.  Derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  must  be  de-designated  as  hedges  when  it  is  probable  theforecasted hedg
ed transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains andlosses in AOCI associated with such derivati
ve instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings.  As of December 31, 2020, we have estimatedthat
 approximately $73 million of net derivative loss related to our foreign exchange cash flow hedges and $1 million of net derivative loss related toour interest rate
 cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.We classify cash flows related to our cash flow hedges as operatin
g activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.Net Investment Hedges
For
 derivative instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in the translationadjustments
 component  of  AOCI  and  is  reclassified  to  net  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  the  hedged  subsidiary  is  either  sold  or  substantiallyliquidated.
Fair Value Hedges
We
 designated the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019,2021
 and 2024 as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for them as fair value hedges. These transactions were designated as fair valuehedges
 for financial accounting purposes because they protected us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due tobenchmark
 interest  rate  movements.  In  2019,  $1.15  billion  related  to  our  2.200%  senior  notes  due  2019  of  the  $2.4  billion  aggregate  notionalamount
 matured. In addition, during 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021and
 $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectivelyand
 the  gain  on  termination  was  recorded  as  an  increase  to  the  long-term  debt  balance  and  is  being  recognized  over  the  remaining  life  of  theunderlyi
ng debt as a reduction to interest expense. The gain recognized was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31,2019
.Non-Designated Hedges
Our
 derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetaryassets
 or  liabilities,  including  intercompany  balances  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies.  The  gains  and  losses  on  our  derivatives  notdesignated
 as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other,  net, which are offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the relatedassets
 and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net. We classify cash flows related to our non-designated hedging instruments asoperating activities in our consolid
ated statement of cash flows.Warrant
We
 entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  conjunction  with  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warranthas
 a term of seven years and will vest in a series of four tranches, at a specified price per share (fixed for the first two tranches) upon meetingprocessing
 volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. If and when a relevant milestone is reached, the warrant becomes exercisable withrespect
 to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranchesthat can vest in one calendar year is two.
 
The
 warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .  We report the warrant at fair value within warrantasset
 in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in interest and other, net in our consolidatedstatement
 of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of the warrant, which was recorded as a deferred credit, is reported withinother liabilities in our consoli
dated balance sheets and will be amortized over the life of the commercial arrangement.85

Notional Amounts of Derivative Contracts
Derivative
 transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, whenviewed
 in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only asthe
 basis  on  which  the  value  of  foreign  exchange  payments  under  these  contracts  are  determined.  The  following  table  provides  the  notionalamounts of our outstanding derivatives (in millions):

$ 6,566 $ 4,459 Credit Risk
Our derivatives
 expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek tomitigate
 such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of losswith
 any one counterparty  resulting  from  this type of credit  risk  is monitored  on an ongoing basis.  To further  limit  credit  risk,  we also enter  intocollateral
 security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fairvalue
 of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgradeby either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral rel
ated to our foreign exchange derivative transactions.Note 9 – Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities

 majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputswhere
 applicable, such as equity prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates. Our warrant, which is accounted for as aderivative
 instrument,  is  valued  using  a  Black-Scholes  model.  Key  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  include  risk-free  interest  rates;  Adyen’scommon
 stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding; exercise price; and details specific to the warrant. The value is also probabilityadjusted for management’s assumptions with respect to vesting of the four tranches whic

Senior NotesIn
 March 2020, we issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. The issuance consisted of$500 million of 1.900% fixed rate notes due 20
25 and $500 million of 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030.In June 2020, $500 million of our 2.150% sen
ior fixed rate notes matured and were repaid.In
 June 2020, we also issued additional senior unsecured notes in a reopening of our outstanding 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025 and2.700%
 fixed  rate  notes  due  2030 that  were  issued  in  March  2020  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $750  million.  The  June  2020  issuanceconsisted
 of $300 million of additional 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025 and $450 million of additional 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030. We useda
 portion of these proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase any and all of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.875% seniorfixed
 rate notes due in 2021. We settled tender offers with holders of approximately 44% of the total outstanding principal amount of the 2.875%senior
 fixed rate notes due in 2021. Total cash consideration paid for these purchases was $339 million and the total carrying amount of the noteswas
 $329 million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $10 million (including an immaterial amount of fees and other costs associated with thetender),
 which was recorded in interest and other, net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we paid any accrued interest on thetendered notes up to, but
 not including, the date of settlement. In July 2020, we paid $2 million to purchase additional 2.875% senior notes due 2021upon
 final settlement of the tender offer initiated in June 2020. During August 2020, we redeemed the remaining $419 million outstanding principalbalance
 of 2.875% senior notes due 2021. Total cash consideration paid was $430 million, which included the total carrying amount of the notes of$419
 million and $11 million of premium which was recorded in interest and other, net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we paidaccrued interest up to the settlement date.
In
 July 2020, we exercised our option to redeem in whole the 3.250% senior fixed rate notes due in 2020 at a price equal to 100% of theprincipal amount of $500 million, pl
us accrued interest.On
 January 29, 2021, the company announced that it issued a notice of redemption for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of the6.000% senior notes due 2056. The effective date of this redemptio
n will be March 1, 2021.In 2019, $400 million of floating rate notes and $
1.15 billion of 2.200% fixed rate notes matured and were repaid.None of
 the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixedrate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior
 to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notesto be redeemed, plus accrued and unpai
d interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from timeto time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and un
paid interest.If
 a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable senior notes) occurs with respect to the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022,the
 floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due2027, the
 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase allof the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 10
1% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith
 respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default with customary grace periods in certain circumstances, includingpayment defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults.
To
 help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we enteredinto
 interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread.These
 swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes ininterest rates. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair val
ue of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the92

fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in market interest rates. In 2019, $1.15 billion related to our2.200%
 senior notes of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured. In addition, during 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps relatedto
 $750 million  of  our  2.875% senior  notes  due July  2021 and $500 million  of  our 3.450%  senior  notes due July  2024. As a result  of the  earlytermination,
 hedge  accounting  was  discontinued  prospectively  and  the  gain  on  termination  was  recorded  as  an  increase  to  the  long-term  debtbalance
 and  is  being  recognized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  underlying  debt  as  a  reduction  to  interest  expense.  The  gain  recognized  wasimmaterial during the years ended December 31, 202
0 and December 31, 2019. To
 help  achieve  our  interest  rate  risk  management  objectives,  during  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  entered  into  interest  rate  swapagreements
 that effectively converted $400 million of our LIBOR-based floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. These swaps were designated ascash flow hedges and have maturity dates in 202
3.The
 effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization ofany
 original issue discount and premium on these senior notes. Interest on these senior notes is payable either quarterly or semiannually. Interestexpense
 associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and2018
 was approximately $284 million, $301 million and $318 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value ofthese senior notes, using Level 2 inputs, was ap
proximately $8.3 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof
 up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there wereno commercial paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In
 March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject tothe
 agreement of the applicable lenders, increase commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under thecredit
 agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The credit agreementreplaced our prior $2 billion uns
ecured revolving credit agreement dated November 2015, which was terminated effective March 2020.As
 of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in orderto
 repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due, in anaggregate
 amount  of  $1.5  billion.  However  as  of  December  31,  2020,  no  borrowings  were  outstanding  under  our  commercial  paper  program;therefore,
 $2 billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement, subject to customary conditions toborrowing.
 The  credit  agreement  includes  a  covenant  limiting  our  consolidated  leverage  ratio  to  no  more  than  4.0:1.0,  subject  to,  upon  theoccurrence
 of a qualified material acquisition, if so elected by us, a step-up to 4.5:1.0 for the four fiscal quarters completed following such qualifiedmaterial
 acquisition.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  events  of  default,  with  corresponding  grace  periods  in  certain  circumstances,including
 payment defaults, cross-defaults  and bankruptcy-related  defaults. In  addition,  the  credit  agreement  contains  customary  affirmative  andnegative
 covenants,  including  restrictions  regarding  the  incurrence  of  liens  and  subsidiary  indebtedness,  in  each  case,  subject  to  customaryexceptions. The credit agreement also contains customary representati
ons and warranties. We were in compliance with all financi
al covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2020.93

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
 of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $5.2 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.9 billionin cash withdrawals, held within the fin
ancial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Litigation and Other Legal Matters
 
Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate of the reasonably possible loss or
 range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of lossesarising
 directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve months endedDecember
 31, 2020. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently availableinformation,
 that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  orsettlement)
 in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable andsubject
 to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’sexpectations,
 the  impact  on  our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  material.  Legal  fees  are  expensed  asincurred.
General Matte
rsThird
 parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Weare subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be sub
ject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our businessas
 our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/oragainst
 our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposureto
 such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past beenforced
 to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, theLanham Act and the

 Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the range of productsand
 services that we offer and our geographical operations) and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect tothe
 potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that wehave
 violated  patent,  copyright  or  trademark  laws  will  be  filed  against  us.  Intellectual  property  claims,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  are  timeconsuming
 and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter intocostly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorabl
e terms.From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules,
 policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,prices,
 rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  andregulatory
 landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products andservices
 that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatoryactions
 against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages forcertain
 causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significa
nt amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significantoperational resources or otherwise harm our business.
Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,
 we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnifiedparty
 in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent thatsuch
 marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  forintellectual
 property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  ourlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the un
ique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.To
 date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant,either individually or
 collectively. Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
We
 are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the numberof
 shares included within each series; to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any relatedqualifications,
 limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of aseries
 then outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 10 million shares of$0.001 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and n

Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issu
e 3.6 billion shares of common stock.Stock Repurchase Programs
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject to market
 conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstandingshare
 count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privatelynegotiat
ed transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deemsappropri
ate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminatedat
 any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate andregulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. In
 January 2019, our Board authorized a $4.0 billion stock repurchase program and in January 2020 our Board authorized an additional $5.0billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs hav
e no expiration from the date of authorization.On
 February  13,  2020,  we  entered  into  accelerated  share  repurchase  agreements  (the  “ASR  Agreements”)  with  each  of  three  financialinstitutions
 (each an “ASR Counterparty”), as part of our share repurchase program. Under the ASR Agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of$3.0
 billion to the ASR Counterparties and received an initial delivery of approximately 69 million shares of our common stock, which shares wererecorded
 as a $2.55 billion increase to treasury stock. The remaining $450 million was evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to ourown
 stock,  classified  within  stockholders’  equity.  In  July  2020,  the  ASR  Agreements  settled  and  resulted  in  approximately  74  million  sharesrepurchased at an average price per share of $40.77 an
d the forward contract was settled and recorded as an increase to treasury stock.The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during 202

Note 15 – Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Incentive Plans
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards,  performance  share  units  and  total  shareholder  return  performance  share  units(“TSR
 PSUs”), to our directors, officers and employees. As of December 31, 2020, 755 million shares were authorized under our equity incentiveplans and 46 million shares were av
ailable for future grant.Stock
 options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the date of grant forgrants to
 new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and generally expire seven  to  ten years from the dateof
 grant. RSU awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over a periodof 
three to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do n ot have an expiration date.In
 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain executives were eligible to receive PBRSUs. PBRSU awards are subject to performance and time-basedvesting
 requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measuredagainst the
 performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Generally, if the performancecriteria are satisfied, one-
half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the other half of the award vests in Marchof the following year.
During
 2020, our Chief Executive  Officer  was granted  TSR PSUs with performance  and time-based  vesting  requirements.  The number  ofstock
 units  ultimately  received  will  depend  on  our  total  shareholder  return  relative  to  that  of  the  S&P  500  index  over two  and  three  yearmeasurement
 periods. The target number of shares will be divided into two tranches, with each tranche corresponding to 50% of the target shares.The first tranche will vest in full on the second anniversary of the grant date and sec
ond tranche will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.Deferred Stock Units
Prior
 to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  ourannual
 meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to anew
 non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter. Inaddition,
 directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwisebe
 payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date ofgrant.

1,176  $1,625 As
 of December 31, 2020, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $10million,
 $52 million and $315 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations underSection
 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards willbegin to expire in 2021 and 20
23, respectively. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $5 million donot
 expire and $310 million are subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, state tax credit carryforwardsfor income tax purposes were approximately $161 milli
on. Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.As
 of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarilyto operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictio
ns and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized.We
 recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest theunremitted
 earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of the balance sheet date. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $791 million and$884
 million, respectively, of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in other liabilities on our consolidated balancesheet.
 We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated tounremitted
 earnings. With the exception of our Classifieds entities recognized in discontinued operations, these basis differences will be indefinitelyreinvested.
 A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis difference is not practicable.In
 connection  with  the  intent  to  sell  the  Classifieds  business  as  discussed  in  “Note  1  –  The  Company  and  Summary  of  Significant  AccountingPolicies”,
 we assessed the outside basis differences relating to Classifieds and determined that no material deferred taxes need to be provided onthe difference as of December 31, 2020.

 within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $420 million as of December 31, 2020 is $50 million of unrecognized taxbenefits
 indemnified by PayPal. If total unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $295 million. Ofthis amount, approximately $47 million of
 unrecognized tax benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reduced upona
 future  realization.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  our  liabilities  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were  included  in  other  liabilities  on  our  consolidatedbalance sheet.
We
 recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2020, a $10 million benefit was included intax
 expense for interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $39million
 and $46 million, respectively. 
We
 are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  bycertain
 tax  authorities  for  the  2010  to  2019  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  mayultimately
 result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for taxyears after 2009 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and Californ
ia), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
Although
 the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  grossunrecognized
 tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examinationand
 the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognizedtax benefits.
 
On
 July 27, 2015, in Altera  Corp. v. Commissioner,  the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatmentof
 stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. On June 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to issuea writ of certiorari, thus leaving the Ninth Circuit’s ruling intact. There is no impact to our consol

 (such debt, “Outstanding  Classifieds Indebtedness”),  then (A) a portion of the amount otherwise constituting the ClassifiedsDutchCo Cash Distribution equal to
 the aggregate principal amount of such Outstanding Classifieds Indebtedness shall be paid to therelevant

    (i)  With  respect  to  the  portion  of  the  Debt  Financing  or  Replacement  Financing  representing  the  ClassifiedsIndebtedness (or any refinancing thereof), Purchaser represents and w
arrants that:a.
any  transactions occurring after the Closing related to the integration of the Contribution Entities, on the one hand, andPurchaser
 and its Subsidiaries (other than the Contribution Entities), on the other hand, are for the primary purpose of realizingsynergies
 and cost savings and not for the purpose of ensuring that payments in respect of interest or principal in respect of suchportion
 of such Debt Financing or Replacement Financing can be made by the Contribution Entities (such transactions “Permitted Transactions
”); b.
Purchaser  intends  to  cause  payments  of  interest  or  principal  in  respect  of  such  portion  of  the  Debt  Financing  orReplacement Financing to be made so

 Financing, and (z) facilitate the realization of synergies by Purchaser, and, based on the information contained in theBanker
 Letters, Purchaser believes such guarantees or other forms of credit support are not necessary to enable a borrowing byClassifieds
 DutchCo of an amount equal to the Classifieds Indebtedness. In the experience of Purchaser, such guarantees or otherforms of credit support are customary for similar lending arrangements involving subsid
iaries of affiliated groups;d.
Purchaser  has  no  plan  or  intention  to  (I)  make  or  cause  any  of  its  Affiliates  to  make,  any  (x)  payment  of  interest  orprincipal on such portion of such Debt

 in clause (C) above, provide or cause any of its Affiliates to provide any guarantee or other credit support for such portionof
 such Debt Financing or Replacement Financing, (III) assume or cause any of its Affiliates to assume any portion of such DebtFinancing
 or Replacement Financing prior to the repayment thereof in accordance with its terms, or (IV) transfer or cause any of itsAffiliates to transfer any material assets to any of the Contribution Entities (other than pursuant to Permitted Transactions).
