Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. W e develop and distribute content and
services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"), and mobile devices. The terms "Activision
Blizzard," the "Company ," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
        The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. W e are the result of the 2008
business combination (the "Business Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), V ivendi S.A. ("V ivendi"), and V ivendi
Games, Inc. ("V ivendi Games"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of V ivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination,
Activision, Inc., was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
        The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "A TVI."
The King Acquisition
        On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ("King"), by
purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"). W e made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King's
3
Table of Contents
highly complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as
positioning us for future growth. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion was funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash
from new debt issued by the Company . King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategy and V ision
        Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and
services and other media that deliver year -round, highly satisfying and engaging entertainment experiences. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic
pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.
        Expanding audience r each.     Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core of our
business. Our employees, technology , and institutionalized processes allow us to continue to deliver high-quality content that expands our reach. We endeavor to
reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow
consumers to play games with no up-front cost but are instead monetized through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in
other types of media based on our franchises.
        Driving deep consumer engagement.     Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with
our franchises. W e design our games and other forms of media to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers playing and engaged for a long period of time
following a game's release, delivering value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.
        Pr oviding mor e opportunities for player investment.     Increasingly , our consumers engage in our content year -round and are connected to our games online
through mobile devices, connected consoles, and PCs. This allows us to of fer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to the consumers. In
addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental "in-game" content
(including lar ger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be recurring and have higher profit
margins. Further , if executed properly , additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players.
In addition, we believe there is an opportunity for advertising within certain of our franchises, as well as opportunities to drive new forms of player investment
through esports, film and television, and consumer products. W e are in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.
        Our strategy is ultimately aimed at creating shareholder value and enhancing returns. W e strive to increase profitability , cash flows, and return on capital—
and to do so while keeping our company a great place to work for our employees.
Reportable Segments
        Based on our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments as follows:
(i)    Activision Publishing, Inc.
        Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision"), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly
in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game
4
Table of Contents
purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells
products which are principally based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally , we have established a
long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny .
        Activision's key product franchises include: Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny , an online universe of first-
person action gameplay (which we call a "shared-world shooter") for console platforms; and Skylanders®, a kid's game franchise that brings physical toys to life
digitally in the game primarily for console platforms. Call of Duty , Activision's leading franchise, was the number one console franchise globally in 2016, and in
North America for the 8th year in a row , according to The NPD Group, GfK Chart-T rack, and our internal estimates.
(ii)   Blizzar d Entertainment, Inc.
        Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly
in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases,
as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming
service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user -generated content
for Blizzard's games.
        Blizzard's key product franchises include: W orld of W arcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game ("MMORPG") for the
PC; StarCraft®, a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible
card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm®, a free-to-play team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch®, a team-based first person
shooter for the PC and console platforms. W orld of W arcraft is the leading subscription-based MMORPG and was initially launched in November 2004.
(iii)  King Digital Entertainment
        King Digital Entertainment ("King") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile
platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's
games are free-to-play , however players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency .
        King's key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features "match three" games; Farm
Heroes™, which also features "match three" games; Pet Rescue™, which is a "clicker" game; and Bubble W itch™, which features "bubble shooter" games. King
had two of the top 10 highest-grossing titles in the United States of America ("U.S.") mobile app stores for the last thirteen quarters in a row , according to App
Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for Apple App Store and Google Play Store combined.
(iv)  Other
        We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
• The Major League Gaming ("MLG") business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or Media Networks), which
is devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming ef forts by creating ways to deliver a best-in-class fan experience across games,
platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content.
5
Table of Contents
• The Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of
globally recognized intellectual properties, and, in October 2016, released the first season of the animated TV series Skylanders™ Academy  on
Netflix. 
• The Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.
Products
        We develop content and services principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games through retail and digital distribution
channels. W e develop products spanning various genres, including first-person shooter , action/adventure, role-playing, strategy , and "match three," among others.
We primarily of fer the following products and services:
• Full-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC. 
• Downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game. 
• Microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay , generally at
relatively low price points. 
• Subscriptions for players in our W orld of W arcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content.
        Providing additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more
recurring and year -round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly , it allows us to increase player engagement as it provides more frequent and
incremental content for our players.
Product Development and Support
        We focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. W e build content with the potential
for broad reach, sustainable engagement and year -round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for sequels,
prequels and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. W e believe that the development and distribution of products
and content based on proven franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. W e intend to
continue development of owned franchises in the future.
        We develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, production, and technical professionals, including designers, producers,
programmers, artists, and sound engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire
development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. W e believe this model
allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.
        While most of the content for our franchises is developed by internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on
our behalf. From time to time, Activision also acquires the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created
by third-party developers. Since 2010, Activision has been in a long-term exclusive relationship with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including Halo,
Myth and
6
Table of Contents
Marathon, to publish games in the Destiny franchise. During the term of the agreement, Activision has exclusive, worldwide rights to publish and distribute on
multiple platforms all future Bungie games based on Destiny .
        We provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review , assess, and provide support to products throughout the
development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. W e subject all such content
to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and
other defects found in the products. T o support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players through various means, primarily online and by
telephone.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
        Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly . This provides a significant marketing tool that allows us to
communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends.
Our marketing ef forts also include activities on Facebook, T witter , YouTube and other online social networks, other online advertising, other public relations
activity , print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in
cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or the digital
online services provided by our partners. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products
related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional ef forts.
        Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers
(e.g., Target, W al-Mart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores
(e.g., Amazon, T oys "R" Us) or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements.
        Most of our products and content are also available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience
directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.
("Sony"), Nintendo Co., Ltd. ("Nintendo"), Apple Inc. ("Apple"), Google Inc. ("Google"), and Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"). Blizzard utilizes its proprietary
online gaming service, Battle.net®, to distribute most of Blizzard's content directly to PC consumers.
        In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard's Battle.net of fers players communications features, social networking, player matching and digital
content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of what Blizzard game they are playing. It attracts millions of active players, making it one
of the lar gest online game-related services in the world.
Manufacturing
        We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. W ith respect to products for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo consoles, our disk
duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned
by us.
        Microsoft, Sony , and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to
us for which we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order , even if the units do not ultimately sell. W e
7
Table of Contents
deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator , who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our
label.
Significant Customers and T op Franchises
Customers
        While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through our Battle.net platform, in other instances our customers
may be platform providers, such as Sony , Microsoft, and Apple, or retailers, such as W al-Mart and GameStop, who act as distributors of our content to end
consumers. For the year end December 31, 2016, Sony and Apple each accounted for 13% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sony and
Microsoft accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively , of our net revenues. W e did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.
        We had three customers—Sony , Microsoft, and W al-Mart Stores, Inc.—who accounted for 17%, 10%, and 10%, respectively , of consolidated gross
receivables at December 31, 2016, and 18%, 13%, and 1 1%, respectively , of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015.
Top Franchises
        For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top four franchises—Call of Duty , Candy Crush, W orld of W arcraft, and Overwatch—collectively accounted for
69% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top four franchises—Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, Destiny , and Hearthstone—
collectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top four franchises—Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, Skylanders,
and Diablo—collectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues.
Competition
        We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of
different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced.
We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality , and playability; brand name
recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing
support; and quality of customer service.
        We compete with other publishers of video game console, PC, and mobile interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors,
integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony , and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of
software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for
use by consumers. Further , we compete with publishers of mobile games. Lastly , with our Skylanders franchise and its toys and accessories, we compete
indirectly with companies who sell toys to our tar get consumers for this franchise.
Intellectual Property
        Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual
property . Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology , and other technology and trade secrets
8
Table of Contents
that we use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and
interact with when they are playing our games.
        We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, and Candy Crush, among
others. In other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements, such as for our Destiny franchise. Further , our products that play
on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product.
We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some
licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at
reasonable rates.
        We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property . For our PC products, we use copy protection technology or other
technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically
incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms. In addition, we
are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other
protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education
programs and legislative activity around the world.

Item 1A.    RISK F ACT ORS
        We wish to caution the r eader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewher e in this r eport or in our other
filings with the SEC, could cause our actual r esults to differ materially fr om those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and
elsewher e. These risks ar e not pr esented in order of importance or pr obability of occurr ence. Further , the risks described below ar e not the only risks
that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not curr ently known to us or that we curr ently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, r eputation, financial condition, r esults of operations, pr ofitability ,
cash flows, liquidity or stock price.
If we do not consistently deliver popular , high-quality content in a timely manner , or if consumers prefer competing products, our business may be negatively
impacted.
        Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and dif ficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only limited periods
of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements
to existing products. These products may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality . Further , competitors may develop content
that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, potentially taking sales away from them or reducing our ability to char ge the same prices we have
historically char ged for our products. These competing products may take a lar ger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause product sales
to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our
consumers, if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, if the use of cross-promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers becomes less
effective, or if our competitors develop more successful products or of fer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues and profit mar gins could decline.
Further , a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could potentially result in
additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received. The
increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received games typically generates
lower -than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games.
        Additionally , consumer expectations regarding the quality , performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our
brands, games, services and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to
manage ef fectively . For example, if our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because
they fail to function as
12
Table of Contents
advertised or otherwise, our sales may suf fer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they
involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy . Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing
the risk that a game may contain significant "bugs." If any of these issues occur , consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the
game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.
        Further , delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse ef fect on our
revenues and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially dif ferent from expectations. If we fail to release our products in a timely
manner , or if we are unable to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with
the game, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Additionally , the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in
developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for
such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate suf ficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to
recover the substantial up-front development and marketing costs associated with those products.
We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
        We follow a franchise model and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of
popular franchises. These products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty ,
Candy Crush, W orld of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively , accounted for approximately 69% of our net revenues, and a significantly higher
percentage of our operating income, for 2016. W e expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high
percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more
products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business. Additionally , if the popularity of a franchise declines, we may have to write of f the
unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, which could negatively impact our business. Further , if a new franchise does not gain consumer
acceptance, whether because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons, our business could be negatively
impacted.
We may be unable to ef fectively manage the growth in the scope and complexity of our business.
        We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the acquisition of King and the development of our
MLG, Studios and consumer products businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business. The growth of our
business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from,
our core businesses. If not managed ef fectively , this growth could result in the over -extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems,
information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in
any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business. Further , any failure by these new businesses may damage our
reputation or otherwise negatively impact our core business of interactive software products and entertainment content.

The increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a relatively small
number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.
        As a result of, among other things, the King Acquisition, we are more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance and monetize free-to-play games, such as
the games in our Candy Crush franchise and Hearthstone . As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free-to-play business model. For example, we
may invest in the development of new free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our
revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further , if: (1) we are unable to continue to
offer free-to-play games that encourage consumers to purchase our virtual currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items; (2) we fail to of fer
monetization features that appeal to these consumers; (3) these consumers do not continue to play our free-to-play games or purchase virtual items at the same
rate; (4) our platform providers make it more dif ficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual currency; or (5) we cannot encourage significant additional
consumers to purchase virtual items in our free-to-play games, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Furthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we expect new competitors to
enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to developing and marketing competing games and applications. W e compete, or may
compete, with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch casual games and other content using relatively limited
resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of consumers on mobile devices is intense, as the number of
applications on mobile devices has been increasing dramatically , which, in turn, has required increased marketing to garner consumer awareness and attention.
This increased competition could negatively impact our business. In addition, a continuing industry shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of
our other products by traditional retailers and distributors.
Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and
business models, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry . We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, distribution channels and
business models to emer ging technologies and delivery platforms in order to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products,
distribution channels and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or
distribution channels incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition
or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial "up front" cost of developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the
opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. Further , our competitors may adapt to an
emer ging technology or business model more quickly or ef fectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to
consumers, or both.
        If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to
pursue new business models, that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift
product development resources to that technology , platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more dif ficult to compete against existing products
incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model.

The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.
        The proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery , as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased importance
of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game,
particularly a new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution
and is played on a game console. Also, while digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit mar gins than retail sales, the risk profile for us, as the
publisher , may be increased as business shifts to digital distribution, since the volume of initial orders from retailers for physical discs could be reduced.
Competition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.
        Within the interactive entertainment industry , we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within and outside the United
States. Our competitors include very lar ge corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. Our
larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to provide lar ger budgets for development and
marketing and make higher of fers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop
more commercially successful video game products than we do. In addition, competitors with lar ge product lines and popular games typically have greater
leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers, who may be willing to promote products with less consumer appeal in return for access to those
competitors' more popular games.
        Additionally , we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Further , it is dif ficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer
demand that could materially alter public preferences for dif ferent forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to these
competitive pressures could negatively impact our business.
If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our products, our business may be negatively impacted.
        If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our console or PC titles or the associated downloadable content, whether due to competitive pressure,
because retailers or other third parties elect to price these products at a lower price, or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further , our
decisions around the development of new game content are grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is price compression in the market
after these decisions are made, it could have a negative impact on our business.
If we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to ef fectively conduct our business.
        Our employees are our greatest asset. As such, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify , attract, hire, retain and utilize the abilities
of qualified personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality , well-received content upon which our business
is substantially dependent. The software industry generally experiences a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for
employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative and/or management skills. W e may have dif ficulties in attracting and
retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the
services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.

We rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.
        We rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products, particularly in the mobile space. Because we depend on these developers,
we are subject to the following risks.
• Continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause
developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable
to us. 
• Limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to
completing products for us or require us to fund additional costs. 
• A competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we would not
be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually
obligated to complete development for us. 
• Reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over , development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those
when utilizing internal development resources.
        Increased competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game
developers. If the products subject to these arrangements do not generate suf ficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write of f
unrecovered portions of these payments, which could negatively impact our business. T ypically , we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net
revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty
advances are fully recouped. T o the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, it could
negatively impact our business.
We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter dif ficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the
transactions.
        As part of our business strategy , from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with, complementary
businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential for the acquired
business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our financial results to dif fer
from expectations in any given period, or over the longer -term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of the acquired
business's operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are dif ficult to predict, (iv) dif ficulty in integrating the acquired business, its
operations and its employees in an ef ficient and ef fective manner , (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition,
and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate
with our partner , (ii) our partner having economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be
unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which would require us to fulfill those obligations alone. Further , any such transaction may involve the risk that
our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any
intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future
16
Table of Contents
success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition. In addition to the above listed risks, by acquiring King we assumed certain liabilities that may
prove to be greater than anticipated. The liabilities we assumed include those with respect to King's ongoing legal proceedings, including the purported securities
class action lawsuit relating to King's initial public of fering in March 2014, and those with respect to King's potential tax liabilities in various jurisdictions. Any
of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses and adversely af fect our financial position.
Our debt could adversely af fect our business.
        As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $4.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our debt burden could have important consequences,
including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for , or reacting to, changes in our
business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy , working capital, capital expenditures, future business
opportunities, and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at floating rates of
interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for
working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing
market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our
cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without under going the costs of repatriating those funds.
        Agreements governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes, impose operating and financial restrictions
on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, under certain circumstances, our credit
agreement and indentures may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt and guarantees; pay distributions or dividends and
repurchase stock; make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain investments; create liens; enter into agreements that restrict dividends
from subsidiaries; engage in transactions with af filiates; and enter into mer gers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets. In addition, we are
required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under our credit agreement. Further , various risks,
uncertainties and events beyond our control could af fect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing
agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders
to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, we might not have suf ficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of
our obligations, including our obligations under our credit agreement or the indentures governing our notes. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing
agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. There can be no
assurances that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be
able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We may be involved in legal proceedings that have a negative impact on our business.
        From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business,
including actions with respect to intellectual
17
Table of Contents
property , competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance and commercial
claims. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer
groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation.
        Claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many of
which are outside of our control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a materially adverse impact on us due to legal costs, diversion of
management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, substantial
settlements, judgments, fines or penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities, products or
services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.
        There is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including
assessing the probability of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in
consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and
litigated outcomes and strategies. Further , it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based. If we fail to establish
appropriate reserves, our business could be negatively impacted.
Issues with the toys, accessories or hardware peripherals utilized in certain of our games may lead to product liability , personal injury or property damage
claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.
        We may experience issues with toys, accessories or peripherals (such as the toys and accessories sold with our Skylanders games or the hardware peripherals
sold with our Guitar Hero® games) that may lead to product liability , personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory
actions by governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased governmental scrutiny , harm to our reputation, reduced demand by
consumers for our products, decreased willingness by our customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide marketing support for , those products, denial or
increased cost for insurance coverage, or additional safety and testing requirements, any of which could negatively impact our business.
Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against publishers of interactive entertainment software products.
        In prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against us, by the families of victims of violence,
alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar
additional lawsuits could be filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the
prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we
might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor . Further , any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny , harm to our
reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide marketing
support for , those products. Such results could divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts
on our business.

We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year -end holiday buying
season in the fourth quarter of the year . As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the second half of the year , particularly for our Activision
segment. Receivables and credit risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year , as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of
the holiday season. Delays in development, approvals or manufacturing could af fect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods
such as the year -end holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our business.
Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we do business act in ways
that put our brand at risk.
        In many cases, our business partners are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property in order to provide
services and support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or
otherwise act in a way that places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to
adequately maintain or update their services and technologies or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a
disruption to our business operations or an adverse ef fect on our reputation, and may negatively impact our business.
We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and
services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.
        We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we of fer. Some open source software licenses require users who
distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works
of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that
such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. W ere it determined that
our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-
engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that
may divert resources away from our game development ef forts, any of which could negatively impact our business.
We may be subject to intellectual property claims.
        As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software
developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further , many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on
real-world things or people, which may also be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others, including right of publicity , trademark, and
unfair competition claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become subject to emer ging intellectual property
claims of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, third parties may still claim infringement,
particularly since there are many companies that focus exclusively on enforcing patent rights.
        From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or
not, may be time consuming, distracting to
19
Table of Contents
management and expensive to defend. Further , intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:
• cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property , which, if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable
terms; 
• redesign the af fected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce
commercial appeal of the af fected products; or 
• pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.
Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us
from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. W e may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content. Further , the use of
unauthorized "cheat" programs or the use of other unauthorized software modifications by users could lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.
        We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. W e own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.
The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further , we are aware that some unauthorized
copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur , it could negatively impact our business.
        Piracy is a persistent problem for us, and policing the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is dif ficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
Further , the laws of some countries in which our products are, or may be, distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our
products more dif ficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles and the operators of other platforms on which many of
our games are played, our ef forts and the ef forts of the console manufacturers and platform operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our
products in all instances. T echnology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by console manufacturers and platform operators or by us in our
products, the increasing availability of broadband access to the Internet, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain instances,
the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer -to-peer networks could result in an expansion in piracy .
        In addition, "cheating" programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games, such as those in our Candy
Crush franchise, could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our
applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release, which may result in lost revenue opportunities. This may lead to
lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these, either of which could negatively impact our
business.
20

        We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emer ging technologies.
Due to our reliance on third party platforms, platform licensors are frequently able to influence our products and costs
        Generally , when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms of fered by Sony , Microsoft, or Nintendo, the physical
products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator . The agreements with these manufacturers include certain
provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they char ge for the
manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment
software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all
of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors. Accordingly , Sony , Microsoft, or Nintendo could cause
unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which
could negatively impact our business.
        The platform licensors also control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we
provide online game capabilities for our console platform products. The control that the platform licensors have over the fee structures and/or retail pricing for
products and services for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our
profitability . With respect to certain downloadable content and microtransactions, the networks provided by these platform licensors are the exclusive means of
selling and distributing this content. Further , increased competition for limited premium "digital shelf space" has placed the platform licensors in an increasingly
better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale. If the platform licensor establishes terms that restrict our of ferings on its platform, or significantly impact the
financial terms on which these products or services are of fered to our customers, or does not renew our license or approve the inclusion of online capabilities in
our console products, our business could be negatively impacted.
        We also derive significant revenues from the distribution of free-to-play games on third-party web and mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store, the
Google Play Store, and Facebook, and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payment processing systems of these platform providers. These
platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our games. If these platforms modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication
channels available to developers, terms of service or other policies (including fees), or they develop their own competitive of ferings, our business could be
negatively impacted. Further , if these platform providers are required to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-app purchases or change
how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business could be negatively impacted.
Our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game platforms manufactured by third parties, as well as our ability to develop
commercially successful products for these platforms.
        We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PS4
and PS3, Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo's W ii U, W ii and soon-to-be-released Switch. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted
for 37% of our consolidated net revenues in 2016. The success of our console business is driven in lar ge part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms
will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. W e also rely on the availability of an
adequate supply of these video game platforms and the continued support for these platforms by their manufacturers. W e must make product development
decisions and
21
Table of Contents
commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform, and development costs for new console platforms may be greater
than those costs for the then-current console platforms. If increased costs are not of fset by higher revenues and other cost ef ficiencies, our business could be
negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market acceptance, we
may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.
The importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.
        In the United States and Canada, our "boxed" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses and game specialty stores. Our "boxed" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term
agreements or other forms of commitments, and our retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to
carry . The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could have adverse consequences. In addition,
having such a lar ge portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.
        Further , the concentration of sales in a small number of lar ge customers also makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these lar ge
customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment
industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. Challenging economic conditions may
impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-of f of accounts
receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insuf ficient. Moreover , even in cases where we have insurance to protect against a customer's
bankruptcy , insolvency or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of
non-payment. Further , the insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our
products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable. A payment default by , or the insolvency or business failure of, a
significant business partner could negatively impact our business.
        Moreover , the importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and
retailers. In some cases, return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with
terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise
unsold by them. W e may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, distributors and retail customers who meet certain conditions. These conditions
may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of
premium title releases. W e may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. Activision also of fers a
90-day limited warranty to end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price
protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide
substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. W e face similar issues and risks, including
exposure to risk of char gebacks, with respect to end users to whom we sell products directly , whether through our proprietary online gaming service or otherwise.
22
Table of Contents
        Further , retailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high-quality retail shelf space
and promotional support from retailers. Competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with
limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. W e cannot be certain that our new
products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly
better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product return policies. Our
products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. W e cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or
provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.
        Additionally , we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to
lower our prices below those levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business. Further , because we pay a licensing fee to the console hardware
manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform regardless of whether that product is actually sold, if we
overestimate demand and make too many physical "boxed" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units.
We are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the U.S.
        We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from
Europe, Asia and Australia. Moving forward, we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits
and, moreover , that sales in emer ging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be
increasingly , subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally , as well as risks inherent in doing business in emer ging markets, including increased tarif fs and
duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political,
regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements and enforcement on us and our platform partners and dif fering local
business practices, all of which may impact profit mar gins or make it more dif ficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.
        A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of
government regulations in such a country , could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a material
adverse ef fect on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its
approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
Additionally , in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our software. The future implementation of similar laws or
regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering
modifications to our products that are not cost-ef fective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to
purchase such products. Further , the enforcement of regulation of mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further
changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a material impact on our business in China.
        The majority of the manufacturers of our toys, accessories and hardware peripherals are third parties located in China. Anything that impacts our ability to
import these products or the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply us with hardware meeting our quality and safety
23
Table of Contents
standards or increases the manufacturers' costs of production may adversely impact our ability to supply that hardware to the market and the prices we must pay
for that hardware. Such impacts may include changes in safety , environmental or other regulations applicable to the hardware and the manufacturing thereof,
labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international companies operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw
materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs in China.
        We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners,
representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have
policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners,
representatives or agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover , it may be more dif ficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our
employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.
        Additionally , in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, commonly referred to as
"Brexit." This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty , particularly in the United Kingdom and the European Union, and this uncertainty may
persist for years. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor
confidence and the level of sales of discretionary items, including our products. Any of these ef fects could negatively impact our business.
        In addition, cultural dif ferences may af fect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S, or require us to
modify the content of the games or the method by which we char ge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer
preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.
Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.
        We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. Although we
believe our income tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position,
liquidity , or results of operations.
        Our income tax liability and ef fective tax rate could be adversely af fected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of earnings in
countries with dif fering statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax examinations or
investigations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity , or results of operations or
require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to
significant change. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax
laws applicable to multinational companies like us. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability , including
under transfer pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions
for uncertain tax positions.
        We earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, outside the United States. While our intent
is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would
24
Table of Contents
likely result in higher ef fective tax rates for the Company . In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how
U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether , or in what form, this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted
it could negatively impact our business.
        We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property , and goods and services taxes, in both
the United States and various other jurisdictions. T ax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in
the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.
        We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar , subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local
currencies, including euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona, which could fluctuate against the U.S.
dollar . Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,
particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. W e have, in the past, utilized currency
derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with natural of fsets. However , there can be no assurance that we
will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.
Our games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our target ratings for certain titles, or if our retailers
refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.
        Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB"), a self-regulatory body based in the U.S. that
provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such
as violence, nudity or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also
established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple's use of
its proprietary "App Rating System" and Google Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. If we are unable to obtain the ratings
we have tar geted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, we may be required to modify our products to comply with
the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories.
Further , if one of our games is "re-rated" for any reason, a ratings or ganization could require corrective actions, which could include a recall, retailers could refuse
to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously purchased.
        Additionally , retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material
or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system,
or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit
material or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that
retailer .
25
Table of Contents
        Further , throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry , many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden
gameplay features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay
experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent
hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content, and the ESRB has required the recall of the
game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or
imposed fines on the publisher . Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves,
refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have
reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from
buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the
publisher of the product containing such content.
        We have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software
products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error , circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If an
interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.
Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business could be negatively impacted.
        Legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may af fect the way in which we, and
other industry participants, may of fer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. The video game industry continues to evolve, and new and
innovative business opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. Many foreign countries, such as China and Germany , have laws that permit
governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products because of the content therein (and similar
legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States). Further , the growth and development of electronic
commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on
operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. W e are subject to laws and regulations related to protection of
minors, consumer privacy , accessibility , advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property , distribution, and antitrust, among others. Also, existing laws or new
laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency , banking institutions, virtual currencies, unclaimed property , and money laundering may
be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt
calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business
through the Internet and mobile devices. The adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our
products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to of fer to our customers and the size of the
potential market for our products may be limited. W e may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing
strategies to comply with regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. The laws and regulations af fecting our products vary by territory
and may be inconsistent with one another , imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in
government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Moreover , the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an
adverse impact on our reputation
26
Table of Contents
and consumers' willingness to purchase our products. Because the King Acquisition has significantly increased our user population, it may subject us to laws and
regulations in additional jurisdictions and exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.
        Although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe
that playing these games does not constitute gambling, our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and
expose us to civil and criminal penalties. W e also sometimes of fer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional
opportunities. W e are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and of fering of such activities and games, many of which are still
evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. If these were to occur , we might be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals
from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements, and we may be subject to additional
regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or
the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services
and impair our business.
The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.
        Consumers play certain of our games online using third-party platforms and networks, through online social platforms, and on mobile devices. W e collect
and store information about our consumers of these games—both personally identifying and non-personally identifying information. W e are subject to laws from
a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information. For example, the European Union (the "E.U.") has traditionally taken a broader
view than the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy
regulations. The U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPP A") also regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children
under 13 years of age. Failure to comply with COPP A may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, and result in
substantial fines.
        Data privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which could impact our approach to operating
and marketing our games. For example, the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), which will come into ef fect in May 2018, imposes a range
of new compliance obligations for us and other companies with European users, and increases financial penalties for noncompliance significantly . The U.S.
government, including the Federal T rade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the
collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices, and the E.U. has proposed reforms to its
existing data protection legal framework, including the GDPR. V arious government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and
changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers to solicit, collect and provide us with information
regarding our consumers that is necessary for compliance with these various types of regulations.
        Player interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements ("EULAs"), and terms of service. If we fail to comply with
our posted privacy policies, EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could
result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation,
impact our financial condition and harm our business. If regulators, the media, or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or
consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result
27
Table of Contents
in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, and damage our business.
We depend on servers to operate our games with online features and our proprietary online gaming service. If we were to lose server functionality for any
reason, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to maintain more than
sufficient server capacity , and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a
significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company
on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with
online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether , any of which could result in the loss of sales for , or in, such games. This risk is
particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third-party owned data centers located in one city ,
or with respect to the functioning of our proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net®, the disruption of which could prevent Blizzard from delivering content
digitally or render all of Blizzard's games unavailable.
        We also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable
console and PC game content and the functionality of our games with online features. Similarly , we rely on the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the
Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency for our free-to-play games. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely
affect our ability to sell and distribute our digital products and operate our games with online features, negatively impacting our business.
        Further , insuf ficient server capacity could also negatively impact our business. Conversely , if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our
business, we may incur additional operating costs.
We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant data breach or system or network disruption could
negatively impact our business.
        In the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as the
source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers, and
employees. A  malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally
identifiable information) and other sensitive data (including credit card information maintained in a proprietary database) is stored could lead to piracy of our
software, fraudulent activity , disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers', consumers' or employees' personally identifiable information or our
own sensitive business data. These attacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or
for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to data security breaches, or a security-
related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or
incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional security measures, or suf fer reputational damage. Moreover , if there were a public perception
that our data protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or
the public perception of our business model. In addition, such data security breaches may subject us to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory
investigations and actions, especially if there is loss,

disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers' credit card or other sensitive or personally identifiable information.
Our reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.
        Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies af fecting revenue recognition have af fected, and could further significantly
affect, the way we report revenues related to our products and services. W e recognize a majority of the revenues from bundled sales ( i.e., video games that include
an online service component) on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products.
Further , as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change and we could be
required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product
offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and taxes, could have
a significant impact on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any
given period.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.
        Our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings.
The regulations on shareholder action could make it more dif ficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of
actions that would support this ef fort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called "blank check"
preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could ef fectively dilute the interests of any
person seeking control or otherwise make it more dif ficult to obtain control.
Historically , our stock price has been highly volatile.
        The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including for example,
but without limitation:
• quarter -to-quarter variations in results of operations; 
• the announcement of new products; 
• the announcement of lower prices on competing products; 
• product development or release schedules; 
• general conditions in the computer , software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or in the worldwide economy; 
• announcements of developments in the overall worldwide market for interactive entertainment, including announcements of industry sales data; 
• the timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms; 
• hardware manufacturers' announcements of price changes for hardware platforms; 
• consumer acceptance of hardware platforms;
29
Table of Contents
• consumer spending trends; 
• the outcome of lawsuits or regulatory investigations in which we are, or may become, involved; 
• changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; 
• sales or acquisitions of common stock by our directors or executive management; and 
• investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position, and those of our competitors and customers.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
        Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the Los Angeles, California area and our primary corporate disaster
recovery data center is in Las V egas, Nevada, each of which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the
destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business
operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and negatively impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of
these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further , our system redundancy may be
ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be suf ficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers,
distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.
If general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.
        Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary
purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are
sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in
our selling and promotional expenses, in an ef fort to of fset that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.

(1) During the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The
standard, among other things, requires excess tax benefits and shortfalls associated with share-based payments to be reported within
operating activities instead of financing activities, as was required under previous guidance. W e elected to apply this guidance
retrospectively for all periods presented resulting in increases in our operating cash flows of $67 million, $39 million, $29 million, and
$5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively , when compared to prior periods.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF OPERA TIONS
Business Overview
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. W e develop and distribute content and
services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, PC, and mobile devices.
The King Acquisition
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further described in Note 21 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.
Reportable Segments
        Based upon our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.
(i)    Activision
        Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision
primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-
party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally
developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.
(ii)   Blizzar d
        Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard
primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of
software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates
digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user -generated content for Blizzard games.
(iii)  King
        King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and
iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's games are free-to-play ,
however players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency .
(iv)  Other
        We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
• The MLG business, which is devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming ef forts by celebrating the success of our players and
creating ways to deliver a best-in-class fan experience
36
Table of Contents
across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium
content;
• The Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our extensive library of iconic and globally
recognized intellectual properties; and 
• The Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Business Results and Highlights
Financial Results
        The Company's 2016 financial highlights include:
• 2016 consolidated net revenues increased 42% to $6.6 billion and 2016 consolidated operating income increased 7% to $1.4 billion, inclusive of
King's results of operations since the King Closing Date, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $4.7 billion and consolidated operating
income of $1.3 billion in 2015. 
• Revenues from digital online channels increased 94% to $4.9 billion in 2016, as compared to $2.5 billion in 2015. 
• Operating mar gin was 21.4% for 2016, compared with 28.3% in 2015. The lower mar gin was driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets
acquired in the King Acquisition. 
• We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 71% as compared to $1.3 billion in 2015. 
• Consolidated net income increased 8% to $966 million in 2016, as compared to $892 million in 2015. 
• Our diluted earnings per common share increased 8% to $1.28 in 2016, as compared to $1.19 in 2015.
        Since certain of our games are hosted or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-
inconsequential separate deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the
relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year . Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 include a net ef fect of $9 million
from the recognition of deferred net revenues.
        Also, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the King Acquisition, our net revenues include $1.5 billion and our net income includes a net loss
of $230 million from King's operations, after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and
deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues. The majority of these U.S. GAAP accounting char ges do not impact the economics or operating cash flows of
our business, although they had a material impact on our 2016 U.S. GAAP results and will have a material impact on our 2017 U.S. GAAP results.
Release Highlights
        Games and digital downloadable content released, among others, during the year ended December 31, 2016 included:
• Four downloadable content packs for Call of Duty: Black Ops III ;
37
Table of Contents
• Three content packs for Hearthstone ; 
• Overwatch ; 
• Farm Her oes Super Saga™ ; 
• World of W arcraft: Legion™ ; 
• Destiny: Rise of Ir on (expansion pack for Destiny ); 
• Skylanders Imaginators ; and 
• Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e™, featuring  Modern W arfar e® Remaster ed.
Monthly Active Users ("MAUs"): Measuring the Size and Engagement of Our User Base
        We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and its regular engagement with our portfolio of games. MAUs are the number of
individuals who played a particular game in a given month. W e calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in
a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. In
addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would
be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a
single user .
        The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary
surge in MAUs. Accordingly , although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period
fluctuations may not be indicative of longer -term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for our reportable
segments (amounts in millions):
        Average MAUs decreased by 35 million, or 7%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The
decrease in King's average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises that are lar gely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network. The increase
in Activision's average MAUs is reflective of the launch of Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e in November 2016 along with Call of Duty: Black Ops III  continuing to
have strong MAU retention relative to previous releases.
        Average MAUs decreased by 83 million, or 16%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The
decrease in King's average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises that are lar gely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network. This
decrease is partially of fset by the increase in Blizzard's average MAUs, driven by the release of Overwatch  in May 2016.
International Sales
        International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically
directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 48%, 48%, and 50% of our

total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively . The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries is
generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany , Italy , Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our
international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in
local economies. Accordingly , our future results could be materially and adversely af fected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local
economies.
Management's Overview of Business T rends
Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth
        Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry . Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we
estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 19% annually over the last four years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the
market as interactive entertainment becomes more common place across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
        Further , the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for
gaming significantly . Smart phones and associated free-to-play games have introduced gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowed gaming to occur
more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is now estimated to be lar ger than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a
leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games. In addition, our other segments have mobile ef forts underway that present the opportunity for us to drive
additional player investment from our franchises.
Opportunities T o Expand Franchises Outside of Games
        Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable
content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emer ging opportunities to drive player investment
outside of game purchases. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our ef forts to build these additional opportunities are
still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises
        The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry . According to The NPD Group, the
top 10 titles accounted for 32% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2016. Similarly , a significant portion of our revenues has
historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of
our profits. For example, the Call of Duty , Candy Crush, World of W arcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively , accounted for 69% of our consolidated net
revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2016.
        The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10
console franchises in 2016, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly , according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App
Annie Intelligence, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 24 months.
        In addition to investing in and developing sequels and content for our top titles, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises.
Further , we invest in new properties in an ef fort to develop the future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone  and Destiny , in 2015, we released
39
Table of Contents
Heroes of the Storm , and on May 24, 2016, we released Overwatch . There is no guarantee these investments will result in established franchises. Additionally , to
diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we acquired King.
        Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our , and the industry's,
revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly , our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top
franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality
        Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to of fer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business to a more recurring and year -
round model. Of fering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout
the year . This incremental content not only provides additional high-mar gin revenue, it can also increase engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play
games more broadly , are generally less seasonal.
        While our business is transitioning to a year -round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. W e have
historically experienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the year -end holiday buying season, which occurs in the fourth quarter . As we
make the shift to a year -round model and also now include the operating results of King, which focuses on free-to-play games, less of our revenues are coming
from the fourth quarter . For our reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King—the percentage of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2016
decreased by 10% year -over -year to 36%, compared with 46% in 2015.
Outlook
        In 2017, we will have a lighter slate of full-game releases than 2016, which we expect to result in lower revenues and earnings per share than we had in
2016. For Activision, we do expect to release the first sequel to Destiny  and a new Call of Duty title in the second half of the year , however , our Skylanders
franchise will not have a new full console game launch in 2017. Across our businesses, we will continue to focus on our opportunities for year -round player
engagement and investment.
        While our results for 2017 will include the full-year operations of King, the expected results will continue to be impacted by additional accounting char ges
associated with the King Acquisition, which include, among other things, integration and acquisition-related costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting
from purchase price accounting adjustments, and the related tax impact from the King Acquisition. While the majority of these GAAP accounting char ges will not
impact the economics or operating cash flows of our business, they will have a material impact on our GAAP results.
        Finally , one of our current initiatives is to create an esports equivalent of the world's established major professional sport leagues. This may provide for
additional opportunities in 2017 through strategically important emer ging new revenue streams, including possible team sales for the Overwatch League ™, the
associated media rights, and in-game advertising.

in our consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows: 
Cost of revenues—product sales:
(i) "Product costs"—includes the manufacturing cost of goods produced and sold. This generally includes product costs,
manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. W e generally
recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones). 
(ii) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and
royalties attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are

Consolidated Net Revenues
        The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues and the increase/(decrease) in deferred revenues recognized for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014 (amounts in millions):
Consolidated net revenues
2016 vs. 2015
        The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:
• New revenues from King titles following the King Closing Date, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise. 
• Revenues recognized from Overwatch , a new team-based first-person shooter released in May 2016. 
• Higher revenues recognized in 2016 from Call of Duty: Black Ops III , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was the third game in
our successful Black Ops series, as compared to revenues recognized in 2015 from Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2014, including, in each case, the associated digital content.
        The increase was partially of fset by:
• Lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, as Destiny  debuted in September 2014 but had no comparable full-game release in 2015.
42which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase
accounting attributable to product sales revenues.
Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other revenues:
(i) "Game operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and
server costs, platform provider fees, and payment provider fees. 
(ii) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and
royalties attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the
respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets
recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing, and other revenues.
Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
(2) Represents the loss on extinguishment of debt we recognized during 2016 as a result of the extinguishment of certain term loan and senior
note facilities through our refinancing activities, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and write-of f of unamortized discount
and financing costs of $29 million.

• Lower revenues from Skylanders Imaginators , which was released in October 2016, as compared to Skylanders Super chargers, the comparable
2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise in 2016. 
• Lower revenues recognized from the Diablo franchise due to the timing of releases.
2015 vs. 2014
        The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:
• Higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, as Destiny  debuted in September 2014. 
• Higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone , which were partially driven by its incremental release on iPhone and Android smartphones in April
2015.
        The increase was partially of fset by:
• Lower revenues from Skylanders SuperChar gers, as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam, the comparable 2014 title. 
• Lower revenues recognized from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls™  and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition™ , which were released in
March 2014 on PC and in August 2014 on consoles, respectively .
Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized
2016 vs. 2015
        The decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:
• Deferrals of revenues associated with the release of World of W arcraft: Legion  in August 2016, as compared to the recognition of deferred
revenues in 2015 from the release of World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor®  in November 2014. 
• Deferrals of revenues associated with Overwatch.
        The decrease was partially of fset by lower deferrals of revenues associated with the Call of Duty franchise, driven by lower revenue deferrals from Call of
Duty: Infinite W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III , the comparable 2015 title.
2015 vs. 2014
        The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:
• Lower deferrals of revenues from the Destiny  franchise, which debuted in September 2014. 
• Lower deferrals of revenues from World of W arcraft , primarily associated with World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , which was released in
November 2014, and value-added services
        The increase was partially of fset by higher deferrals of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $81 million, $373 million, and $2 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in
2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively , as compared to the same periods in the previous year . The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro and British pound.

Operating Segment Results
        Currently , we have three reportable operating segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and
managed by our Chief Executive Of ficer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the
impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense;
amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; and fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses and accruals) related to
acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis,
and accordingly , no disclosure is made with respect thereto.
        Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal or ganization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the
availability of separate financial information. W e do not aggregate operating segments.

(2) We have determined that some of our titles' online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result, represents
a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable. As such, we are required to recognize revenues from these titles over the estimated
service periods, which are generally less than one year . The related cost of revenues are deferred and recognized when the related
revenues are recognized. In the operating segment results table, we reflect the net ef fect from the deferral of revenues and (recognition) of
deferred revenues, along with the related cost of revenues, on certain of our online enabled products.

Segment Net Revenues
Activision
2016 vs. 2015
        The decrease in Activision's net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:
• Lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III ,
the comparable 2015 title, which was the third game in our successful Black Ops series. 
• Lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, as there were two expansion packs in 2015— House of W olves  and The T aken King —but only one in
2016— Rise of Ir on. 
• Lower revenues from Skylanders Imaginators , which was released in October 2016, as compared to Skylanders Super chargers, the comparable
2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone Skylanders toys and accessories in 2016. 
• Lower revenues from Guitar Her o Live , which was released in 2015 with no comparable release in 2016.
        The decrease was partially of fset by higher revenues from digital content associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III , as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfar e, the comparable 2014 title.
2015 vs. 2014
        The increase in Activision's net revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:
• Higher revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, specifically from Call of Duty: Black Ops III , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015,
as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
• Strong digital content performance, including expansion packs and supply drops for Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e. 
• Revenues from Guitar Her o Live , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no comparable release in 2014.
46(3) We expense our share-based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards. In the case of liability
awards, the liability is subject to revaluation based on the stock price at the end of the relevant period. Included within this share-based
compensation are the net ef fects of capitalization, deferral, and amortization. 
(4) We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits.
The amounts presented in the table represent the ef fect of the amortization of intangible assets, as well as other purchase price accounting
adjustments, where applicable, in our consolidated statements of operations. 
(5) We incurred fees and other expenses, such as legal, banking and professional services fees, related to (a) the October 1 1, 2013 repurchase
of approximately 429 million shares of our common stock (the "Purchase T ransaction"), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among
us, V ivendi and ASAC II LP , an exempted limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands, acting by its general
partner , ASAC II LLC, (b) the King Acquisition, and (c) other business acquisitions and associated integration activities, in each case,
inclusive of any related debt financings. Such expenses are not reviewed by the CODM as part of segment performance.

released in August 2014 on consoles. 
• World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , which was released in November 2014, along with the overall lower revenues from World of W arcraft
due to a smaller subscriber base.
        The decrease was partially of fset by:

Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)
2016 vs 2015
        The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• Sales and marketing spending to support King's titles and new launches, including Candy Crush Jelly Saga and Farm Her oes Super Saga . 
• Sales and marketing spending to support Blizzard's new title, Overwatch.
        The increase was partially of fset by lower sales and marketing expenditures on Guitar Her o Live  and the Destiny franchise given the timing of game
launches.

2015 vs 2014

currency derivative contracts and lower share-based compensation expense. This decrease was partially of fset by increased professional service fees incurred,
primarily in connection with the King Acquisition.

Inter est and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions)
2016 vs 2015
        The increase in interest and other expense, net, for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to interest expense associated with the new $2.3 billion
tranche of term loans "A" that were incurred in connection with the King Acquisition. This increase was partially of fset by lower interest expense related to our
prior term loan because of voluntary prepayments on the principal we made throughout 2016, with the prior term loan being fully extinguished in September
2016. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below as included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding our debt
activities.
2015 vs 2014
        Interest and other expense, net, for 2015 was comparable to 2014.
Income T ax Expense (Benefit) (amounts in millions)
        For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1,106 million, $1,121 million, and
$981 million, respectively , and our income tax expense was $140 million (or a 13% ef fective tax rate), $229 million (or a 20% ef fective tax rate), and
$146 million (or a 15% ef fective tax rate), respectively . Overall, our ef fective tax rate dif fers from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to earnings
taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of excess tax benefits from shared-based payments (as discussed further below), recognition of
the research and development ("R&D") credits, partially of fset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.
        In 2016 and 2015, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $228 million and $355 million, respectively , and comprised 21% and 32%, respectively ,
of our consolidated income before income tax expense. In 2016 and 2015, our foreign income before income tax expense was $878 million and $766 million,
respectively , and comprised 79% and 68%, respectively , of our consolidated income before income tax expense.
        In 2016 and 2015, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered
our ef fective tax rate by 22 percentage points and 20 percentage points, respectively . The increase in the foreign rate dif ferential is due to the overall increase in
foreign income, which is taxed at relatively lower rates in proportion to U.S. income.
        In 2015 and 2014, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered
our ef fective tax rate by 20 percentage points and 25 percentage points, respectively . The decrease in the foreign rate dif ferential is due to overall increase in
foreign income in higher statutory rate jurisdictions, as compared to the prior year .

Table of Contents
        The overall ef fective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction,
applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and
variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss. Further , the ef fective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and
could be adversely af fected by the extent that income (loss) before income tax expenses (benefit) is lower than anticipated in foreign regions, where taxes are
levied at relatively lower statutory rates, and/or higher than anticipated in the United States, where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates.
        Further analysis of the dif ferences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated ef fective tax rate, as well as other information about our
income taxes, is provided in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally , see
"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" for discussion on our early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based payments that requires
that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we
recognized $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in 2016. Conversely , in 2015 and 2014, $65 million and $30 million, respectively , were credited to
shareholders' equity .
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $10 million, a negative impact of $242 million, and a negative impact of $8 million on Activision
Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively . The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.
Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
        We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business
to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows. Our primary sources of liquidity , which are available to us to fund cash outflows
such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term
investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. W ith our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.3 billion at December 31,
2016, and the expected cash flows provided by our operating activities, we believe that we have suf ficient liquidity to meet daily operations for the foreseeable
future. W e also believe that we have suf ficient working capital ($2.2 billion at December 31, 2016) to finance our operational and financing requirements for at
least the next twelve months. Additionally , we have the availability of a $250 million revolving credit facility .
        As of December 31, 2016, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.9 billion, as compared to
$0.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. If the cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are needed in the future for our operations in the U.S., we would
accrue and pay the required U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However , our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current
plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.
        Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which
are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase
shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These
transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)
 
Cash Flows Pr ovided by Operating Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows associated with our operating activities include the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our
products and services. These collections are typically partially of fset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products;
payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt;
payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.
2016 vs 2015
        Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2016 were $2.16 billion, as compared $1.26 billion for 2015. The increase was primarily due to:
• New operating cash flows contributed by King. 
• Higher net income in 2016, as compared to 2015, along with lar ger adjustments to net income for non-cash char ges, primarily associated with the
amortization of the acquired intangibles in the King Acquisition, higher stock compensation expense due to converted awards for King personnel
in the acquisition, and other non-cash or non-operating costs associated with our debt-related activities during the year .
        Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $209 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as
compared to $193 million paid in 2015.
2015 vs 2014
        Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2015 were $1.26 billion, as compared to $1.33 billion for 2014. The decrease was primarily due to changes in
operating assets and liabilities, driven by the 2014 cash flows benefiting from a substantial increase in revenues that were deferred. The decrease

        Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $193 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash
used for acquisitions.
2016 vs 2015
        Cash flows used in investing activities for 2016 were $1.18 billion, as compared to $3.72 billion for 2015. The lower amount of cash used in investing
activities in 2016 was primarily due to a 2015 cash outflow of $3.6 billion for cash placed into escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition. In 2016, when we
acquired King, the cash in escrow became a cash inflow . As a result, in 2016 we had a $2.2 billion cash outflow for the King Acquisition in excess of the cash
already in escrow , net of $1.15 billion of cash acquired from King.
2015 vs 2014
        Cash flows used in investing activities for 2015 were $3.72 billion, as compared to $82 million used in 2014. The higher amount of cash used in investing
activities in 2015 was primarily due to the $3.6 billion of cash deposited in escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition, as well as the cash used to acquire Major
League Gaming in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Cash Flows Pr ovided by (Used in) Financing Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions
involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of options, as well as the payment of dividends.
2016 vs 2015
        Cash flows provided by financing activities for 2016 were $500 million, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $202 million for 2015. The
difference was primarily due to $6.9 billion of proceeds received from the following debt issuances in 2016:
• Issuance of a $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A" on February 23, 2016 to fund the King Acquisition. 
• Issuance of an additional $250 million tranche of term loans "A" on March 31, 2016. 
• Issuance of a new unsecured $2.9 billion tranche of term loans "A" in connection with the fifth amendment to our credit agreement on August 23,
2016. 
• Issuance of $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 on September 19, 2016. 
• Issuance of $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 on September 19, 2016.
62
Table of Contents
        These issuances were partially of fset by:
• Repayments of $1.9 billion to extinguish our term loan outstanding at December 31, 2015 (the "Original T erm Loan"). 
• Repayments of $2.5 billion in connection with the refinancing of our tranche of term loans "A" that were provided in the first quarter of 2016. 
• Repayments of $185 million on our new tranche of term loans "A" that were provided on August 23, 2016, which included $167 million of
voluntary prepayments, as compared to the $250 million partial repayment of our Original T erm Loan in 2015. 
• Cash payment to redeem our 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "Original 2021 Notes") of $1.5 billion, as well as the
associated $63 million premium. 
• Higher cash dividend payments made during 2016, as compared to 2015.
        Cash flows used in financing activities for 2015 also included proceeds of $202 million received in the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase
Transaction. There were no such proceeds received in 2016.
2015 vs 2014
        Cash flows used in financing activities for 2015 were $202 million, as compared to $413 million for 2014. The lower amount of cash flows used in financing
activities was primarily due to:
• Proceeds of $202 million received in the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction. 
• A lower partial repayment of our Original T erm Loan during 2015 of $250 million, as compared to the $375 million partial repayment of our
Original T erm Loan during 2014.
        These decreases were partially of fset by:
• Lower proceeds from stock options exercised by our employees during 2015 than during 2014. 
• Higher cash dividend payments made during 2015, as compared to 2014.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had negative impacts of $56 million, $366 million, and $396 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively . The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound.
Debt
        As of December 31, 2016, our total outstanding debt was $4.9 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.92%, as compared to $4.1 billion at
December 31, 2015, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 4.63%. During 2016, we had the following significant debt activities:
• Entered into three amendments to our credit agreement to provide for a $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A" on February 23, 2016, to fund the
King Acquisition. 
• Entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement on March 31, 2016, to provide for an additional tranche of term loans "A" in the amount
of $250 million (together with the $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A", the "Original TLA").
63
Table of Contents
• Made voluntary principal prepayments on the remaining balance of our Original T erm Loan of $500 million, $250 million, and $800 million on
February 25, March 31, and May 26, 2016, respectively , to reduce the remaining outstanding principal balance to $319 million. 
• On August 23, 2016, entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement to provide for (1) a new unsecured tranche of term loans "A" of
approximately $2.9 billion (the "2016 TLA"), the proceeds of which were primarily used to extinguish the remaining outstanding principal
balances of $319 million on the Original T erm Loan and $2.5 billion on the Original TLA, resulting in a write-of f of unamortized discount and
deferred financing costs of $10 million, and (2) a new unsecured revolving credit facility of $250 million. 
• On September 19, 2016, issued $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "New 2021 Notes") and $850 million of
3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the "2026 Notes" and, together with the New 2021 Notes, the "New Notes"). 
• On October 19, 2016, using the proceeds from the New Notes, redeemed the Original 2021 Notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in a loss
on extinguishment of approximately $82 million, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and a write-of f of unamortized discount and
deferred financing costs of $19 million. 
• On September 30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, made a voluntary prepayment on our 2016 TLA of
$167 million. These payments satisfied the required quarterly principal repayments through December 31, 2018.
        As a result of the above activities, a summary of our debt as of December 31, 2016, is as follows (amounts in millions):
        A summary of our debt as of December 31, 2015, is as follows (amounts in millions):
        On February 3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment to our credit agreement which (i) provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate
principal amount of $2.55 billion (the "2017 TLA") and (ii) released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantee provided under the credit
agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA, together with additional cash funds on hand, were used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA outstanding under the credit
agreement immediately prior to the ef fectiveness of the sixth amendment, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other
than the absence of guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA.

Capital Expenditures
        We made capital expenditures of $136 million in 2016, as compared to $1 11 million in 2015. In 2017, we anticipate total capital expenditures of
approximately $130 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.
Commitments
        Refer to Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures regarding our

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
        At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as
"structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating of f-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future ef fect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity , capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could dif fer from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed
throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies af fect our reported and expected
financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with
financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the ef fect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting
policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.
Revenue Recognition
        We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer , the collection of our
fees is reasonably assured, and the
65
Table of Contents
amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these
products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product is sold to the customer .
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic
605. These revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software, service (such as ongoing hosting arrangements), and hardware deliverables
(such as peripherals or other ancillary collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software).
        When a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, we allocate revenue to each
element based on a selling price hierarchy . The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor -specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-
party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element
arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software
deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy . Further , if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the
software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.
        As noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP . We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required
using BESP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the
actual price char ged by the Company for deliverables that the Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar
products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).
Product Sales
        Product sales consists of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. W e recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. W ith respect to
digital full-game downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay . Revenues from product sales are recognized after
deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.
Product with Online Functionality or Hosted Service Arrangements
        For our software products with online functionality or that are part of a hosted service arrangement, we evaluate whether that online functionality constitutes
a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on
(including downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of the online functionality's importance to gameplay , we
consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. In addition, VSOE of fair value does not exist for the online functionality
of some products, as we do not separately char ge for this
66
Table of Contents
component. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any such title (including downloadable content) and recognize the
revenues ratably over the estimated service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer the cost of revenues for the title and recognize the cost of revenues as
the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are initially deferred include manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and
intellectual property licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.
        For our software products with online functionality that are considered to be incidental to the overall product of fering and are inconsequential deliverables,
we recognize the related revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.
        For our World of W arcraft  boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related subscription
service revenues ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. For revenues
associated with the sales of subscriptions, the revenues are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably
over the subscription period. Revenues attributed to the sale of World of W arcraft  boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales,"
whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."
Micr otransaction Revenues
        Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the
sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a
player uses the virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency . Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are also recognized as revenues when a player
uses the virtual goods. W e categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a
specific player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent
goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the
period of time the goods are available to the player , which is generally the estimated service period of the game.
Estimated Service Period
        We determine the estimated service period for players of our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted-average number of
days between players' first and last date played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the
weighted-average number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends, the service periods of
our previously released games, and the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours, to the extent they are publicly available.
Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage patterns and
therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than twelve
months.
Allowances for Returns and Price Protection
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent
reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to
67
Table of Contents
meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. W e benchmark units to be shipped to our
customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and
payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may also consider other factors, including achievement of sell-
through performance tar gets in certain instances, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory , and other market factors.
        Significant management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenues must be made and used when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. W e estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer . The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title:
historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life
cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-
hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the
performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality ,
and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor , or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. There may be material dif ferences in the amount
and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's
assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2016 allowance for sales
returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $3 million.
Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence
        We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. W e write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined
primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the dif ference between the cost of the inventory and net
realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently dif ficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of loss
recognition, a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase
in that newly established basis.
Software Development Costs
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such
68
Table of Contents
costs are determined to be recoverable. T echnological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or
the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when
technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may
occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project
phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release,
if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development" in the
period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately to "Product development."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months to approximately two years.
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods,
the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for
the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which
the sequel is based.
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised
forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be
lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment char ge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and timing of
expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.
Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do not
meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
69
Table of Contents
        Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,
together with the tax ef fects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be suf ficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be char ged to tax expenses in the period such
determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC T opic
740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our
business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.
        Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves
are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be dif ferent from that which is reflected in our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. W e adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is dif ferent than the amounts recorded, such dif ferences will impact the provision for income taxes in the
period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered
appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
        Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) earnings being lower than anticipated in foreign regions where
taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates and/or higher than anticipated in the United States where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates;
(2) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax ef fects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to intercompany
realignments; (5) dif ferences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses; (6) changes in
accounting principles; or (7) changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles or interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws
applicable to multinational corporations, such as changes currently being considered in the U.S., the European Union and its member states, and other countries.
Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.
The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if
settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by
the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. W e regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an
adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Fair V alue Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our
consolidated financial statements. W ithout an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us
to make several assumptions that are inherently dif ficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.
        There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or
comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for
example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to
replace an asset. For many of
70
Table of Contents
our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires
the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or
equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows; (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt
or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium). Determining these cash flow estimates is
inherently dif ficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial
results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value
resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset
may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for
several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:
        Business Combinations.     We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Our assessment of the
estimated fair value of each of these can have a material ef fect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives.
Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is
not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to
extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology . Such
estimates are inherently dif ficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.
        Assessment of Impairment of Assets.     We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a
potential impairment exists. W e consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other
long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to: (1) significant changes in performance
relative to expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant negative industry or economic trends; (4) a significant decline
in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy . In determining whether an impairment exists, we estimate the
undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets'
carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value
of the assets. W e did not record an impairment char ge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.
        Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles provides companies
an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value before performing a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit as part of our annual impairment test performed as of
December 31. Our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both (1) discrete financial
information is available and (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. ASC T opic 350 requires that the impairment test
be performed at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit
level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each
reporting unit.
71
Table of Contents
        To determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments
and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating mar gins used to
calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.
These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are
based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we
are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment char ges. W e base our fair value
estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may dif fer from those estimates.
        In determining the fair value of our significant reporting units—namely Activision, Blizzard, and King—we assumed discount rates ranging from 8.5% to
11.5% and terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 4.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative
evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2016. For our King reporting
unit, which includes $2.7 billion of goodwill, the estimated fair value exceeded the book value by approximately 18%, while the remaining reporting units had
excesses of at least 100%. However , changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial
performance, our ability to successfully release new products and maintain our existing franchises, monetization of our user network, and changes in economic
conditions, including those which may change our discount rates and are outside of our control, could result in future impairment char ges. For example, as of
December 31, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate for our King reporting unit would reduce the percentage by which the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value to 10%.
        We test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we
concluded that no impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur . In determining the fair value of these trade names, we
assumed a discount rate of 8.5%, and royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%-2.0%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which
will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment char ges.
Share-Based Payments
        We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for a given
grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based
payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
        We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is af fected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant,
reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock rights holder will not participate. Certain
restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest based
72
Table of Contents
on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock rights, each quarter we update our assessment of
the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. W e amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite
service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock rights, we estimate the fair
value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated
forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock
rights at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market
condition is not achieved. However , the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
        For share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative
catch-up adjustment for changes in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.
        For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements
        Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities for fiscal 2016. For a detailed discussion
of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-
K.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
Share-Based Payments
        In March 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other things:
• requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of
operations and that the tax ef fects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur; 
• requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and 
• permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as
currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur .
        We elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. As part of the
adoption, we made certain elections, including the following:
• to apply the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods
presented; and 
• to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.
73
Table of Contents
        As a result of the adoption, we recognized excess tax benefits of $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further , given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of
cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased by $67 million and
$39 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively . The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.
Statement of Cash Flows
        In August 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires,
among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as
opposed to operating activities as is required under existing guidance. W e elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2016 and applied it
retrospectively . As a result of the adoption of this standard, our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the
$63 million premium payment from the October 19, 2016 redemption of our Original 2021 Notes. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
our consolidated statements of cash flows upon adoption for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
Revenue r ecognition
        In May 2014, the F ASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on
this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a
company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be ef fective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-ef fect adjustment as of the date of adoption. W e are
evaluating the adoption method, as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures. As previously
disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with
significant online functionality for which we do not have VSOE for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current
accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly , we may be required
to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price
ratably over an estimated of fering period. This potential dif ference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this new
guidance. As accounting implementation guidance and clarifications regarding this matter are still evolving, we continue to evaluate the impact this guidance will
have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Leases
        In February 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on this
topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a
lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability ,
subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will
74
Table of Contents
result in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are lar gely similar to
those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is ef fective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at
the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. W e are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.
Statement of Cash Flows—Restricted Cash
        In November 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires
that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included
with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new
standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied retrospectively . Early adoption is permitted.
        We are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. W e expect there would be a significant impact to
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, as those years include, as an investing activity , the $3.6 billion
movement in restricted cash as a result of transferring cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that
cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and hence would not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
Item 7A.    QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
        Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
        We transact business in many dif ferent foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary
currencies include euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. T o the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens
against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions results in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income and
cash flows from our international operations. Similarly , our revenues, operating expenses, net income and cash flows will increase for our international operations
if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. W e
monitor currency volatility throughout the year .
        To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings and our foreign currency risk
related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts,
principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are
large and reputable commercial or investment banks.
75
Table of Contents
        The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
        For a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
        At December 31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges.
        At December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately
$489 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified $8 million of unrealized gains out of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and into
earnings due to dedesignating $250 million notional euro to U.S. dollar cash flow hedges when it was determined the hedged transaction would not occur . As a
result of the dedesignation, we entered into of fsetting foreign currency forward contracts. The dedesignated and of fsetting foreign currency forward contracts
remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $1 1 million as of December 31, 2015.
        For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were not material.
Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Designated as Hedges ("Cash Flow Hedges")
        At December 31, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $346 million. The fair value of these contracts was
$22 million of net unrealized gains with remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally , at December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of net realized but
unrecognized gains recorded within "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" associated with contracts that settled during the year but were deferred
and will be amortized into earnings along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
        At December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of all outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $381 million. The fair value of these contracts
was $4 million of net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015.
        During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no inef fectiveness relating to our Cash Flow Hedges. During the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015, the amount of pre-tax net realized gains associated with these contracts that were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and
into earnings was not material.
        In the absence of hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would
have resulted in potential declines of our net income of approximately $105 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign
currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however , all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may dif fer
materially .
Interest Rate Risk
        Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt under our credit agreement.
We do not currently use derivative
76
Table of Contents
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, a hypothetical interest rate change on our variable rate debt of one percent
(100 basis points) would have changed interest expense on an annual basis by approximately $27 million and $19 million, respectively . This estimate does not
include a change in interest income from our investment portfolio that may result from such a hypothetical interest rate change nor does it include the ef fects of
other actions that we may take in the future to mitigate this risk or any changes in our financial structure. Refer to Note 1 1 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures regarding terms and interest rates associated with our debt obligations.
        Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because
short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash
equivalents, or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer -term securities. Conversely , the fair value of such a portfolio
is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer -term securities. At December 31, 2016, our $3.25 billion of cash and cash equivalents was
comprised primarily of money market funds.
        The Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016, there was no material interest rate risk
exposure to the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as of that date.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
        Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to reasonably ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive of ficer and principal
financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in
our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which
we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible
future events.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, conducted
an evaluation of the ef fectiveness, as of December 31, 2016, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of December 31, 2016.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
        On February 23, 2016, we completed our acquisition of King. The acquired business constituted approximately 7% of total assets and 23% of net revenues
of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. In accordance with SEC staf f guidance permitting a company to
exclude an acquired business from management's assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition
is completed, we excluded King from our assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
        The ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
        There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially af fected, or are
reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
        To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:
        In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in
shareholders' equity and of cash flows, present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly , in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol—Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations
of the T readway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. W e conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether ef fective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
        As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for income taxes related to share-
based payments and the manner in which it classifies certain items in the statement of cash flows in 2016.
        A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject

to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
        As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded King Digital
Entertainment ("King") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because it was acquired by the Company in a
purchase business combination during 2016. W e have also excluded King from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. King is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, Inc. whose total assets and total net revenues represent 7% and 23%, respectively , of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company . All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
F-9
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that af fect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer from
these estimates and assumptions.
        Certain reclassifications have been made to prior -year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
        The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional
evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.
Cost of revenues presentation
        In periods prior to the second quarter of 2016, we presented cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in four financial statement
captions: "Cost of sales—product costs," "Cost of sales—online," "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," and "Cost of sales—intellectual property
licenses." Since the second quarter of 2016, we have revised the presentation in our consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of
revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows:
        Cost of revenues—product sales:
(i) "Product costs"—includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing royalties,
net of volume discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. W e generally recognize volume discounts when they are
earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones). 
(ii) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the
capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales
revenues.
        Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other revenues:
(i) "Game operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and server costs,
platform provider fee, and payment provider fees. 
(ii) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released,
at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable
to subscription, licensing and other revenues.
        Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
        We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be "Cash and
cash equivalents."
Investment Securities
        Investments designated as available-for -sale securities are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is
estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the Company's available-for -
sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss)."
        Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within "Other current assets."
In addition, investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within "Other current assets" if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations.
        The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in "Interest and other
expense (income), net" in our consolidated statements of operations.
Cash in Escrow
        As part of the King Acquisition, we were required to deposit $3.56 billion in cash to be held in an escrow account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the
King Acquisition, or (ii) the termination of the transaction agreement. The cash was not accessible to the Company for operating cash needs as its use had been
administratively restricted for use in the consummation of the King Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, we recorded the balance of the escrow account as a non-
current asset, "Cash in escrow ," in our consolidated balance sheet.
Financial Instruments
        The carrying amounts of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable, net of allowances," "Accounts payable," and "Accrued expenses and other
liabilities" approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in the United States of America ("U.S.") treasuries, government
agency securities, and corporate bonds, if any , are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on
the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.
        The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies,
subjecting us to foreign currency risk. T o mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and
earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter
into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for
our currency derivative contracts are lar ge and reputable commercial or investment banks.
F-11

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        We assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic 815 to
determine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the
prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. W e report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets,"
"Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets based on the prevailing exchange
rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the relevant period.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
        For foreign currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate risk from foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings that are not
designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within "General and administrative
expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our consolidated statements of operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.
        For foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into to hedge forecasted intercompany cash flows that are subject to foreign currency risk and which
have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the ef fectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing
basis and determine if the hedges are ef fective at providing of fsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company records the ef fective portion of
changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and subsequently reclassifies the related amount of
accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within "General and administrative" or "Net revenues" when the hedged item impacts earnings, consistent with
the nature and timing of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash
flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows. W e measure hedge inef fectiveness, if any , and if it is determined that a
derivative has ceased to be a highly ef fective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.
Concentration of Credit Risk
        Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company's cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts receivable
balances.
        Our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments
and governmental or ganizations, financial institutions and industrial companies.
        Our customer base includes retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty
stores in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. W e perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. W e
generally do not require collateral or other security from our customers.
        For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two customers, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), and Apple, Inc., who each accounted for 13%
of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had two customers, Sony and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), who accounted for 12% and 10%,
respectively , of net revenues. W e did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.

        We had three customers—Sony , Microsoft, and W al-Mart Stores, Inc.—who accounted for 17%, 10%, and 10%, respectively , of consolidated gross
receivables at December 31, 2016, and 18%, 13%, and 1 1%, respectively , of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015.
Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined
to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and
tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is
established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development
cycle. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable
that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized
costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized
costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to
software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately to "Product development."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months to approximately two years.
        Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software,
technology , music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder ,
we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively , for a single product. Prior to a product's
release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses." Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product
development" in the period of cancellation.
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization,
and intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed
property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period
beyond one year , the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year .
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have
been released in prior periods, the
F-13

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is
to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable
technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated
performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further , as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for
multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property , whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or
television series based on the intellectual property , and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property .
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised
forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be
lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment char ge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and timing of
expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.
Inventories
        Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor , and freight-in and are stated at the lower of cost
(weighted-average method) or net realizable value. Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.
Long-Lived Assets
        Pr operty and Equipment.     Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life ( i.e., 25 to
33 years for buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, of fice furniture and other equipment) of the asset. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost
and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs
are expensed as incurred.
        Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.     We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC T opic 350. Under ASC T opic 350, goodwill is considered to
have an indefinite life, and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there is no foreseeable limits on the periods of time
over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, as
well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. W e perform our annual impairment testing at
December 31.
F-14

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. W e have determined our reporting units based on the guidance within ASC
Subtopic 350-20. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. W e test goodwill for possible impairment by
first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair
value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting
unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, which is equal to the amount by which the
recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after assessing the fair value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. W e
have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows,
which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.
        We test indefinite-lived acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. W e have determined that
no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our
best estimate of future performance at this time.
        Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic
conditions, could result in future impairment char ges.
        Amortizable Intangible Assets.     Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and amortized over the estimated
useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received.
        We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally
requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. W e considered certain events and
circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets,
may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of
the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and changes in our business
strategy . If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate
disposition of these assets to determine whether an impairment exists. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying values and the
undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. W e did
not record an impairment char ge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Revenue Recognition
        We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer , the collection of our
fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date"
(which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product
is sold to
F-15

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
the customer . Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with the specific revenue-
producing transaction between us and our customer , such as sales and value-added taxes.
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with ASC T opic 605. These revenue arrangements
include product sales consisting of both software, service (such as ongoing hosting arrangements), and hardware deliverables (such as peripherals or other
ancillary collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software).
        When a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, we allocate revenue to each
element based on a selling price hierarchy . The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor -specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-
party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element
arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software
deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy . Further , if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the
software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.
        As noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP . We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required
using BESP for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the
actual price char ged by the Company for deliverables that the Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar
products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).
Product Sales
        Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. W e recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. W ith respect to
digital full-game downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay . Revenues from product sales are recognized after
deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and
product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other
consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national circular ad, are
reflected as sales and marketing expenses when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate
the fair value of the benefit.

Products with Online Functionality or Hosted Service Arrangements
        For our software products with online functionality or that are part of a hosted service agreement, we evaluate whether that online functionality constitutes a
more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on
(including downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of the online functionality's importance to gameplay , we
consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. In addition, VSOE of fair value does not exist for the online functionality
of some products, as we do not separately char ge for this component. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any such
title (including downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer the cost of
revenues for the title and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are initially deferred include manufacturing
costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.
        For our software products with online functionality that we consider to be incidental to the overall product of fering and are inconsequential deliverables, we
recognize the related revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.
        For our World of W arcraft  boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related subscription
service revenues ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. Revenues attributed
to the sale of World of W arcraft  boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and
other value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."
Subscription Revenues
        Subscription revenues are mostly derived from World of W arcraft . World of W arcraft  is a game that is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally
sold on a subscription-only basis.
        For World of W arcraft , after the first month of free usage that is included with the World of W arcraft  boxed software, the World of W arcraft  end user may
enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions via boxed software and prepaid subscription
cards, as well as prepaid subscriptions sales, are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the
subscription period. V alue-added service revenues associated with subscriptions are recognized ratably over the estimated service periods.
Licensing Revenues
        In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees pay the
Company a royalty . We recognize these royalties as revenues based on usage by the end user and over the estimated service period when we
F-17
Table of Contents

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
have continuing service obligations. W e recognize any upfront licensing fees received over the term of the agreements.
        With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenues are generally
recognized upon delivery of a master copy if all other performance obligations have been completed or over the estimated service period when we have
continuing service obligations. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, persuasive evidence of an arrangement
must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.
Other Revenues
        Other revenues primarily include revenues from digital downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions and the licensing of
intellectual property other than software to third-parties.
        Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the
sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a
player uses the virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency . Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are also recognized as revenues when a player
uses the virtual goods. W e categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a
specific player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent
goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the
period of time the goods are available to the player , which is generally the estimated service period of the game.
        Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties are recorded upon the receipt of licensee statements, or upon the
receipt of cash, provided the license period has begun and all performance obligations have been completed.
Estimated Service Period
        We determine the estimated service period for players of our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted average number of
days between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the
weighted-average number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends, the service periods of
our previously released games, and the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours, to the extent they are publicly available.
Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage patterns and
therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months.
Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, and Doubtful Accounts
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other
F-18

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated with the goal of
ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.
We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and
payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may also consider other factors, including achievement of sell-
through performance tar gets in certain instances, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory , and other market factors.
        Significant management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenues must be made and used when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. W e estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer . The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title:
historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life
cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-
hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the
performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality ,
and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor , or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. There may be material dif ferences in the amount
and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's
assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.
        Similarly , management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze
the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes
in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain suf ficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of
these criteria would af fect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence
        We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. W e write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined
primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the dif ference between the cost of the inventory and net
realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently dif ficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss
recognition, a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase
in that newly established basis.
Shipping and Handling
        Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation char ges incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in
"Cost of revenues—product costs."
Advertising Expenses
        We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and char ged to expense when the
related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $641 million, $523 million, and
$495 million, respectively , and are included in "Sales and marketing" in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which the temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do not
meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
        We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. W e recognize interest
and penalties, if any , related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Income tax expense."
Foreign Currency T ranslation
        All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate in ef fect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments
are reflected as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in shareholders' equity .

Earnings Per Common Share
        "Basic earnings per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the periods presented. "Diluted earnings per share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents
are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However , potential common
shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a
period in which a net loss is recorded.
        When we determine whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, unvested share-based awards which
include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed earnings. W ith
participating securities, we are required to calculate basic and diluted earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method. The two-class method
excludes from the earnings per common share calculation any dividends paid or owed to participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be
attributable to participating securities.
Share-Based Payments
        We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for a given
grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based
payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
        We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is af fected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant,
reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock rights holder will not participate. Certain
restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For
performance-based restricted stock rights, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. W e
amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately
vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock rights, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology
and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte
Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility
that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-
F-21
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However , the number
of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
        For share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative
catch-up adjustment for changes in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.
Loss Contingencies
        ASC T opic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. W e record an accrual
for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential
loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any
other amount within the range. Moreover , even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is
reasonably possible ( i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.

10. Fair V alue Measur ements
        F ASB literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of "unobservable inputs." The three
levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
• Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and 
• Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities,
including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
Fair V alue Measurements on a Recurring Basis
        The table below segregates all of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most appropriate level within
the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date, generally including money market funds, treasury bills,

Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Designated as Hedges ("Cash Flow Hedges")
        At December 31, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $346 million. The fair value of these contracts was
$22 million of net unrealized gains with remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally , at December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of net realized but
unrecognized gains recorded within "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" associated with contracts that settled during the year but were deferred
and will be amortized into earnings along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
        At December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of all outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $381 million. The fair value of these contracts
was $4 million of net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015.
        During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no inef fectiveness relating to our Cash Flow Hedges. During the years ended December 31,

Fair V alue Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis
        We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

Credit Facilities

"Original T erm Loan"), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Original Revolver"). As of December 31, 2015, as a result of repayments and
prepayments during the prior periods, we had $1.9 billion outstanding under the Original T erm Loan.
        In conjunction with the King Acquisition, we entered into three amendments to the Credit Agreement (the "Amendments"). The Amendments, among other
things, provided for an incremental tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion. The proceeds were provided on
February 23, 2016 and were used to fund the King Acquisition. On March 31, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement which provided
for an incremental tranche of term loans "A" in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million (together with the $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A", the
"Original TLA"); the proceeds from the incremental borrowing were used to make a voluntary prepayment on our Original T erm Loan on March 31, 2016. In
addition to this prepayment, we made voluntary prepayments on our Original T erm Loan of $500 million and $800 million on February 25 and May 26, 2016,
respectively .

        On August 23, 2016 we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Fifth Amendment") that provided for a new tranche of term loans "A"
of approximately $2.9 billion (the "2016 TLA") and an amended revolving credit facility of $250 million (the "Revolver" and together with the 2016 TLA, the
"Credit Facilities"). The proceeds from the 2016 TLA were primarily used to pay of f the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Original T erm Loan of
$319 million and the Original TLA of $2.5 billion. As a result of the payments to extinguish the Original T erm Loan and Original TLA, we wrote-of f unamortized
discount and deferred financing costs of $10 million, which is included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statements of operations. The
remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs were deferred, along with new fees paid to the 2016 TLA lenders, and will continue to be amortized
over the maturity of the 2016 TLA. As a result of the Fifth Amendment, both the 2016 TLA and the Revolver became unsecured loans. As described below , the
2016 TLA was fully prepaid in February 2017. The Revolver is scheduled to nature on August 23, 2021. Debt discounts and deferred financing costs incurred in
relation to the Fifth Amendment were not material.
        Borrowings under the Revolver may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed by the Company , and are available for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. Up to $50 million of the Revolver may be used for letters of credit. T o date, we have not drawn on the Revolver . Borrowings under the 2016
TLA and the Revolver will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the
prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London Interbank Of fered Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of one month beginning
on such day plus 1.00%, or (b) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest mar gin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate will be subject
to an ef fective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest mar gin for borrowings under the 2016 TLA and Revolver will range from 1.125% to 2.00% for LIBOR
borrowings and from 0.125% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's credit ratings. At
December 31, 2016, the 2016 TLA bore interest at 2.02%.
        The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the 2016 TLA commencing on September 30, 2016,
with increases to 1.250% starting on September 30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on September 30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the 2016 TLA's
scheduled maturity date of August 23, 2021. On September 30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, we made a voluntary
prepayment on our 2016 TLA of $167 million. These payments satisfied the required quarterly principal repayments through December 31, 2018.
        The Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company's Consolidated T otal Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to
exceed (i) 4.00:1.00 on or prior to March 31, 2017, and (ii) thereafter , 3.50:1.00. The Fifth Amendment contains other covenants that are customary for issuers
with similar credit ratings. A violation of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event
of default, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated, and the lenders' commitments to extend credit under the Credit
Agreement may be terminated. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of other
outstanding unsecured debt, including the debt holders described below , to accelerate the repayment of such obligations. The Company was in compliance with
the terms of the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2016.

        As of December 31, 2016, the Credit Facilities were guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, whose assets represented approximately 67% of our
consolidated assets.
        On February 3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment to our Credit Agreement. The amendment (i) provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" in an
aggregate principal amount of $2.55 billion (the "2017 TLA") and (ii) released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantee provided under
the Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA, together with additional cash funds on hand, were used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA outstanding under the
Credit Agreement immediately prior to the ef fectiveness of the sixth amendment, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017
TLA, other than the absence of guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA.
        On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding debt during 2017. During February
2017, we made voluntary prepayments on our term loans of $500 million, inclusive of $139 million used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA as discussed above. The
voluntary prepayment satisfied the remaining required quarterly principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement.
Unsecured Senior Notes
        On September 19, 2013, we issued, at par , $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "Original 2021 Notes") and $750 million
of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the Original 2021 Notes, the "Notes") in a private of fering to
qualified institutional buyers made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
        The Original 2021 Notes became eligible for redemption on September 15, 2016 (and, as described below , were redeemed on October 19, 2016). W e may
redeem the 2023 Notes on or after September 15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes prior to September 15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof plus a "make-whole premium" and accrued and unpaid interest. Further , upon the occurrence of one or more qualified equity of ferings, we may also
redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such of ferings.
        On September 19, 2016, we issued $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "New 2021 Notes") and $850 million of 3.4%
unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the "2026 Notes" and, together with the New 2021 Notes, the "New Notes") in a private of fering made in accordance
with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.
        In connection with the issuance of the New Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), among the
Company , the subsidiary guarantors, and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the New Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required
to use commercially reasonable ef forts to within one year of the issue date of the New Notes, among other things, (1) file a registration statement with respect to
an of fer to exchange each series of the New Notes for new notes that are substantially identical in all material respects, (except for the provisions relating to the
transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and (2) cause the registration statement to be declared ef fective by the SEC under the Securities Act.

        We may redeem some or all of the New 2021 Notes prior to August 15, 2021 and some or all of the 2026 Notes prior to June 15, 2026, in each case at a price
equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem the New
2021 Notes on or after August 15, 2021, and the 2026 Notes on or after June 15, 2026, in each case in whole or in part on any one or more occasions and at a
price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.
        Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to of fer to repurchase the 2023 Notes and New Notes at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the 2023
Notes and New Notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.
        The 2023 Notes and New Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu  in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and
future senior indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities described above. As of December 31, 2016, the 2023 Notes and New Notes were guaranteed on a senior
basis by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the indentures underlying the 2023 Notes and New Notes, the guarantees by certain subsidiaries
were automatically released when the 2017 TLA guarantees were removed in connection with the sixth amendment to the Credit Agreement. The 2023 Notes and
New Notes are not secured and are ef fectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future indebtedness that is secured.
        On October 19, 2016, we redeemed the Original 2021 Notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million,
comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and write of f of unamortized discount and financing costs of $19 million. This loss is included in "Loss on
extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statements of operations.
        The 2023 Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens,
payment of dividends, sales of assets, and certain mer ger and consolidation transactions. The New Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in
certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain mer ger or consolidation
transactions. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2023 Notes and the New Notes as of December 31, 2016.
        Interest on the 2023 Notes and New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year , and is recorded within "Accrued
expenses and other liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016, we had interest payable of $13 million and $12 million, related to the
2023 Notes and New Notes, respectively . As of December 31, 2015, we had interest payable of $38 million related to the Notes.
Interest expense and financing costs
        Fees and discounts associated with the closing of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and is
amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our consolidated statements of
operations.
        In connection with the debt financing for the Original TLA and New Notes of fering, we incurred $38 million and $17 million of discounts and financing
costs, respectively , that were capitalized and

Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans
        On June 5, 2014, our shareholders approved the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") and the 2014 Plan became ef fective. The
2014 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation
Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan.
        While the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our share-based compensation program for the most part currently
utilizes a combination of options and restricted stock units. The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a
period of three to five years, and expire ten years from the grant date. Restricted stock units either have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their
entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three to five years, or vest only if certain performance measures are met. In
addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on
the date the award is granted, as reported on NASDAQ.
F-36(2) Net revenues from mobile and ancillary includes revenues from handheld, mobile and tablet devices, as well as non-platform

14. Shar e-Based Payments (Continued)
        Upon the ef fective date of the 2014 Plan, we ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively , the "Prior Plans"), although such
plans will remain in ef fect and continue to govern outstanding awards. Additionally , in connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding
options and awards with respect to King shares that were unvested as of the King Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to
shares of the Company's common stock (see Note 21 for further discussion). As part of the conversion, we assumed King's equity incentive plan (the "King Plan")
and amended the King Plan to convert it to a plan with respect to shares of the Company's common stock for the King shares assumed. No future shares can be
granted from King Plan.
        As of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further , increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares relating to awards
outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (a) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (b) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or
(c) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (ii) if the exercise price of any option
outstanding under any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by
withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned, the number
of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (iii) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the
difference between the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of
December 31, 2016, we had approximately 34 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection
with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.
Fair V alue V aluation Assumptions
Valuation of Stock Options
        We use a binomial-lattice model to value our stock options. W e estimate expected future changes in model inputs during an option's contractual term. The
inputs required by our binomial-lattice model include expected volatility , risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as
measures of employees' cancellations, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior . Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank-specific
termination rates. These termination rates, in turn, were used to model the number of options that are expected to vest and post-vesting termination behavior .
Employee rank-specific estimates of expected time-to-exercise ("ETTE") were used to reflect employee exercise behavior . ETTE was estimated by using
statistical procedures to first estimate the probability of exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option surviving to that time period, and
then using those probabilities to determine the ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting termination
behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of these measures that were estimated from historical data.

        The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions, the weighted-average fair value at grant date using the binomial-lattice model, and the range
of expected stock price volatilities:
Expected life
        The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is an output
from the binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A
binomial-lattice model can be viewed as assuming that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise multiple, of
which the multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.
Risk-free interest rate
        As is the case for volatility , the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a
binomial-lattice model, the risk-free interest rate reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next ("forward rate"), as opposed
to the interest rate from the grant date to the given time period ("spot rate").
Volatility
        To estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods that consider the implied volatility based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded
options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility , the historical volatility of our common shares during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term
volatility , and a statistical model to estimate the transition or "mean reversion" from short-term volatility to long-term volatility .
Dividend yield
        The expected dividend yield assumption for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on our historical and expected future amount
of dividend payouts.

        As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 is
based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical
experience and revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
Valuation of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")
        The fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted is based upon the closing price of the Company's stock price on the date of grant reduced by the
present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting.
Accuracy of Fair V alue Estimates
        We developed the assumptions used in the models above, including model inputs and measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting termination
behavior . Our ability to accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability
to accurately forecast model inputs as long as 10 years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility , risk-free rate,
dividend yield, and employee termination rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that
are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller . Unfortunately , it is dif ficult to determine
if this is the case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other share-based instruments.

        For options assumed in the King Acquisition, 0.7 million of the options are based on performance conditions which do not have an accounting grant date as
of December 31, 2016, as there is not a mutual understanding between the Company and the employee of the performance terms.
        The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e. the dif ference between our closing stock price on the last
trading day of the period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the closing stock price is greater than the exercise price) that would
have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market value of our stock.
The total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $161 million, $125 million, and $1 17 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively . The total grant date fair value of options vested was $40 million, $19 million, and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and
2014, respectively .
        At December 31, 2016, $88 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.73 years.
RSU Activity
        We grant RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock. V esting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders' continued employment
with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our performance-based RSUs
include a range of shares that may be released at vesting which are above or below the tar geted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the grant
date performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested RSUs will be forfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise
deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.
        The following table summarizes our RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2016, with performance-based RSUs presented at the maximum potential
shares that could be earned and issued at vesting (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):
        Certain of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2016, as there is not a mutual understanding between the
Company and the employee of the performance terms. Generally , these performance terms relate to revenue and operating income performance for future years
where the performance goals have not yet been set. As of December 31, 2016, there were 5.1 million performance-based RSUs outstanding for which the

has not been set, of which 3.6 million were 2016 grants. Accordingly , no grant date fair value was established and the weighted average grant date fair value
calculated above for 2016 grants excludes these RSUs.
        At December 31, 2016, approximately $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.65 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $56 million was related to performance-based RSUs, which is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.85 years. The total grant date fair value of vested RSUs was $123 million, $93 million and $92 million for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively .
        The income tax benefit from stock option exercises and RSUs was $134 million, $109 million, and $89 million for the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015, and 2014, respectively .

        For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions exceeded the amounts
recorded based on grant date fair value. During the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-
based payments. The standard, among other things, requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the
statement of operations (see Note 22). As a result, $81 million was recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in 2016. Conversely , in 2015 and 2014,
$65 million and $30 million, respectively , were credited to shareholders' equity .
        The items accounting for the dif ference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the income tax expense (benefit) at
the ef fective tax rate for each of the years are as follows (amounts in millions):
        The Company's tax rate is af fected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction,
and the jurisdictions with a statutory tax rate less than the U.S. rate of 35%.
        In 2013, in connection with the Purchase T ransaction, we assumed certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of
approximately $760 million, which represent a potential tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The utilization of such NOL carryforwards will be subject to
certain annual limitations and will begin to expire in 2021. The Company also obtained indemnification from V ivendi against losses attributable to the
disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to $200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending
on or prior to December 31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was recorded upon the close of the Purchase T ransaction. As of
December 31, 2016, we had utilized approximately $657 million of the original NOL and had recorded an indemnification asset of $200 million in "Other assets."
Correspondingly , the same amount was recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in "T reasury stock." In each of the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we utilized $326 million and $180 million of the NOL and recognized a corresponding reserve of $1 14 million and
$63 million in each of those years ended, respectively .

        Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax ef fects of temporary dif ferences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):
        As of December 31, 2016, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $240 million and $137 million for federal and state purposes, respectively , which begin
to expire in fiscal 2025. The tax credit carryforwards are presented in "Deferred tax assets" net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of
uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had state NOL carryforwards of $9 million which begin to expire in fiscal 2027. Through our foreign operations, we had
approximately $6 million in NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2016, attributed mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely .
        We evaluate our deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and tax credits, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. W e assess whether a
valuation allowance should be established or released based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard. Realization of
the U.S. deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of suf ficient taxable income. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to
evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not

that the net carrying value of the U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there are no valuation allowances on deferred tax
assets.
        Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $5,127 million at December 31,
2016. Deferred income taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration. Determination of the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings is not practicable because of the complexity of the hypothetical calculation. In the event of a
distribution of these earnings to the U.S. in the form of a dividend, we may be subject to both foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes net of allowable
foreign tax credits.
        Activision Blizzard's tax years 2009 through 2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The IRS is
currently examining the Company's federal tax returns for the 2009 through 201 1 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the
review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a
different allocation of profits and losses under the Company's transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our
provision for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter . The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits
pending. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for the King Acquisition, the Company assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related
to the transfer pricing on King tax years occurring prior to the King Acquisition. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and
taxing authorities with respect to King's transfer pricing, which could result in a dif ferent allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions.
        Vivendi Games' results for the period from January 1, 2008 through July 9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local
income tax returns filed by V ivendi or its af filiates, while V ivendi Games' results for the period from July 10, 2008 through December 31, 2008 are included in
the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. IRS Appeals proceedings concerning V ivendi Games'
tax return for the 2008 tax year were concluded during July 2016 but that year remains open to examination by other major taxing authorities. The resolution of
the 2008 IRS Appeals process did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
        Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by tax authorities in various
jurisdictions, including France. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such
proceedings may have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in
which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse
assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies.
        As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $846 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $812 million would af fect our ef fective tax rate,
if recognized. A reconciliation of total gross

unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 is as follows (amounts in millions):
        We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in "Income tax expense". As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately
$71 million and $41 million, respectively , of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and
2014, we recorded $17 million, $10 million, and $5 million, respectively , of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.
        The final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the
probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate

16. Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Shar e
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in millions, except per share data):
        Certain of our unvested restricted stock rights (including certain restricted stock units and performance shares) met the definition of participating securities
as they participate in earnings based on their rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Therefore, we are required to use the two-class method in our
computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, on a weighted-average basis, we had
outstanding unvested restricted stock rights with respect to 3 million, 8 million, and 15 million shares of common stock, respectively , that are participating in
earnings.
        Certain of our employee-related restricted stock rights and stock options are contingently issuable upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance
measures. These shares are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting
period. Approximately 8 million, 3 million, and 4 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2016, respectively , as their respective performance measures have not been met.
        Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would
be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded. Therefore, options to acquire 5 million, 1 million, and 2 million shares of common stock were
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively , as the ef fect of their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Letters of Credit
        As described in Note 1 1, a portion of our Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the availability of the Revolver . At
December 31, 2016, we did not have any letters of credit issued or outstanding under the Revolver .
Commitments
        In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our of fices, for
the development of products and for the rights to intellectual property . Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor , developer or
intellectual property holder , as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the
achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones. Further , these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property
holders typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on
sales of the related game. Additionally , in connection with certain intellectual property rights, acquisitions and development agreements, we commit to spend
specified amounts for marketing support for the game(s) which is (are) to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Assuming all
contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2016 are scheduled

Legal Proceedings
        We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with respect to
intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters,
and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not
expect them to have a material adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity .
Purchase T ransaction Matters
        In prior periods, the Company reported on litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction. During the period ended June 30, 2015, the cases were resolved and
dismissed with prejudice. As part of the resolution of the claims, we received a settlement payment of $202 million in July 2015 from V ivendi, ASAC LP , and our
insurers. W e recorded the settlement within "Shareholders' equity" in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
20. Related Party T ransactions
Transactions with V ivendi and Its Af filiates
        As part of the Business Combination in 2008, we entered into various transactions and agreements, including cash management services agreements, a tax
sharing agreement and an investor agreement, with V ivendi and its subsidiaries. In connection with the consummation of the Purchase T ransaction, we terminated
the cash management arrangements with V ivendi and amended our investor agreement with V ivendi. W e are also party to a number of agreements with
subsidiaries and other af filiates of V ivendi, including music licensing and distribution arrangements and promotional arrangements, none of which were impacted
by the Purchase T ransaction. None of these services, transactions, and agreements with V ivendi and its af filiates were material, either individually or in the
aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
        On May 28, 2014, V ivendi sold 41 million shares, reducing its ownership interest below 10%, and was no longer considered a related party as of
December 31, 2015. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, V ivendi sold its remaining shares of our common stock.
Transactions with ASAC's Af filiates
        In connection with the Purchase T ransaction, on October 1 1, 2013, we, ASAC LP and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly
entered into a stockholders agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement"). The Stockholders Agreement contains various agreements among the parties regarding
voting rights, transfer rights, and a standstill agreement, among other things. In connection with the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase
Transaction, the parties to the Stockholders Agreement amended that agreement on May 28, 2015.
        As of December 31, 2015, ASAC LP , held approximately 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at that
time. Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Of ficer, and Brian G. Kelly , Chairman of our Board of Directors, are the managers of ASAC II GP . On June 8, 2016,
ASAC GP distributed the approximately 141 million shares allocable to the limited partners of ASAC LP to those limited partners. On July 7, 2016, ASAC LP
distributed approximately

18 million of its remaining approximately 31 million shares to ASAC GP . On August 15, 2016, ASAC GP sold approximately 4 million shares of our common
stock and distributed 14 million shares pro rata to its members, consisting of trusts for the benefit of Messrs. Kotick and Kelly , which shares were ultimately sold
on that day for financial and estate-planning purposes. On August 19, 2016, ASAC LP distributed its remaining shares of common stock to ASAC GP , leaving
ASAC LP without any shares and ASAC GP  with approximately 13 million shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 2% of the outstanding
shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. On February 10, 2017, ASAC GP distributed its remaining shares. W e did not receive any proceeds from
any of the distributions or sales of the shares.
21. Acquisitions
King Digital Entertainment
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, purchasing all of its outstanding shares. As a result, King became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Activision Blizzard. King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as
Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are
included in our consolidated financial statements.
        We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in
interactive entertainment across console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth.
        The aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with
$3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company . The total aggregate purchase price for King was comprised of

(2) Represents the fair value of King's existing vested and unvested stock options and awards that were assumed and replaced with
Activision Blizzard equity or deferred cash awards. The purchase price includes the portion of fair value related to pre-
combination services. The fair value of the options and awards assumed was determined using binomial-lattice and Monte Carlo
models with the following assumptions: (a) volatility of 36%, (b) time-varying risk-free interest rates based on the U.S. T reasury
yield curves, (c) an expected

21. Acquisitions (Continued)
        We identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the King Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value
of approximately $2.7 billion to goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded certain immaterial measurement period adjustments to our
preliminary purchase price allocation based on additional analysis of facts and circumstances that existed as of the King Closing Date.
        The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):
        During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within
"General and administrative" in the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the debt financing that occurred on the King Closing Date, we
incurred $38 million of issuance costs that were capitalized and recorded within "Long-term debt, net" on our consolidated balance sheet. The amortization of
these capitalized costs was not material to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Share-Based Compensation
        In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and awards that were unvested as of the King Closing Date were
converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in
accordance with the transaction agreement. As a result, replacement equity options and awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively , were issued. The portion
of the fair value related to

pre-combination services of $76 million was included in the purchase price, while the remaining fair value will be recognized over the remaining service periods.
As of December 31, 2016, the future expense for the converted King options and awards was approximately $40 million, which will be recognized over a
weighted average service period of approximately 1.6 years.
        The remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an
escrow-like account with the cash releases to occur based on the awards' original vesting schedule upon future service being rendered. The cash associated with
these awards is recorded in "Other current assets" and "Other assets" in our consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination
services of $22 million was included in the purchase price while the remaining fair value of approximately $9 million will be recognized over the remaining
service periods. A portion of the cash proceeds placed in an escrow-like account were released to award holders over the course of 2016, but the amount was not
material.
Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquir ed and Goodwill
        The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired from King were estimated using an income approach, with the exception of the customer base,
which was estimated using a cost approach. The fair value of the intangibles using the income approach was determined with the following key assumptions: (a) a
weighted average cost of capital of 13%, (b) long-term revenue decay rates ranging from 0% to 65%, and (c) royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 8%. The fair
value of the intangibles using the cost approach was based on amounts that would be required to replace the asset ( i.e., replacement cost).
        The Internally-developed franchises, Customer base, Developed software, and T rade name intangible assets will be amortized to "Cost of revenues—
subscription, licensing, and other revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," "Sales and marketing," "Cost of revenues—
subscription, licensing, and other revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," and "General and administrative," respectively .
The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.
        The $2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive
entertainment provider in the mobile sector , future franchises, and technology , as well as the management team's proven ability to create future games and
franchises. Approximately $620 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.
Contingent Liabilities Assumed
        As a result of the King Acquisition, we assumed contingent liabilities related to contingent consideration associated with King's previous acquisitions of
Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live, Inc. The remaining contingent consideration for Non Stop Games Oy is linked to amounts generated from games launched by
Nonstop Games Oy over a specified period. The range of the potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Company could be required to make
under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to $84 million. The remaining contingent consideration for Z2Live, Inc. is linked to amounts generated
from specific games launched by Z2Live, Inc. within a defined period. The potential range of undiscounted future payments that the

Company could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to $75 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration
arrangement at the King Closing date and as of December 31, 2016, for Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live, Inc. was immaterial.
King Net Revenue and Earnings
        The amount of net revenue and earnings attributable to King in the Company's consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31,
2016, are included in the table below . The amounts presented represent the net revenues and earnings after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of
amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues.
Pro Forma Financial Information
        The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and King, on a pro forma basis, as
though the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information presented includes the ef fects of adjustments related to
amortization char ges from acquired intangible assets, employee compensation from replacement equity awards issued in the King Acquisition and the profit
sharing bonus plan established as part of the King Acquisition, and interest expense from the new debt incurred in connection with the King Acquisition, among
other adjustments. W e also adjusted for Activision Blizzard and King non-recurring acquisition-related costs of approximately $74 million incurred for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 were adjusted to include these char ges.
        The unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of

22. Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
Share-based compensation
        In June 2014, the F ASB issued new guidance related to share-based compensation. The new standard requires that a performance tar get that af fects vesting,
and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance tar get should not be reflected in
estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes
probable that the performance tar get will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has
already been rendered. W e adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2016, and applied it prospectively . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Consolidations
        In February 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a
variable interest entity must be consolidated. W e adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard requires an entity to
present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be
reported as interest expense. W e adopted this change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2016, and applied it retrospectively for each period presented. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Internal-Use Softwar e
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer's accounting for fees paid in cloud
computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud
arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of
other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service
contract. W e adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016, and applied it prospectively . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations
        In September 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a
measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, on provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business
combination be recognized in the reporting period the adjustment is identified. The standard also
F-55
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
22. Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements (Continued)
requires separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by
line item. Prior to the issuance of the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively . We adopted this new standard as of
January 1, 2016, and applied it prospectively . No measurement period adjustments impacting earnings occurred as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Share-Based Payments
        In March 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other things:
• requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of
operations and that the tax ef fects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur; 
• requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and 
• permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as
currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur .
        We elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. As part of the
adoption, we made certain elections, including the following:
• to apply the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods
presented; and 
• to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.
        As a result of the adoption, we recognized excess tax benefits of $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further , given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of
cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased by $67 million and
$39 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively . The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.
Statement of Cash Flows
        In August 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires,
among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as
opposed to operating activities as is required under existing guidance. W e elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2016 and applied it
retrospectively . As a result of the adoption of this standard, our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the
$63 million premium payment from the October 19, 2016 redemption of our Original

December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
Revenue r ecognition
        In May 2014, the F ASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on
this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a
company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be ef fective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-ef fect adjustment as of the date of adoption. W e are
evaluating the adoption method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures. As previously
disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with
significant online functionality for which we do not have VSOE for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current
accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly , we may be required
to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price
ratably over an estimated of fering period. This potential dif ference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this new
guidance. As accounting implementation guidance and clarifications regarding this matter is still evolving, we continue to evaluate the impact this guidance will
have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Leases
        In February 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on this
topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a
lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability ,
subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, while
finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are lar gely similar to those applied in current lease
accounting. The standard is ef fective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is
permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented. W e are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory
        In July 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be
measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
should be applied prospectively . Early adoption is permitted. The impact this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
Financial Instruments
        In January 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard,
amongst other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and
recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily
determinable fair values. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a
cumulative-ef fect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity investments without readily
determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. W e are
evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Statement of Cash Flows—Restricted Cash
        In November 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires
that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included
with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new
standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied retrospectively . Early adoption is permitted.
        We are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. W e expect there would be a significant impact to
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, as those years include, as an investing activity , the $3.6 billion
movement in restricted cash as a result of transferring cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that
cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and hence would not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
Goodwill
        In January 2017, the F ASB issued new guidance which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if any entity for goes a Step 0 test, an
entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as

determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment char ge, if any , for the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is ef fective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and should be applied prospectively . Early adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of
adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

(1) During the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based
payments. The standard, among other things, requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax
expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations (see Note 22). The adoption of the standard impacted our
previously reported results for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. As a result of the adoption of this standard,
our net income, basic earnings per share, and diluted earnings per share increased by $24 million, $0.03, and $0.03, respectively ,

SECTION 1.0 - GENERAL
 
1.1                               Purpose of the Plan
 
King adopted this Plan, before it became a separate publicly traded company, to aid it in attracting, retaining and motivating employees, directors
and consultants of King and the Associated Companies who were expected to contribute to the success of such entities by offering them incentives
that allowed them to participate in future growth in value of Ordinary Shares. The Plan was assumed by the Company, as of the Acquisition Effective
Time, in connection with the Transaction Agreement and is being continued by the Company after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in the Transaction Agreement solely in respect of awards in respect of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time which are assumed by the Company and converted into Awards in respect of the Company’s Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of the Transaction Agreement.  No new awards will be made following the Acquisition Effective Time
notwithstanding any other term set forth herein.
 
1.2                               Types of Awards
 
The Plan allowed for the grant of the following Awards: Options, Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), Restricted Share Awards, Restricted Stock
Units (RSU) Awards, Unrestricted Stock Unit Awards and Performance Awards.
 
1.3                               Effective Date
 
The Plan was approved by the board of directors of King and by its shareholders on 6 March 2014 and became effective on the Effective Date.  The
Plan was assumed by the Company as of the Acquisition Effective Time.  From and after the Acquisition Effective Time, the Shares available for
issuance in respect of Awards granted hereunder (including Substitute Awards) are shares of Common Stock, and sections 3.0.  4.0, and 6.0 through
13.0 of the Plan are retained solely to the extent necessary or appropriate to understand and administer the terms of the Awards related to King
awards in respect of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, which are assumed by the Company pursuant
to the terms of the Transaction Agreement.
 
1.4                               Capitalized Terms
 
Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere in the text are defined in Section 25.
 
 
SECTION 2.0 - SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
 
2.1                               Number of Shares
 
The number of Shares of Common Stock that are available for issuance hereunder from the Acquisition Effective Time is the number of Ordinary
Shares that were issuable in respect of awards granted by King prior to, and outstanding immediately prior to, the Acquisition Effective Time which
are assumed by the Company and converted into Awards in respect of the Company’s Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the
Transaction Agreement, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.  Any additional Ordinary Shares that were available for issuance under the Plan
immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time shall no longer be available for issuance hereunder following the Acquisition Effective Time,
and no Shares of Common Stock shall be issuable in respect thereof.  No additional Shares shall become available for issuance hereunder following
the Acquisition Effective Time.
 
2.2                               Lapsed, Returned Awards
 
Shares that are subject to Awards that lapse, expire or are forfeited or otherwise cancelled following the Acquisition Effective Time shall not again
become available for Awards hereunder.
 
2.3                               Substitute Awards — Acquisition by the Company
 
Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, any option or other equity award in respect of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Acquisition Effective Time that (i) was granted pursuant to an individual award agreement (and not under the Plan) prior to the Effective Date and
(ii) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, was to be assumed by the Company and converted into an option or another award in respect of Shares of
Common Stock, shall be deemed to have been converted into a Substitute Award in respect of the Company’s Common Stock under this Plan.  Any
Substitute Award shall have the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the underlying individual award agreement by which King
effected the award and in place immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, subject to any amendments which were to come into effect at
the Acquisition Effective Time, including such amendments as are necessary or appropriate to reflect the assumption, and the conversion, thereof
into a right in respect of the Common Stock and as otherwise may be required to reflect the change of control of King.  The amendments
contemplated pursuant to the foregoing sentence include: (i) applying the Exchange Ratio to determine (x) the number of Shares of the Common
Stock to which such Substitute Award relates and (y) the exercise price per Share in respect of any Substitute Award that is an option to acquire
Shares, (ii) substituting the Company for King in all
 
2
 
respects in regard to any such individual award agreement, including authorizing the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, to perform any
action or to exercise any authority or discretion reserved to the King compensation committee or the King board of directors; and (iii) where
applicable, any amendments made to individual award agreements pursuant to the AB Executive Service Agreements (as defined in the Transaction
Agreement).
 
2.4                               Minimum Share Reserve
 
At all times the Company shall reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares as shall reasonably be required to satisfy all outstanding
Awards.
 
2.5                               Individual Limit
 
Prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, grants of Awards in respect of Ordinary Shares were subject to individual limits.  Such limits provided that
no Participant could be granted Awards in the aggregate in any calendar year in respect of more than 1,250,000 Ordinary Shares, except that a new
Employee (including a new Employee who was also hired as an officer or director of King or any Associated Company) could be granted in the
aggregate in the calendar year in which he commenced employment Awards in respect of up to 2,500,000 Ordinary Shares.
 
2.6                               Variation in Share Capital
 
In the event that following the Acquisition Effective Time any change is made in the Shares, without consideration, through merger, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, share dividend, dividend in property other than cash, large nonrecurring cash dividend, share split,
liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or any similar equity restructuring transaction,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, capitalization of profits or reserves, capital distribution, rights issue, the conversion of one class of share to
another or reduction of capital or otherwise, then the Committee shall proportionately and appropriately adjust any or all of the following: (a) the
number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan set forth in Section 2.1; (b) the Exercise Price and/or number and/or class of Shares subject to
each outstanding Option and SAR; (c) the Purchase Price and/or number and/or class of Shares subject to other outstanding Awards; and (d) the
Purchase Price paid under any Restricted Share Award; subject to any required action by the Board or the shareholders of the Company and in
compliance with Applicable Law; provided that (i) in no event shall the Exercise Price or Purchase Price of any share be less than the nominal value
of such share, and (ii) a fraction of a Share will not be issued.  The determination of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
3
 
2.7                               Source of Shares
 
The Shares issued or delivered under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued Shares or acquired Shares, including, subject to Applicable Law,
Shares acquired by the Company or, subject to Section 2.8, the Employee Benefit Trust, on the open market or otherwise.
 
2.8                               Shares Acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust
 
Shares acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust may not be used to satisfy an Award (i) to the extent that such Shares would be offered or delivered
to a person resident in the United States unless the Committee in its sole discretion is satisfied that such offer or delivery would be in compliance
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and/or (ii) to a Director.
 
SECTION 3.0 - GRANT OF AWARDS
 
Except for grants made in substitution for awards in respect of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time and
assumed by the Company and converted to relate to Shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, no Awards may be granted at
any time or times from and after the Acquisition Effective Time. The date of grant of an Award that was assumed by the Company and converted to
an Award in respect of Shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Transaction Agreement shall be the date of grant of the Award by King in respect of
Ordinary Shares.
 
SECTION 4.0 - APPLICABILITY
 
Only those Employees, Consultants, Directors and Non-Employee Directors who held awards in respect of Ordinary Shares that were assumed by
the Company in accordance with the Transaction Agreement shall have any rights in respect of any Award under this Plan from and after the
Acquisition Effective Time.
 
SECTION 5.0 - ADMINISTRATION
 
5.1                               Committee
 
The Committee shall administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, provided that the Board may act in lieu of the Committee on any matter,
subject to Applicable Law.  Subject to the general purposes, terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee will have full power to implement and
carry out the Plan.
 
4
 
Without limiting the generality of any other provision of the Plan, except to the extent that so doing would impair the contractual rights afforded
under any Award Agreement, any rules adopted or other determinations made by the Compensation Committee of King prior to the Acquisition
Effective Time shall no longer apply with respect to Awards from and after the Acquisition Effective Time.
 
5.2                               Authority of Committee
 
The Committee will have the authority to:
 
5.2.1                               construe and interpret the Plan, any Award Agreement and any other agreement or document executed pursuant to the Plan, and in the
event of any dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation of any of the same, or as to any question or right arising from or related to the
Plan, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding upon all persons;
 
5.2.2                               prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award;
 
5.2.3                               determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award, except to the extent that so doing would
impair the contractual rights afforded under any Award Agreement. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the Exercise
Price or Purchase Price, if any, the time or times when the Award may vest and/or be exercised (which may be based on performance
criteria) and/or settled, any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture or transfer or other restrictions, the method to satisfy tax
withholding obligations or any other tax or other liability legally due or agreed to be recovered from the Participant and any restriction or
limitation regarding the Award or the Shares subject thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Committee will determine;
 
5.2.4                               determine the Fair Market Value in good faith and interpret the applicable provisions of the Plan and the definition of Fair Market Value in
connection with circumstances that impact the Fair Market Value, if necessary;
 
5.2.5                               grant waivers of Plan or Award conditions;
 
5.2.6                               accelerate the time or times at which an Award may be exercised or the time or times at which an Award or any part thereof will vest,
notwithstanding the provisions in the Award Agreement setting out the time or times at which it may be exercised or will vest;
 
5
 
5.2.7                               correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in or among the Plan, any Award and/or any Award Agreement;
 
5.2.8                               determine whether to institute any Award Transfer Program and the terms and conditions of such program;
 
5.2.9                               reduce or waive any criteria with respect to Performance Factors;
 
5.2.10                        adjust Performance Factors to take into account changes in law, accounting or tax rules as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate
to reflect the impact of extraordinary or unusual items, events or circumstances to avoid windfalls or hardships, provided that such
adjustments are consistent with the regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to persons whose
compensation is subject to Section 162(m) of the Code;
 
5.2.11                        adopt rules and/or procedures (including the adoption of any subplan under the Plan) relating to the operation and administration of the
Plan to accommodate requirements of local law and procedures;
 
5.2.12                        engage professional advisors and/or experts to advise on any matter that arises under the Plan;
 
5.2.13                        make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; and
 
5.2.14                        delegate any of the foregoing, or any discretion reserved to the Committee under the Plan, with respect to some or all Awards, eligible
individuals and/or Participants, to a subcommittee consisting of one or more executive officers pursuant to a specific delegation, as
permitted by Applicable Law.
 
5.3                               Committee Discretion and Disputes
 
5.3.1                               Any determination made by the Committee with respect to any Award shall be made in its sole discretion at the time of grant of the Award
or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan or Award, at any later time, and such determination shall be final and binding
on the Company and all persons having an interest in the Award.  The Committee’s exercise of any discretionary authority shall not
obligate it to exercise such authority in a like manner thereafter.
 
5.3.2                               Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be submitted by the Participant or Company to the
 
6
 
Committee for review.  The resolution of such a dispute by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company and the Participant. 
The Committee may delegate to one or more executive officers the authority to review and resolve disputes with respect to Awards, and
such resolution shall be final and binding on the Company and the Participant(s) involved, in the same manner and to the same extent as if
the action had been taken by the Committee.
 
5.4                               Delivery of Documentation
 
The Award Agreement for a given Award, the Plan and any other documents relating to the Plan or an Award may be delivered to, and accepted by, a
Participant or any other person in any manner (including electronic distribution or posting, including through any automated system, such as an
interactive website or interactive voice response operated by King, the Company or any third party on their behalf) that meets the requirements of
Applicable Law.
 
5.5                               Award Recipients in Various Countries
 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the Applicable Law of any country in which individuals who are
eligible for Awards or Participants are resident, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to:
 
5.5.1                               determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan;
 
5.5.2                               modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to individuals in any jurisdiction to comply with applicable local laws;
 
5.5.3                               establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent the Committee determines such actions
to be necessary or advisable (and such subplans and/or modifications shall be attached to this Plan as appendices); provided, however, that
no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the Share limitations contained in Section 2; and
 
5.5.4                               take any action, before or after an Award is granted, that the Committee determines to be necessary or advisable to obtain approval or
comply with any local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not take
any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate the Exchange Act or any other applicable United States
securities law.
 
7
 
5.6                               Section 162(m) of the Code
 
When necessary or desirable for an Award to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code the Committee shall
include at least two persons who are “outside directors” (as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code) and at least two (or a majority if more than
two then serve on the Committee) such “outside directors” shall approve the grant of such Award and timely determine (as applicable) the
Performance Period and any Performance Factors upon which vesting or settlement of any portion of such Award is to be subject.  When required by
Section 162(m) of the Code, prior to settlement of any such Award at least two (or a majority if more than two then serve on the Committee) such
“outside directors” then serving on the Committee shall determine and certify in writing the extent to which such Performance Factors have been
timely achieved and the extent to which the Award has been earned or has vested or become exercisable or the Shares subject to such Award have
thereby been earned or vested.  With respect to Participants whose compensation is subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, and provided that such
adjustments are consistent with the regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may adjust the performance goals to
account for changes in law and accounting and to make such adjustments as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the impact of
extraordinary or unusual items, events or circumstances to avoid windfalls or hardships, including without limitation, (a) restructurings, discontinued
operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company
or not within the reasonable control of the Company’s management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted
accounting principles.
 
SECTION 6.0 - OPTIONS
 
6.1                               General
 
An Option is the right to subscribe for up to a specified number of Shares, subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Committee in
accordance with the Plan.  The Committee may grant Options to Employees, Consultants and Directors (including Non-Employee Directors) and
will determine the number of Shares subject to the Option, the Exercise Price, the period or periods during which the Option may be exercised, and
all other terms and conditions of the Option, subject to the following terms of this section.
 
8
 
6.2                               Exercise Price
 
The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by the Committee when the Option is granted provided that the Exercise Price will be not less
than one hundred per cent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of the Option and in no event will be less than the nominal
value of a Share.  Payment of the Exercise Price shall be made in accordance with Section 14, the Award Agreement and any procedures established
by the Company.
 
6.3                               Performance Factors
 
Exercisability of an Option may be, but need not be, conditional upon satisfaction of such Performance Factors during any Performance Period as are
determined by the Committee and set out in the Award Agreement.  If exercisability of the Option is conditional upon the satisfaction of
Performance Factors, then the Committee will: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Option; and
(b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure the performance.  Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may
participate simultaneously with respect to Options that are subject to different performance goals and other criteria.
 
6.4                               Exercise Period
 
Subject to the conditions regarding exercise set forth in the Award Agreement governing an Option, the Option may be exercised for all, or from
time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable; provided, however, that (a) no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of
ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted, and (b) no Option may be exercised at a time when such exercise and/or the issuance of Shares
pursuant to such exercise would be in breach of the Insider Trading Policy or Applicable Law.  The Committee also may provide for Options to
become exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise, in such number of Shares or percentage of Shares as the Committee
determines.
 
6.5                               Method of Exercise
 
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (a) a notice of exercise (in such form as the Committee may specify from time to
time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (b) full payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares with respect to which the Option is
exercised.  Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant.  Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the
appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder will exist with respect to
 
9
 
the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Option is exercised.
 
6.6                               Termination of Service
 
If the Participant’s Service terminates for any reason except for Cause or the Participant’s death, Disability or retirement, then each Option held by
the Participant shall lapse on the date of such termination of Service to the extent such Option is not exercisable by the Participant on such date,
unless the Committee determines otherwise.  The Participant may exercise each Option, to the extent the Option is exercisable by the Participant on
the date his Service terminates, within the period of three (3) months after the date the Participant’s Service terminates, but in any event no later than
the expiration date of the Option, and the Option shall lapse upon the expiration of such period.
 
6.6.1                               Death
 
If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Participant’s death (or the Participant dies within three (3) months after his Service terminates
other than for Cause or because of his Disability or retirement), then each Option held by the Participant shall lapse on the date of such termination
of Service to the extent such Option is not exercisable on such date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.  Each Option, to the extent
exercisable on the date the Participant’s Service terminates, may be exercised by the Participant’s estate or person who acquired the right to exercise
the Option by bequest or inheritance within the period of twelve (12) months after the date the Participant’s Service terminates, but in any event no
later than the expiration date of the Option, and the Option shall lapse upon the expiration of such period.
 
6.6.2                               Disability
 
If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Participant’s Disability, then each Option held by the Participant shall lapse on the date of such
termination of Service to the extent such Option is not exercisable on such date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.  The Participant may
exercise each Option, to the extent the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the date the Participant’s Service terminates, within the period of
twelve (12) months after the date the Participant’s Service terminates, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the Option, and the Option
shall lapse upon the expiration of such period.
 
10
 
6.6.3                               Retirement
 
If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Participant’s retirement in accordance with his contract of Service, then each Option held by the
Participant shall lapse on the date of such termination of Service to the extent such Option is not exercisable on such date, unless the Committee
determines otherwise.  The Participant may exercise each Option, to the extent the Option is exercisable by the Participant on the date the
Participant’s Service terminates, within the period of twelve (12) months after the date the Participant’s Service terminates, but in any event no later
than the expiration date of the Option, and the Option shall lapse upon the expiration of such period.
 
6.6.4                               Cause
 
If the Participant’s Service is terminated for Cause, then, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Participant’s Options shall lapse on such
Participant’s date of termination of Service or, if earlier, upon the service of notice of termination of the Participant’s Service, but in any event no
later than the expiration date of the Option.  Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, Cause shall have the meaning set forth in
Section 25.
 
6.6.5                               Committee Discretion
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.6, the Committee shall have discretion to determine, at the time of grant of an Option or at any
time thereafter, where it considers that it is necessary or appropriate, that an Option shall remain exercisable for a period after the termination of a
Participant’s Service that is less than or greater than the period specified in this Section 6.6, but in no event later than the expiration date of the
Option.
 
6.7                               Limitations on Exercise
 
The Committee may specify a minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option, provided that such minimum
number will not prevent any Participant from exercising an Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable.  An Option may not
be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
6.8                               Modification, Extension or Renewal
 
The Committee may modify or amend the terms of, extend or renew outstanding Options and/or authorize the grant of new Options in substitution
therefor, provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of a
 
11
 
Participant, impair any of such Participant’s rights under any Option previously granted.
 
6.9                               Extension of Option Term where Exercise Is Prohibited
 
If the exercise of an Option, the issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option, or the immediate sale of such Shares during the post-
termination exercise period permitted under Section 6.6 would be in violation of the Insider Trading Policy or Applicable Law, then the period for
exercise of the Option shall be extended such that the Option shall lapse on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a total period (that need not be
consecutive) equal to the applicable post-termination exercise period under Section 6.6 during which such exercise or issuance or sale would not be
in such violation, or (ii) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Award Agreement.
 
6.10                        Potential Termination for Cause
 
The exercise of an Option shall not be permitted during any period in which the Participant is subject to an investigation or disciplinary process
which, in the Committee’s opinion, could result in a termination for Cause.
 
SECTION 7.0 - STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
7.1                               General
 
A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is an award to an eligible Employee, Consultant, or Director (including a Non-Employee Director) in respect of
a specified number of Shares that may be settled, in the discretion of the Committee, in cash or Shares.
 
7.2                               Terms of SARs
 
The Committee will determine the terms of each SAR including, without limitation: (a) the number of Shares subject to the SAR; (b) the Exercise
Price and the time or times during which the SAR may be exercised; (c) the consideration to be distributed on settlement of the SAR and the time or
times when the SAR will be settled; and (d) the effect of the Participant’s termination of Service on the SAR.  The Exercise Price of the SAR will be
determined by the Committee when the SAR is granted, and may not be less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.  Exercise of a SAR
may, but need not be, conditional upon satisfaction of such Performance Factors during any Performance Period as are determined by the Committee
and set out in the individual Award Agreement.  If exercise of the SAR is subject to the satisfaction of Performance Factors, then the Committee
 
12
 
will: (x) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period; and (y) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to
measure the performance.  Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to SARs that are subject
to different Performance Factors and other criteria.
 
7.3                               Exercise Period and Expiration Date
 
A SAR will be exercisable at the time(s) or during the period(s) or upon the occurrence of events determined by the Committee and set forth in the
Award Agreement.  The Award Agreement shall set forth the expiration date; provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten
(10) years from the date the SAR is granted.  The Committee may also provide for SARs to become exercisable at one time or from time to time,
periodically or otherwise (including, without limitation, upon the attainment during a Performance Period of performance goals based on
Performance Factors), in such number of Shares or percentage of the Shares subject to the SAR as the Committee determines.
 
7.4                               Form and Timing of Settlement
 
Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in the amount equal to the product of (a) the excess of
the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price of the SAR and (b) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is
exercised.  At the discretion of the Committee, the payment from the Company for the SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value
(subject to payment by the Participant in cash of the nominal value of any newly issued Shares), or in some combination thereof.  The portion of a
SAR being settled may be paid currently or on a deferred basis with such interest or Dividend Equivalent, if any, as the Committee determines,
provided that the terms of the SAR and any deferral satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, if applicable.
 
7.5                               Termination of Service
 
Vesting of a SAR ceases on the date the Participant’s Service terminates.  Unless otherwise stated in the Award Agreement, the provisions of
Sections 6.6 to 6.10 will also apply to SARs, as they apply to Options.
 
13
 
SECTION 8.0 - RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS
 
8.1                               General
 
A Restricted Share Award is an offer by the Company to issue or procure the transfer to an eligible Employee, Consultant or Director (including a
Non-Employee Director) of Shares that are subject to restrictions, including restrictions on transfer, (“Restricted Shares”).  The Committee will
determine to whom such an offer will be made, the number of Restricted Shares a Participant may acquire, the Purchase Price, the restrictions to
which the Shares will be subject and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted Share Award, subject to the Plan.  “Vesting” for purposes of this
Section 8.0 shall mean the restrictions applicable to Restricted Shares lapsing in accordance with the Award Agreement and “vested” shall be
construed accordingly.
 
8.2                               Restricted Share Award Agreement
 
All purchases under a Restricted Share Award will be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
 
8.3                               Purchase Price
 
The Purchase Price for a Restricted Share Award will be determined by the Committee and may be less than the Fair Market Value of the Restricted
Shares on the date the Restricted Share Award is granted, provided that if the Restricted Shares are newly issued Shares, it shall be no less than the
nominal value of the Restricted Shares.  Payment of the Purchase Price must be made in accordance with Section 14, the Award Agreement and any
procedures established by the Company.
 
8.4                               Terms of Restricted Share Awards
 
Restricted Shares will be subject to such transfer and/or other restrictions as the Committee may impose and/or are required by Applicable Law. 
Lapse of restrictions may be based on completion by the Participant of a specified period or periods of Service and/or upon satisfaction of
Performance Factors during any Performance Period, as set out in the Award Agreement and/or such other conditions as may be determined by the
Committee.  Prior to the grant of a Restricted Share Award, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any
Performance Period for the Restricted Share Award; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any;
(c) determine the number of Restricted Shares that will cease to be subject to the applicable restrictions and thereby vest and the date(s) on which
such vesting will occur; and (d) determine the treatment of Restricted Shares that do not vest
 
14
 
pursuant to the Restricted Share Award, which may include forfeiture or compulsorily transfer by the Participant upon such terms and conditions as
the Committee may determine, and the consideration (if any) payable to the Participant for such Restricted Shares.  Performance Periods may
overlap and a Participant may participate simultaneously with respect to Restricted Share Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods
and having different performance goals and other criteria.
 
8.5                               Termination of Service
 
Except as may be set forth in the Participant’s Award Agreement, vesting ceases on the date the Participant’s Service terminates (unless determined
otherwise by the Committee).
 
8.6                               Issuance or Delivery of Restricted Shares
 
The Company shall issue share certificates that evidence Restricted Shares pending the lapse of the applicable restrictions, and that bear a legend
making appropriate reference to such restrictions.  To enforce any restrictions on a Participant’s Restricted Shares, the Committee may require the
Participant to deposit all certificates representing the Restricted Shares, together with stock powers or other instruments of transfer approved by the
Committee, appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent designated by the Company to hold in escrow until such restrictions have
lapsed or terminated, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends referencing such restrictions to be placed on the certificates.
 
8.7                               Release of Shares upon Vesting
 
As soon as practicable after vesting of a Participant’s Restricted Shares, subject to the Participant’s satisfaction of applicable tax and other
withholding requirements, the Company shall release or procure the release to the Participant, free from the applicable restrictions, of his vested
Shares, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise, and deliver the share certificates.
 
SECTION 9.0 - RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) AWARDS
 
9.1                               General
 
A Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) Award is an award to an eligible Employee, Consultant or Director (including a Non-Employee Director) covering
a specified maximum number of RSUs.
 
15
 
9.2                               Terms of RSU Awards
 
The Committee will determine the terms of an RSU Award including, without limitation: (a) the number of RSUs subject to the RSU Award; (b) the
time or times when the RSUs will vest, and be settled, (c) the Purchase Price, if any, payable under the RSU Award; (d) the consideration to be
distributed on settlement; and (e) the effect of the Participant’s termination of Service on the RSU Award.  Vesting of RSUs may be subject to
completion by the Participant of a specified period of Service or the satisfaction of such performance goals based on Performance Factors during any
Performance Period as are set out in the Participant’s Award Agreement.  If vesting of RSUs is conditional upon satisfaction of Performance Factors,
then the Committee will: (x) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the RSU Award; and (y) select from among
the Performance Factors to be used to measure the performance.  Performance Periods may overlap and Participants may participate simultaneously
with respect to RSU Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods and different performance goals and other criteria.
 
9.3                               Purchase Price
 
The Committee may determine the Purchase Price, if any, applicable to the RSU Award, provided always that if the Shares to be issued in settlement
of RSUs are newly issued Shares, a Purchase Price of no less than the nominal value of the Shares shall be paid by the Participant.  Payment of any
Purchase Price must be made in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan, the Award Agreement and any procedures established by the Company.
 
9.4                               Form and Timing of Settlement
 
Settlement of vested RSUs shall be made as soon as practicable after the vesting date(s) determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award
Agreement.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may settle vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a combination of both.  The Committee may also
permit a Participant to defer settlement under an RSU Award to a date or dates after the RSUs vest provided that the terms of the RSU Award and
any deferral satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, if applicable.
 
9.5                               Termination of Service
 
Except as may be set forth in the Award Agreement, vesting of RSUs shall cease on the date the Participant’s Service terminates (unless determined
otherwise by the Committee) and the RSU Award shall lapse on such date, to the extent the RSUs have not vested.
 
16
 
SECTION 10.0 - UNRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS
 
The Committee may grant Awards covering a specified number of Unrestricted Stock Units.  Each Unrestricted Stock Unit shall entitle the
Participant to receive a Share which shall be free of all restrictions and vested in full upon the date of grant or such other date as the Committee may
determine or which the Committee may issue pursuant to any program under which one or more Employees, Consultants or Directors elect to pay for
such Shares or to receive unrestricted Shares in lieu of cash bonuses that would otherwise be paid.  The Committee shall determine the Purchase
Price, if any, payable for Shares pursuant to an Unrestricted Stock Unit Award, which price may be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares
provided always that where such Shares are newly issued Shares, the Participant shall pay the nominal value of such Shares.  Payment of any
Purchase Price must be made in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan, the Award Agreement and any procedures established by the Company.
 
SECTION 11.0 - PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
11.1                        General
 
A Performance Award is an award to an eligible Employee, Consultant or Director (including a Non-Employee Director) of (a) a cash bonus, or
(b) an award denominated in Shares (“Performance Shares”) that may be settled, in the discretion of the Committee, in cash, or by issuance or
transfer of those Shares (which may consist of Restricted Shares).  Grants of Performance Awards shall be made pursuant to an Award Agreement.
 
11.2                        Terms of Performance Awards
 
The Committee will determine, and each Award Agreement shall set forth, the terms of each Performance Award including, without limitation:
(a) the number of Performance Shares; (b) the Performance Factors and Performance Period that shall determine the time and extent to which each
Performance Award shall be settled; (c) the consideration to be distributed on settlement of an Award of Performance Shares; and (d) the effect of the
Participant’s termination of Service on the Performance Award.  In establishing Performance Factors and the Performance Period the Committee
will: (x) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period; and (y) select from among the Performance Factors to be used. 
Prior to settlement the Committee shall determine the extent to which Performance Awards have been earned.  Performance Periods may overlap and
Participants may participate simultaneously with respect to Performance Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods and different
performance goals and other criteria.
 
17
 
11.3                        Value, Earning and Timing of Performance Shares
 
Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.  After the applicable Performance
Period has ended, the holder of Performance Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Shares earned by the
Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the relevant Performance Factors or other vesting
conditions have been achieved.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which
have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the number of earned Performance Shares at the close of the applicable Performance
Period, and subject to payment by the Participant of the nominal value of any newly issued Shares) or in a combination thereof.
 
11.4                        Termination of Service
 
Except as may be set forth in the Participant’s Award Agreement, vesting ceases on the date Participant’s Service terminates (unless determined
otherwise by the Committee) and the Performance Award lapses to the extent not vested.
 
SECTION 12.0 - AWARDS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
 
12.1                        General

Prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, in no event could the aggregate number of Shares subject to all Awards granted to a Non-Employee Director
in any calendar year exceed 1,250,000 Ordinary Shares.
 
SECTION 13.0 - DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
 
13.1                        Option and SARs

To the extent provided under the terms of any Award Agreement in effect immediately prior to the Acquisition Effective Time, the corresponding
Award
 
18
 
(other than an Option or a SAR) shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents.  Such Dividend Equivalents shall be calculated based on
dividends declared on the Shares to be credited as of dividend payment dates during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date
such Award vests or is settled, as determined by the Committee.  Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash and/or Shares by such
formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee.  Dividend Equivalents granted in respect of an
Award that is subject to vesting conditions that are based on dividends paid prior to the vesting of such Award shall only be paid out to the
Participant if and to the extent the vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the Award vests.
 
SECTION 14.0 - PAYMENT FOR SHARES
 
14.1                        General
 
Payment by a Participant for Shares issued or transferred pursuant to the Plan may be made, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and as
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, by any or any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.  The Committee shall
have authority to grant Awards that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods)
and to grant Awards that require the consent of the Company to utilize a particular method of payment.
 
14.2                        Payment Methods
 
The permitted methods of payment are as follows:
 
14.2.1                        cash, cheque, wire transfer, bank draft or money order payable to the Company;
 
14.2.2                        by consideration received by the Company pursuant to a broker-assisted or other form of cashless exercise program implemented by the
Company in connection with the Plan;
 
14.2.3                        by surrender to the Company of shares of the Company already owned by the Participant or Shares subject to the Award being settled that
have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price or Purchase Price of the Shares as to which the
Award will be exercised or settled;
 
14.2.4                        by deduction from salary or other remuneration payable to the Participant, if permitted by Applicable Law; or
 
19
 
14.2.5                        by any other method of payment as is permitted by Applicable Law and acceptable to the Committee, including through the net settlement
of any Option.
 
SECTION 15.0 - TAXES
 
15.1                        Withholding/Deduction Generally
 
It shall be a condition of the grant, exercise, vesting, cancellation or surrender of an Award, the issuance or delivery of Shares to a Participant
pursuant to an Award, and any other action in relation to an Award that the Participant shall make such arrangements as the Company, King or any
Associated Company or the Employee Benefit Trust or the acquirer in any Corporate Transaction or any other party affiliated to or associated with
the Company may require for the satisfaction of all and any applicable taxes, social security or insurance contributions and other duties and imposts
for which such entity or party is liable to account in any jurisdiction and the Company shall not effect or permit the grant, exercise, vesting,
cancellation or other action in relation to an Award, or the issuance or delivery of Shares to the Participant, until it is satisfied that all such
obligations are or will be satisfied.  Whenever a payment in satisfaction of an Award is to be made in cash, such payment will be net of an amount
determined by the Company, King or the Associated Company employing or engaging the Participant, sufficient to satisfy all applicable tax
requirements and any other liability legally due from the Participant.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may withhold or
account for taxes contemplated by this Section 15.1 by reference to applicable withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable
statutory rates.
 
15.2                        Transfer of Employer Liability to Employee
 
To the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, Applicable Law, the Committee may determine in respect of any Award that liability for
employer taxes, social security or insurance contributions or other imposts shall be transferred to or borne by the Participant.  In the event of such
determination, the terms and conditions for same shall be set out in the Award Agreement.
 
15.3                        Share Withholding
 
The Committee in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time and subject to Applicable Law, may require
or permit a Participant to satisfy any tax or other liability due from the Participant as
 
20
 
described in Section 15.1, or transferred to or borne by the Participant pursuant to a determination made under Section 15.2, in whole or in part by
(without limitation); (a) paying cash, (b) directing the Company to withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal
to the amount required to satisfy the liability, (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to satisfy the liability, or (d) withholding the amount required to satisfy the liability from the proceeds of the sale of otherwise deliverable
Shares acquired pursuant to an Award either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company.  The Fair Market Value
of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date the tax or other liability arises, unless otherwise determined by the
Committee.  For the sake of clarity, if the Company withholds, or the Participant delivers, Shares having a Fair Market Value greater than the amount
required to satisfy the liability, the Participatant will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the
equivalent  Shares.
 
SECTION 16.0 - TRANSFERABILITY
 
16.1                        No Transfer Generally
 
Unless determined otherwise by the Committee or pursuant to Section 16.2, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution, and an Award shall lapse to the extent it is purported to be
sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or otherwise disposed of.  All Awards shall be exercisable: (a) during the Participant’s lifetime
only by (i) the Participant, or (ii) the Participant’s guardian or legal representative; (b) after the Participant’s death, by the Participant’s estate or the
person who acquired the right to the Award by bequest or inheritance, and (c) if the Committee has made the Award transferable pursuant to
Section 16.2, by the transferee.
 
16.2                        Award Transfer Program
 
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Committee shall have the discretion and authority to determine and implement the terms and
conditions of any Award Transfer Program instituted pursuant to this Section 16 including, without limitation, to make Awards transferable by
instrument to a financial institution or other person approved by the Committee, including an inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the Awards
are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor (settlor), or by gift or by domestic relations order to a Permitted Transferee.  The
Committee shall have the authority to amend the terms of any Award participating, or otherwise eligible to participate in, the Award
 
21
 
Transfer Program, including (but not limited to) the authority to (a) amend (including to extend) the expiration date, post-termination exercise period
and/or restrictions on transfer, forfeiture or compulsory transfer conditions of any such Award, (b) amend or remove any provision of the Award
relating to the Participant’s continued Service, (c) amend the permissible payment methods with respect to the exercise or settlement of any such
Award, (d) amend the adjustments to be implemented in the event of changes in the Company’s capitalization and other similar events with respect to
such Award, and (e) include such additional terms and conditions and make such other changes to the terms of such Award or require the transferee
to enter into a new Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion.
 
SECTION 17.0 - SHARE OWNERSHIP
 
17.1                        Privileges of Share Ownership
 
No Participant will have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to any Shares subject to or comprised in an Award until the Shares are issued
or transferred to the Participant, except for any Dividend Equivalents provided in respect of the Award.  After Shares are issued or transferred to the
Participant, the Participant will be a shareholder and have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote and
receive all dividends or other distributions made or paid with respect to such Shares; provided, that if such Shares are Restricted Shares, then any
new, additional or different securities the Participant may become entitled to receive with respect to such Shares by virtue of a share dividend, share
split or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company will be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Shares;
provided, further, that the Participant will have no right to retain such share dividends or share distributions with respect to Restricted Shares that do
not vest and are compulsorily transferred or forfeited by the Participant in accordance with the Award Agreement.
 
17.2                        Certificates
 
All Shares or other securities, whether or not certificated, delivered under the Plan will be subject to such share transfer orders, legends and other
restrictions as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable, including restrictions under any Applicable Law.

and also on the date of exercise, vesting or settlement.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company will have no obligation to
issue or transfer or deliver certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to: (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company
determines are necessary or advisable; and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any law or ruling of any

requirements of any securities laws, exchange control laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company will have no liability
for any inability or failure to do so.

All Awards shall be subject to clawback pursuant to any compensation clawback or recoupment policy adopted by the Board (or a duly appointed
committee thereof) or required by Applicable Law during the term of the Participant’s Service that is applicable to executive officers, employees,
directors and/or other service providers of or to the Company, King or any Associated Company.  In addition to any other remedies available under
Applicable Law, such policy may require, if so determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, the cancellation or forfeiture of outstanding
Awards, in full or in part, (whether or not vested), a reduction in the number of Shares subject to an Award that would vest and/or become
exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreement and/or the recoupment by the Company, King or any Associated Company of any
economic benefit already realized by a Participant with respect to an Award or Shares delivered pursuant to an Award, if the Participant engages or
has engaged
 
23
 
in activity that is inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company, King or any Associated Company, as described in such policy.

20.1.1                        Nothing in the Plan or any Award will confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the Service of, or to
continue any other relationship with, the Company, King or any Associated Company or limit in any way the right of the Company, King

20.1.2                        All Awards shall be granted entirely at the discretion of the Committee.  Unless expressly so provided in his contract of employment or
engagement, no individual employed or engaged by the Company, King or any Associated Company has the right to receive an Award or
shall have any claim against the Company, King or any Associated Company arising out of his not being admitted to participation in the
Plan.  The grant of an Award to a Participant shall not entitle him to receive any subsequent Awards.
 
20.1.3                        Neither the Plan nor an Award shall form part of any contract of employment or engagement between the Company, King or any
Associated Company and any Participant.

in consequence of the termination of his Service, whether for wrongful dismissal or otherwise.

contribution to any pension plan operated by the Company, King or any Associated Company.

(f)                                   if exercise or vesting or settlement of an Award is conditional upon the satisfaction of Performance Factors, waive such
Performance Factors in full or in part or measure the performance as of the date of the Corporate Transaction or a date prior

acquiring entity or its parent company, in cash and/or securities and/or other consideration, equivalent in value per Share, as
determined by the  Committee, to the amount by which value of the consideration payable for a Share in the Corporate
Transaction exceeds the Exercise Price or Purchase Price under the Award and on such terms as the Committee determines,
subject to deduction of applicable taxes and other required deductions;
 
(i)                                     give Participants an opportunity to exercise any Options and/or SARs within a specified period;
 
(j)                                    determine that any Award shall be assumed by the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation or
successor) or surrendered by the Participant and converted into or replaced with an equivalent award, as determined by the
Committee, in respect of such corporation’s shares;
 
(k)                                 in the case of Shares held by a Participant under an Award that are subject to restrictions, determine that such Shares shall be
exchanged for or replaced with substantially similar shares or other property of the surviving corporation (or a parent or
 
26
 
subsidiary of the surviving corporation or successor) subject to restrictions no less favorable to the Participant that will
substantially preserve the applicable terms of the Award; or
 
(l)                                     take any other action in relation to an Award that, in the sole discretion of the Committee, is equitable and substantially delivers
or preserves the value of the Award having regard to the terms of the Award and the terms of the Corporate Transaction.
 
Any such accelerated vesting, exercise, cancellation, surrender, termination, lapse, settlement, assumption, exchange,
replacement or conversion shall take place as of the date the Corporate Transaction becomes effective in accordance with its
terms or such other date as the Committee determines.
 
21.1.2                        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, however, to the extent that any Award or the Shares subject thereto are not accelerated,
cancelled, surrendered, terminated, settled, assumed, exchanged, replaced or converted, as appropriate, pursuant to Section 21.1.1, then
(i) if such Award is an Option or SAR, the Committee shall notify the Participant that it may be exercised, to the extent exercisable, during
a period of time specified by the Committee, and to the extent not so exercised shall lapse upon the Corporate Transaction becoming
effective in accordance with its terms, and (ii) in the case of any other Award, the Award shall lapse upon the Corporate Transaction
becoming effective in accordance with its terms.
 
21.1.3                        The Committee may specify how an Award will be treated in the event of a Corporate Transaction either when the Award is granted or at

21.1.5                        The Committee shall have full and final authority, which shall be exercised in its sole discretion, to determine conclusively whether a
Corporate Transaction has occurred pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the date the Corporate Transaction becomes effective and any
incidental matters relating thereto.
 
21.2                        Involuntary Termination following Corporate Transaction
 
The Committee may provide at the time of grant of an Award or at any time thereafter that in the event the Award continues after the Corporate

27
 
whether pursuant to replacement, assumption, substitution, exchange or conversion pursuant to Section 21.1, and the Service of the Participant
terminates by reason of an Involuntary Termination within eighteen (18) months after the Corporate Transaction, the Award (as so replaced,
assumed, substituted, exchanged or converted), to the extent not exercisable or vested in full, shall become exercisable or vest in full or in part on the

Restricted Shares subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or subject to a forfeiture condition or compulsory transfer may be repurchased or
reacquired by the Company or the Employee Benefit Trust on the terms set out in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, cause some or all Awards to become fully vested and exercisable (to the extent such Awards have not previously expired
or terminated) and/or Restricted Shares to be no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture or compulsory transfer or other restrictions, before the
dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion and on such conditions as the Committee determines.

of the Stock Option, the Company shall make a notation in its books and records to reflect the partial exercise of the Stock Option and the number of Shares

4.             Termination of Employment.

longer be exercisable, whether or not vested, and (iii) be immediately cancelled.

be exercisable.
 
(c)         Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason not
addressed by Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) to the extent vested
as of the date of such termination of employment, be exercisable in accordance with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) (i) in the case of a termination
by the Holder, the 30th day after the date of such termination of employment or (ii) in the case of a termination by the Company Group, the 90th day after the
date of such termination of employment  (or, in either case, if the Holder is prohibited from exercising the Stock Option during some or all of the 30-day or
90-day period, as the case may be, following such termination date because such exercise would not be in compliance with the Exercise Rules and
Regulations, whatever later date may be determined in accordance with a Committee-approved policy) and (B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock
Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the date of such termination of service, the Stock
Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer be exercisable.
 
5.             Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the exercise (in
whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the Award at
the time such Withholding Taxes become due.  The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes
contemplated by this Section 5, which may include any of the following:  (a) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds; (b) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange,
the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of
irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other
brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to
thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such Withholding Taxes;
(c) by tendering previously owned shares (valued at their Market Value per Share as of the date of tender); (d) through the withholding of Shares otherwise
deliverable upon exercise; or (e) by any combination of (a), (b), (c) or (d) above.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any entity in the
Company Group shall have the right to ensure that all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 are satisfied by (i) withholding from the Holder’s
 
A-5
 
compensation, (ii) withholding Shares otherwise then deliverable (in which case the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares
purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option), and (iii) arranging for the sale, on the Holder’s behalf, of Shares otherwise then deliverable.  The Company
shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have
been satisfied.
 
6.             Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.             Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.             Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof)
affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of
the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to
prevent the Award from becoming subject to Section 409A.
 
9.             Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
A-6
 
10.          Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, the Stock Option or Shares with the SEC, any state securities
commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  The Holder shall make such
representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock Option or Shares in compliance with the
provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to register the issuance or resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities
law.
 
11.          Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in
connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these
Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be transferable by the Holder other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.          Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 12 shall apply to the Stock Option if the Holder is or becomes subject to an employment
agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the termination
and cancellation of the Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and (b) payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to
such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount, the Holder, in his or her
discretion, may tender to the Company the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment
Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such termination of the Stock Option and payment of the Recapture
Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with
such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate the Holder’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive
relief and additional monetary damages.
 
13.          Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)           The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to the Holder in connection
with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
A-7
 
(b)           The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
14.          Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
15.          Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.          No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon the
Holder any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
 
17.          No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.          Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
A-8
 
19.          Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)         For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation
shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of California, and no
other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Stock Option is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)         To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
20.          Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and the Holder and, to the extent applicable, the Holder’s permitted assigns under Section 3(b) hereof and the Holder’s
estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
21.          Notices.
 
(a)         Any notice or other document which the Holder may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other
address as the Company by notice to the Holder may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)         Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to the Holder pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Holder at the address shown on any employment agreement or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect
at the time, or such other address as the Holder by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole
discretion, deliver any such document to the Holder electronically via an e-mail to the Holder at his or her Company-provided email address or through a
notice delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party
designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
A-9
 
22.          Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant
Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of
the Plan shall control.
 
23.          Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Holder’s participation in the Plan,
on the Stock Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to facilitate the
administration of the Plan, and to require the Holder to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
24.          Waiver.  The Holder acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by the Holder or any other holder of an equity award from
the Company.

4.             Termination of Employment.

the Company Group for Cause or (b) if the Holder terminates his or her employment with the Company Group in breach of an employment agreement with
any entity in the Company Group, as of the date of such termination of employment the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest, if not then fully vested, (ii) no
longer be exercisable, whether or not vested, and (iii) be immediately cancelled.
 
(b)           Death or Disability. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder dies while employed by any entity in
the Company Group or the Holder’s employment with any entity in the Company Group is terminated due to the Holder’s Disability, the Stock Option shall
(i) cease to vest as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability (as determined by the Committee), as the case may be, and
(ii) to the extent vested as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, remain exercisable in accordance
with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the date of the Holder’s death or termination of employment, as the case may be, and

be exercisable.
 
(c)           Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason not
addressed by Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) to the extent vested
as of the date of such termination of employment, be exercisable in accordance with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) (i) in the case of a termination
by the Holder, the 30th day after the date of such termination of employment or (ii) in the case of a termination by the Company Group, the 90th day after the
date of such termination of employment  (or, in either case, if the Holder is prohibited from exercising the Stock Option during some or all of the 30-day or
90-day period, as the case may be, following such termination date because such exercise would not be in compliance with the Exercise Rules and
Regulations, whatever later date may be determined in accordance with a Committee-approved policy) and (B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock
Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the date of such termination of service, the Stock
Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer be exercisable.
 
A-4
 
5.             Tax Withholding.
 
(a)           Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any Withholding Taxes related to the Holder’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Holder, the Holder acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Withholding Taxes is and remains the
Holder’s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Holder further acknowledges that the Company
and/or the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Withholding Taxes in connection with any aspect of the
Stock Option, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Stock Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock
Option to reduce or eliminate the Holder’s liability for Withholding Taxes or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Holder is subject to tax in more
than one jurisdiction, the Holder acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or
account for Withholding Taxes in more than one jurisdiction.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option
unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have been satisfied.
 
(b)           The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the
exercise (in whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the
Award at the time such Withholding Taxes become due, which may include any of the following:  (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; (ii) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national
securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through
the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent,
such other brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such
exercise and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such
Withholding Taxes; (iii) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise; or (iv) by any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above.  Further,
any entity in the Company Group shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by any of the
aforementioned methods or by withholding from the Holder’s wages or other cash compensation.
 
(c)           The Company Group may withhold or account for Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by reference to applicable
withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates, and if the Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to
satisfy the liability, the Holder will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the
obligation for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of
Shares, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes due as a result of any aspect of the
Holder’s participation in the Plan.  No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option and the issuance of
Withholding Taxes thereunder.
 
A-5
 
6.             Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.             Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.             Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof)
affecting any entity in the Company Group  or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of
the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to
prevent the Award from becoming subject to Section 409A.
 
9.             Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split- off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
10.          Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of the Stock Option or Shares with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such
compliance.  The Holder shall make such representations and furnish such
 
A-6
 
information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock Option or Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any
comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the issuance or
resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
11.          Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order (or a comparable order under applicable local law); provided, however, that any
transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions
of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be
transferable by the Holder other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.          Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)           The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any tax, social insurance, national insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment
on account or other tax liabilities applicable to the Holder in connection with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)           The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
13.          Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
A-7
 
14.          Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
15.          Nature of Grant.  By accepting the Stock Option, the Holder acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
 
(a)           the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and/or these Award Terms;
 
(b)           the grant of the Stock Option is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive
future grants of rights to purchase Common Shares, or benefits in lieu of grants of rights to purchase Common Shares, even if grants of rights to purchase
Common Shares have been granted in the past;
 
(c)           all decisions with respect to future grants of rights to purchase Common Shares, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Company;
 
(d)           the Holder’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;
 
(e)           the Holder’s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment with the Employer or any other entity in the Company
Group and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate the Holder’s employment or service relationship at any time;
 
(f)            the grant of the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income in respect of and the value of the same are
extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and which are outside
the scope of the employment agreement or service contract between the Holder and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if
any;
 
(g)           the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income in respect of and the value of the same are not intended
to replace any pension rights or compensation;
 
(h)           the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income in respect of and the value of the same, are not part of
normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, without limitation, the calculation of any severance, resignation, termination,
redundancy, dismissal, end of service payment, bonus, long-service award, pension or retirement or welfare benefit or similar payments;
 
(i)            the Stock Option grant and the Holder’s participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract
or relationship with the Company and,
 
A-8
 
furthermore, the Stock Option grant will not be interpreted to form an employment agreement or service contract or relationship with any other company in
the Company Group;
 
(j)                                    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
 
(k)                                 if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Stock Option will have no value;
 
(l)                                     if the Holder exercises the Stock Option and obtains Shares, the value of those Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or
decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price;
 
(m)                             unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Stock Option and the Shares subject to the Stock Option, and the income and value
of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service the Holder may provide as a director of any entity of Company Group;
 
(n)                                 no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Stock Option resulting from termination of
the Holder’s continuous service with the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction in which the Holder is employed or the terms of the employment agreement or service contract between the Holder and
the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if any);
 
(o)                                 unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event of the termination of the Holder’s continuous service (regardless of the
reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which the Holder is employed
or the terms of the employment agreement or service contract between the Holder and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group,
if any), the Holder’s right to receive or vest in the Stock Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Holder is no longer
actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of “garden
leave” or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of the termination of the Holder’s continuous service (regardless of the reason for
such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which the Holder is employed or the
terms of the Holder’s employment agreement or service contract, if any), the Holder’s right to exercise the Stock Option after termination of the Holder’s
continuous service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of the Holder’s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period
mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Holder is no longer actively employed for purposes of the
Holder’s Stock Option grant (including whether the Holder may still be considered actively employed while on a leave of absence);
 
(p)                                 the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the
Holder’s participation in the Plan, or the Holder’s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares;
 
A-9
 
(q)                                 the Holder is hereby advised to consult with the Holder’s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Holder’s
participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan;
 
(r)                                    unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Stock Option and the benefits evidenced by these
Award Terms do not create any entitlement to have the Stock Option or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be
exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
 
(s)                                   neither the Company, the Employer nor any other entity in the Company Group shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate
fluctuation between the Holder’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Stock Option or of any amounts due to the
Holder pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon exercise.
 
16.                               Data Privacy.  The Holder hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form,
of the Holder’s personal data as described in the Grant Notice and these Award Terms by and among, as applicable, the Employer or any other entity in
the Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.
 
The Holder understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Holder, including, without
limitation, the Holder’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title, any directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, any Shares owned, details of all options or any other
entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Holder’s favor (the “Data”), for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan.
 
The Holder understands that the Data will be transferred to the Equity Account Administrator, which is assisting the Company with the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  The Holder understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the Holder’s
country, or elsewhere, and that any recipient’s country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Holder’s country.  The Holder
understands that the Holder may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Holder’s local
human resources representative.  The Holder authorizes the Company, the Equity Account Administrator and any other possible recipients which may
assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the
Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder
understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder
understands that the Holder may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any
necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Holder’s local human
resources representative.  Further, the Holder understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If the Holder does
not consent, or if the Holder later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or
 
A-10
 
her employment status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Holder’s consent is that the
Company would not be able to grant the Holder Stock Options or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, the Holder
understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect the Holder’s ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences
of the Holder’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Holder understands that the Holder may contact the Holder’s local human resources
representative.
 
17.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
19.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                                 For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation
shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California, or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of California and no
other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Stock Option is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                                 To the extent that United States federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.
 
20.                               Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and the Holder and, to the extent applicable, the Holder’s permitted assigns under Section 3(b) hereof and the Holder’s
estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
21.                               Delivery of Notices and Other Documents.
 
(a)                                 Any notice or other document which the Holder may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other
address as the Company by notice to the Holder may designate in writing from time to time.
 
(b)                                 Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to the Holder pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these
 
A-11
 
Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed to the Holder at the address
shown on any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, or such
other address as the Holder by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole discretion, deliver any
such document to the Holder electronically via an e-mail to the Holder at his or her Company-provided email address or through a notice delivered to such e-
mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party designated by the Company,
including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
22.                               Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement, service
contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms,
the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment
agreement, service contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award
Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.
 
23.                               Language.  If the Grant Notice, these Award Terms or any other document related to the Plan has been translated into a language other than
English and the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version then, by accepting the Award, the Holder acknowledges that the
English version will control.
 
24.                               Appendix.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option shall be subject to any special terms and conditions
set forth in the Appendix for the Holder’s country, which constitutes a part of these Award Terms.  Moreover, if the Holder relocates to one of the countries
included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the Holder, to the extent the Company determines that the
application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.
 
25.                               Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Holder’s participation in the Plan,
on the Stock Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with
applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require the Holder to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
26.                               Insider Trading/Market Abuse Restrictions.  Depending on the Holder’s country, the Holder may be subject to insider trading restrictions
and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, which may affect the Holder’s ability to, directly or indirectly, acquire, sell, or attempt to sell Shares or
rights to Shares (e.g., Stock Options) under the Plan during such times as the Holder is considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as
defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions or the Holder’s country).  Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition
to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy.  The Holder is responsible for ensuring
 
A-12
 
compliance with any applicable restrictions and should consult his or her personal legal advisor on this matter.
 
27.                               Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Requirements.  The Holder acknowledges that there may be certain foreign asset and/or account reporting
requirements which may affect the Holder’s ability to acquire or hold Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan
(including from any dividends paid on Shares acquired under the Plan) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Holder’s country.  The Holder may be
required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country.  The Holder also may be required to repatriate sale
proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Holder’s participation in the Plan to his or her country through a designated bank or broker within a certain
time after receipt.  The Holder acknowledges that it his or her responsibility to be compliant with such regulations, and the Holder is advised to consult his or
her personal legal advisor for any details.
 
28.                               Waiver.  The Holder acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by the Holder or any other holder of an equity award from
the Company.

This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Holders who reside in and/or work in the countries covered by the Appendix.  These terms
and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Terms.
 
If the Holder is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfers
employment and/or residency after the Stock Option was granted or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes (i.e., the Holder is a
“mobile employee”), the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to the Holder.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which the Holder should be aware with respect to his or her
participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix refers
as of October 2016.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Holder not rely on the
notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at
the time Shares are purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or Shares purchased under the Plan are sold.
 
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of the Holder, and the Company is not in a position to assure
the Holder of any particular result.  Accordingly, each Holder is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her
country may apply to his or her situation.  Finally, if the Holder is a
 
 
mobile employee, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Holder in the same manner.

The following provisions will apply to Holders who are residents of Quebec:
 
Language Consent.  The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Award Terms, including this Appendix, as well as all documents, notices,
and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
 
Consentement relatif à la langue utilisée: Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette annexe, la convention afférente, ainsi que de

Data Privacy Notice and Consent.  This provision supplements Section 16 of the Award Terms:
 
The Holder hereby authorizes the Company and the Company’s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel,
professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Plan.  The Holder further authorizes the Company Group and the Equity Account
Administrator to disclose and discuss the Plan with their respective advisors.

Securities Law Notification.  The Holder is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the Equity Account Administrator, provided that the
resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed.  The Shares
are currently listed on the NASDAQ.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  Foreign property (including Shares) held by Canadian residents must be reported annually on Form T1135
(Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total value of such foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year.  Foreign property includes
Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the Stock Option.  The Stock Option must be reported—generally at a nil cost—if the C$100,000 cost
threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property the Holder holds.  If Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the
Shares.  The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the Shares at exercise, but if the Holder owns other shares of the Company’s common stock,
this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of those other shares.  If due, the form must be filed by April 30 of the following year.  The Holder should
speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

Nature of Grant.  This provision supplements Section 15 of the Award Terms:
 
By participating in the Plan, the Holder acknowledges that he or she understands and agrees that the grant of the Option relates to future services to be
performed and is not a bonus or compensation for past services.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Exchange Control Notification.  The establishment of an account holding Shares or an account holding cash outside Denmark must be reported to the
Danish Tax Administration.  The form which should be used in this respect may be obtained from a local bank.  (Please note that these obligations are
separate from and in addition to the securities/tax reporting obligations described below.)
 
Securities/Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  The Holder may hold Shares acquired under the Plan in a safety-deposit account (e.g., a
brokerage account) with either a Danish bank or with an approved foreign broker or bank, such as the Equity Account Administrator.  If the Shares are held
with a foreign broker or bank, the Holder is required to inform the Danish Tax Administration about the safety-deposit account.  For this purpose, he or she
must file a Form V (Erklaering V) with the Danish Tax Administration.  Both the Holder and the broker or bank must sign the Form V.  By signing the
Form V, the broker or bank undertakes an obligation, without further request each year and not later than on February 1 of the year following the calendar
year to which the information relates, to forward information to the Danish Tax Administration concerning the Shares in the account.  In the event that the
applicable broker or bank with which the account is held does not wish to, or, pursuant to the laws of the country in question, is not allowed to assume such
obligation to report, the Holder acknowledges that he or she is solely responsible for providing certain details regarding the foreign brokerage account and
Shares deposited therein to the Danish Tax Administration as part of his or her annual income tax return.  By signing the Form V, the Holder authorizes the
Danish Tax Administration to examine the account.
 
In addition, if the Holder opens a brokerage account (or a deposit account with a U.S. bank), the brokerage account (or bank account, as applicable) will be
treated as a deposit account because cash can be held in the account.  Therefore, the Holder must also file a Form K (Erklaering K) with the Danish Tax
Administration.  Both the Holder and the broker must sign the Form K.  By signing the Form K, the broker undertakes an obligation, without further request
each year and not later than on February 1 of the year following the calendar year to which the information
 
B-9
 
relates, to forward information to the Danish Tax Administration concerning the content of the deposit account.  In the event that the applicable financial
institution (broker or bank) with which the account is held, does not wish to, or, pursuant to the laws of the country in question, is not allowed to assume such
obligation to report, the Holder acknowledges that he or she is solely responsible for providing certain details regarding the foreign brokerage or bank account
to the Danish Tax Administration as part of the Holder’s annual income tax return.  By signing the Form K, the Holder authorizes the Danish Tax
Administration to examine the account.
 
If the Holder uses the full cashless method of exercise, whereby upon exercise of the Stock Option, the Holder immediately sells all of the Shares being
purchased upon such exercise through a brokerage firm acceptable to the Company and the proceeds of such sale, less an amount in cash equal to the Exercise
Price for the Shares being so purchased, any Withholding Taxes and any brokers’ fees or commissions, are remitted to the Holder, the Holder will not be
required to file a Form V because he or she will not hold any Shares from such exercise thereafter.  However, if the Holder opens a deposit account with a
foreign broker or bank to hold the remaining cash proceeds of such sale, he or she will be required to file a Form K, as described above.  These obligations are
separate from and in addition to the obligations described above.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Cashless Exercise Restriction.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Award Terms to the contrary, due to regulatory requirements in Italy, the Holder will be
required to pay the Exercise Price by a full cashless method of exercise, whereby upon exercise of the Stock Option, the Holder immediately sells all of the
Shares being purchased upon such exercise through a brokerage firm acceptable to the Company and the proceeds of such sale, less an amount in cash equal
to the Exercise Price for the Shares being so purchased, any Withholding Taxes and any brokers’ fees or commissions, are remitted to the Holder.  The
Company reserves the right to provide the Holder with additional methods of exercise depending on local developments.
 
Data Privacy Notice.  This provision replaces Section 16 of the Award Terms:
 
The Holder understands that the Employer, the Company, and any other entity in the Company Group may hold certain personal information about the
Holder, including, without limitation, the Holder’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, passport, social insurance
number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any directorships held in the Company or any other entity in the Company Group, any
Shares owned, details of all options to purchase Shares, or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested, or outstanding
in the Holder’s favor (the “Data”), for the purpose of implementing, managing, and administering the Plan  and in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.
 
The Holder also understands that providing the Company with the Data is mandatory for compliance with local law and necessary for the performance of
the Plan and that his or her denial to provide the Data would make it impossible for the Company to perform its contractual obligations and may affect
the Holder’s ability to participate in the Plan.  The Controller of personal data processing is Activision Blizzard, Inc., with registered offices at 3100
Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 1000, Santa Monica, California 90405, United States of America, and, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, its
representative in Italy is Activision Italia, S.r.l, Corso Sempione 221, 20025 Legnano (MI), Italy.
 
The Holder understands that the Data will not be publicized, but it may be transferred to the Equity Account Administrator, or any other financial
institution or broker involved in the management and administration of the Plan.  The Holder further understands that the Company and/or any entity in
the Company Group will transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Holder’s
participation in the Plan, and that the Company and/or any entity in the Company Group may each further transfer the Data to third parties assisting the
Company in the implementation,
 
B-15
 
administration, and management of the Plan, including any requisite transfer to the Equity Account Administrator or other third party with whom the
Holder may elect to deposit any Shares purchased under the Plan.  Such recipients may receive, possess, use, retain, and transfer the Data in electronic or
other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder understands that these
recipients may be located in or outside the European Economic Area, and may be located in the United States or elsewhere and in locations that might
not provide the same level of protection as intended under Italian data privacy laws.  Should the Company exercise its discretion in suspending all
necessary legal obligations connected with the management and administration of the Plan, it will delete the Data as soon as it has accomplished all the
necessary legal obligations connected with the management and administration of the Plan.
 
The Holder understands that the processing of the Data in connection with the purposes specified above shall take place under automated or non-
automated conditions, anonymously when possible, that comply with the purposes for which the Data is collected and with confidentiality and security
provisions as set forth by applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation Legislative Decree no. 196/2003.
 
The processing activity, including communication of the Data or transfer of the Data abroad (including outside of the European Economic Area), as
herein specified and pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, does not require the Holder’s consent thereto, as the processing is necessary to
performance of contractual obligations related to implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  The Holder understands that, pursuant
to Section 7 of the Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, he or she has the right to access, delete, update, correct, or stop, for legitimate reason, the processing
of the Data.  Furthermore, the Holder is aware that the Data will not be used for direct marketing purposes.  In addition, the Data provided can be
reviewed and questions or complaints can be addressed by contacting the Holder’s local human resources representative.
 
Plan Document Acknowledgment.  In accepting the grant of the Stock Option, the Holder acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan and
the Award Terms (including this Appendix) and has reviewed the Plan and the Award Terms (including this Appendix) in their entirety and fully understand

Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  The Holder is required to report investments held abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and
Stock Options) that may generate income taxable in Italy on an annual tax return (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special
 
B-16
 
form if no tax return is due, irrespective of their value.  The same reporting duties apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments
abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares, Stock Options), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering
provisions.  The Holder should consult his or her personal tax advisor for details regarding this requirement.
 
Foreign Financial Assets Tax Notification.  The fair market value of any Common Shares held outside of Italy is subject to an annual foreign assets tax.

Holder must file a Securities Acquisition Report with the Ministry of Finance through the Bank of Japan within 20 days of the purchase of such Shares.
 
In addition, if the Holder is a Japanese resident and pays more than ¥30,000,000 in a single transaction for the purchase of Shares upon the exercise of the
Stock Option, the Holder must file a Payment Report with the Ministry of Finance through the Bank of Japan by the 20 day of the month following the
month in which the payment was made.  The precise reporting requirements vary depending on whether or not the relevant payment is made through a bank
in Japan.
 
A Payment Report is required independently from a Securities Acquisition Report.  Therefore, if the total amount that the Holder pays upon a one-time
transaction for exercising the Stock Option and purchasing Shares exceeds ¥100,000,000, then the Holder must file both a Payment Report and a Securities
Acquisition Report.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  The Holder will be required to report details of any assets (including any Shares acquired under the Plan)
held outside of Japan as of December 31of each year, to the extent such assets have a total net fair market value exceeding ¥50,000,000.  Such report will be

Holder and whether the Holder will be required to report details of any outstanding Stock Options or Shares held by the Holder in the report.

dividends paid on such Shares in a single transaction to repatriate the proceeds to Korea within 36 months of receipt.
 
If the Holder remits funds out of Korea to pay the Exercise Price, the remittance of funds must be confirmed by a foreign exchange bank in Korea.  This
confirmation is not necessary if the Holder pays the Exercise Price through an arrangement with a broker approved by the Company whereby payment of the
Exercise Price is accomplished with the proceeds of the sale of Shares, because in this case there is no remittance of funds out of Korea.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  Korean residents must declare all foreign financial accounts (e.g., non-Korean bank accounts, brokerage
accounts, etc.) in countries that have not entered into an “intergovernmental agreement for automatic exchange of tax information” with Korea to the Korean
tax authority and file a report with respect to such accounts if the value of such accounts exceeds KRW 1 billion (or an equivalent amount in foreign
currency).  The Holder should consult with his or her personal tax advisor to determine how to value the Holder’s foreign accounts for purposes of this
reporting requirement and whether the Holder is required to file a report with respect to such accounts.

be employees of the Company or any other entity in the Company Group throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon
the express assumption and condition that any grant will not bind the Company or any other entity in the Company Group.  Consequently, the Holder
understands that the Stock Option is granted on the assumption and condition that such Option and any Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option
shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any other entity in the Company Group) and shall not be considered a
mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, the Holder understands that the
Stock Option would not granted but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, the Holder acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or
all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any grant of the Stock Option shall be null and void.
 
Further, the vesting of the Stock Options is expressly conditioned on the Holder’s active employment, such that if the Holder’s employment or service
terminates for any reason whatsoever, the Stock Options cease vesting immediately effective on the date of termination of employment.  This will be the case,
for example, even if the Holder (1) is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) is dismissed for
disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) terminates service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or
contractual condition; (4) terminates service due to the Company’s or any entity in the Company Group’s unilateral breach of contract; or (5) is terminated
from employment for any other reason whatsoever.  Consequently, upon the Holder’s termination of employment for any of the above reasons, the Holder
may automatically lose any rights to Stock Options that were unvested on the date of termination.

more frequent reporting will be required.  The Holder should consult with his or her personal advisor to ensure that the Holder are properly complying with
his or her reporting obligations.

Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset (e.g., Shares, cash, etc.) as of December 31 each year, the Holder is required to report certain
information regarding such rights and assets on tax form 720.  After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will only apply for
subsequent years if the value of any previously-reported rights or assets increases by more than €20,000.  If reporting is required, the reporting must be
completed by the following March 31.

Tax Withholding and Payment.  This section supplements Section 5 of the Award Terms:
 
If payment or withholding of any income tax due is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the
Withholding Taxes occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), the
amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by the Holder to the Employer, effective on the Due Date.  The Holder agrees that the loan
will bear interest at the then-current Official Rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and the
Company or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 5 of the Award Terms.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Holder is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), he
or she shall not be eligible for a loan from the Company to cover the income tax.  In the event that the Holder is a director or executive officer and the income
tax due is not collected from or paid by the Holder by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to the Holder on
which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (“NICs”) may be payable.  The Holder understands that he or she will be responsible for
reporting and paying any income tax and NICs due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the
Company or the Employer (as applicable) for the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit which the Company or the Employer may
recover from the Holder at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 5 of the Award Terms.

compensation.

withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates, and if the Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to
satisfy the liability, Grantee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the obligation
for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Grantee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Vested Shares
underlying the Restricted Share Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes.  No
fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Share Units and the Withholding Taxes thereunder.

equivalent with regard to any cash or other dividends that are declared and paid on Common Shares.
 
8.             Receipt and Delivery.  As soon as administratively practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after any Restricted Share Units vest, the
Company shall (a) effect the issuance or transfer of the resulting Vested Shares, (b) cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to be evidenced on
the books and records of the Company, and (c) cause such Vested Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of the person
entitled to such Vested Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however, that,
in the event such Vested Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 15 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Vested
Shares and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
9.             Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of
 
A-4
 
Grantee taken as a whole without Grantee’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may amend the terms
of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 10 hereof) affecting any entity in
the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other
affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent the Award from
becoming subject to any adverse consequences under Section 409A.
 
10.          Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split- off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
11.          Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or
transfer any Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, and no Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The
Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or
quotation system to effect such compliance.  Grantee shall make such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the
Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Restricted Share Units or
Vested Shares, to issue or transfer Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law
and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the issuance or transfer of Restricted Share Units
or Vested Shares or resale of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state
securities law.
 
12.          Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, and only with the Company’s consent, Grantee may transfer Restricted Share Units for
estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order (or a comparable order under applicable local law); provided, however, that any transferee
shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Company in connection with such transfer; and provided, further that Grantee
 
A-5
 
will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this
Section 12, the Restricted Share Units shall not be transferable by Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
13.          Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)           Grantee is responsible for complying with (i) any tax, social insurance, national insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on
account or other tax liabilities applicable to Grantee in connection with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)           The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by Grantee in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
14.          Section 409A.
 
(a)           Payments contemplated with respect to the Award are intended to comply with Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject
to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (ii) if any provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of Grantee, in the manner
that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties;
provided, however, that this Section 14 does not create an obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no
event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to
Section 409A.
 
(b)           Neither Grantee nor any of Grantee’s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within
the meaning of Section 409A) payable with respect to the Award to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment
or garnishment.  Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to Grantee or for
Grantee’s benefit with respect to the Award may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by Grantee to the Company.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) the Committee determines in good faith that the Restricted Share
Units do not qualify for the “short-term deferral exception” under Section 409A, (ii) Grantee is a “specified employee” (as defined
 
A-6
 
in Section 409A) and (iii) a delay in the issuance or transfer of Vested Shares to Grantee or his or her estate or beneficiaries hereunder by reason of Grantee’s
“separation from service” (as defined in Section 409A) with any entity in the Company Group is required to avoid tax penalties under Section 409A but is not
already provided for by this Award, the Company shall cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to Grantee or Grantee’s estate or beneficiary upon
the earlier of (A) the date that is the first business day following the date that is six months after the date of Grantee’s separation from service and
(B) Grantee’s death.
 
15.          Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Vested
Shares to bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’), OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.          Nature of Grant.  By accepting the Award, Grantee acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
 
(a)           the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and/or these Award Terms;
 
(b)           the grant of the Restricted Share Units is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right
to receive future grants of rights to receive Common Shares, or benefits in lieu of rights to receive Common Shares, even if rights to receive Common Shares
have been granted in the past;
 
(c)           all decisions with respect to future grants of rights to receive Common Shares, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Company;
 
(d)           Grantee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;
 
(e)           Grantee’s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment with the Employer or any other entity in the Company
Group and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate Grantee’s employment or service relationship at any time;
 
(f)            the grant of the Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares underlying the Restricted Share Units, and the income in respect
of and the value of the same, are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the
Employer, and are outside the scope of the employment
 
A-7
 
agreement or service contract between Grantee and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if any;
 
(g)           the Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares underlying the Restricted Share Units, and the income in respect of and the
value of the same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
 
(h)           the Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares underlying the Restricted Share Units, and the income in respect of and the
value of the same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, without limitation, the calculation of any severance,
resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payment, bonus, long-service award, pension or retirement or welfare benefit or similar
payments;
 
(i)            the Restricted Share Unit grant and Grantee’s participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service
contract or relationship with the Company and, furthermore, the Restricted Share Unit grant will not be interpreted to form an employment agreement or
service contract or relationship with any other company in the Company Group;
 
(j)            the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
 
(k)           unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Restricted Share Units and the Common Shares subject to the Restricted Share
Units, and the income and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service the Grantee may provide as a director of any
entity of Company Group;
 
(l)            no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Share Units resulting from
termination of Grantee’s continuous service with the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not later found to be invalid or in
breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which Grantee is employed or the terms of the employment agreement or service contract between Grantee
and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if any);
 
(m)          unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event of the termination of Grantee’s continuous service (for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which Grantee is employed or the terms of the
employment agreement or service contract between Grantee and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if any), Grantee’s
right to receive or vest in the Restricted Share Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Grantee is no longer actively employed
and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of “garden leave” or similar
period pursuant to local law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Grantee is no longer actively employed for purposes of
Grantee’s Restricted
 
A-8
 
Share Unit grant (including whether Grantee may still be considered actively employed while on a leave of absence);
 
(n)           the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding
Grantee’s participation in the Plan, or Grantee’s acquisition or sale of the underlying Common Shares;
 
(o)           Grantee is hereby advised to consult with Grantee’s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Grantee’s
participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan;
 
(p)           unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Share Units and the benefits evidenced
by these Award Terms do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Share Units or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company,
nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Common Shares; and
 
(q)           neither the Company, the Employer nor any other entity in the Company Group shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate
fluctuation between Grantee’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Restricted Share Units or of any amounts due to
Grantee pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Share Units or the subsequent sale of any Common Shares acquired upon settlement.
 
17.          Data Privacy.  Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
Grantee’s personal data as described in the Grant Notice and these Award Terms by and among, as applicable, the Employer or any other entity in the
Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Grantee’s participation in the Plan.
 
Grantee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about Grantee, including, without limitation,
Grantee’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, any Shares owned, details of all Restricted Share Units or any other
entitlement to the Common Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Grantee’s favor (the “Data”), for the purpose of
implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
 
Grantee understands that the Data will be transferred to the Equity Account Administrator, which is assisting the Company with the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  Grantee understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in Grantee’s country,
or elsewhere, and that any recipient’s country may have different data privacy laws and protections than Grantee’s country.  Grantee understands that
Grantee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Grantee’s local human resources
representative.  Grantee authorizes the Company, the Equity Account Administrator and any other possible recipients which may assist the
 
A-9
 
Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in
electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing Grantee’s participation in the Plan.  Grantee understands that
the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Grantee’s participation in the Plan.  Grantee understands that
Grantee may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to
the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Grantee’s local human resources representative. 
Further, Grantee understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If Grantee does not consent, or if Grantee later
seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or
withdrawing Grantee’s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Restricted Share Units or other equity awards to Grantee or administer or
maintain such awards.  Therefore, Grantee understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect Grantee’s ability to participate in the Plan.  For
more information on the consequences of Grantee’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Grantee understands that Grantee may contact
Grantee’s local human resources representative.
 
18.          No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of Restricted Share Units shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any
right of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable
against the Company except to the extent set forth in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
19.          Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
20.          Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)           For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Restricted Share Units or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of
California and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Restricted Share Units is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)           To the extent that United States federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement
of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.
 
21.          Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award
 
A-10
 
Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantee’s
permitted assigns under Section 12 hereof and Grantee’s estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
22.          Delivery of Notices and Other Documents.
 
(a)           Any notice or other document which Grantee may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other address as the
Company by notice to Grantee may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)           Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to Grantee pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to Grantee at the address shown on any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in
effect at the time, or such other address as Grantee by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole
discretion, deliver any such document to Grantee electronically via an e-mail to Grantee at his or her Company-provided email address or through a notice
delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party
designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
23.          Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement, service
contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms,
the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment
agreement, service contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms
and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.
 
24.          Language.  If the Grant Notice, these Award Terms or any other document related to the Plan has been translated into a language other than
English and the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version then, by accepting the Award, Grantee acknowledges that the English
version will control.
 
25.          Appendix.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Restricted Share Units shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions set forth in the Appendix for Grantee’s country, which constitutes a part of these Award Terms.  Moreover, if Grantee relocates to one of the
countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and
 
A-11
 
conditions for such country will apply to Grantee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or
advisable in order to comply with applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.
 
26.          Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Grantee’s participation in the Plan, on
the Restricted Share Units and on any Common Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
comply with applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Grantee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that
may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
27.          Insider Trading/Market Abuse Restrictions.  Depending on Grantee’s country, Grantee may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or
market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, which may affect Grantee’s ability to, directly or indirectly, acquire, sell, or attempt to sell Common Shares or
rights to Common Shares (e.g., Restricted Share Units) under the Plan during such times as Grantee is considered to have “inside information” regarding the
Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions or Grantee’s country). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and
in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. Grantee is responsible for ensuring compliance with
any applicable restrictions and should consult Grantee’s personal legal advisor on this matter.
 
28.          Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Requirements.  Grantee acknowledges that there may be certain foreign asset and/or account reporting
requirements which may affect Grantee’s ability to acquire or hold Common Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan
(including from any dividends paid on Common Shares acquired under the Plan) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Grantee’s country.  Grantee may
be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country.  Grantee also may be required to repatriate sale
proceeds or other funds received as a result of Grantee participation in the Plan to his or her country through a designated bank or broker within a certain time
after receipt.  Grantee acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to be compliant with such regulations, and Grantee is advised to consult his or her
personal legal advisor for any details.
 
29.          Waiver.  Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by Grantee or any other grantee of an equity award from the
Company.

This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Grantees who reside and/or work in the countries covered by the Appendix.  These terms
and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Terms.
 
If Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfers employment
and/or residency after the Restricted Share Units were granted or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes (i.e., Grantee is a “mobile
employee”), the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to Grantee.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which Grantee should be aware with respect to his or her
participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix refers
as of October 2016.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that Grantee not rely on the
notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at
the time Grantee vests in the Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares acquired under the Plan are sold.
 
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of Grantee, and the Company is not in a position to assure
Grantee of any particular result.  Accordingly, Grantee is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may
apply to his or her situation.  Finally, if Grantee is a mobile
 
 
employee, the information contained herein may not be applicable to Grantee in the same manner.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.
2014 INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AWARD TERMS
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Restricted Share Units Payable Only in Common Shares.  The grant of Restricted Share Units does not provide any right for Grantee to receive a cash
payment, and the Restricted Share Units are payable in Common Shares only.
 
Termination of Employment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3(b) of the Award Terms, unless the Committee determines otherwise, in
the event of the termination of Grantee’s continuous service (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in
breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which Grantee is employed or the terms of Grantee’s employment agreement or service contract, if any),
Grantee’s right to receive or vest in the Restricted Share Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of the date is the earliest of: (1) the date Grantee’s
employment or service with the Company Group is terminated, (2) the date Grantee receives notice of termination of employment or service from the
Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, and (3) the date Grantee is no longer actively employed or rendering services to the Company Group,
regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law (including, but not limited to, statutory law, regulatory law
and/or common law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Grantee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the
Restricted Share Units (including whether Grantee may still be considered actively employed while on a leave of absence).
 
The following provisions will apply to Grantees who are residents of Quebec:
 
Language Acknowledgment.  The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Award Terms, including this Appendix, as well as all documents,
notices, and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
 
Consentement relatif à la langue utilisée: Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette annexe, la convention afférente, ainsi que de
tous documents, avis donnés et procédures judiciaires exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement aux présentes.

administration and operation of the Plan.  Grantee further authorizes the Company Group and the Equity Account Administrator to disclose and discuss the
Plan with their respective advisors.  Grantee further authorizes the Company Group to record such information and to keep such information Grantee’s
employee file.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Securities Law Notification.  Grantee is permitted to sell Common Shares acquired under the Plan through the Equity Account Administrator, provided that
the resale of Common Shares acquired under the Plan takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Common Shares
are listed.  The Common Shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  Foreign property held by Canadian residents must be reported annually on Form T1135 (Foreign Income
Verification Statement) if the total value of such foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year.  Foreign property includes Common Shares
acquired under the Plan and may include the Restricted Share Units.  The Restricted Share Units must be reported—generally at a nil cost—if the C$100,000
cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property Grantee holds.  If Common Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base
(“ACB”) of the Common Shares.  The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the Common Shares at vesting, but if Grantee owns other shares of
the Company’s common stock, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of those other shares.  If due, the form must be filed by April 30 of the
following year. Any filing which is due must be made by April 30th of the following year. Grantee should speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the
scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.
2014 INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AWARD TERMS
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Nature of Grant.  This provision supplements Section 16 of the Award Terms:
 
By participating in the Plan, Grantee acknowledges that he or she understands and agrees that the grant of the Restricted Share Units relates to future services
to be performed and is not a bonus or compensation for past services.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Exchange Control Notification.  The establishment of an account holding Common Shares or an account holding cash outside Denmark must be reported to
the Danish Tax Administration.  The form which should be used in this respect may be obtained from a local bank.  (Please note that these obligations are
separate from and in addition to the securities/tax reporting obligations described below.)
 
Securities/Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.   Grantee may hold Common Shares acquired under the Plan in a safety-deposit account (e.g., a
brokerage account) with either a Danish bank or with an approved foreign broker or bank, such as the Equity Account Administrator.  If the Common Shares
are held with a foreign broker or bank, Grantee is required to inform the Danish Tax Administration about the safety-deposit account.  For this purpose, he or
she must file a Form V (Erklaering V) with the Danish Tax Administration.  Both Grantee and the broker or bank must sign the Form V.  By signing the
Form V, the broker or bank undertakes an obligation, without further request each year and not later than on February 1 of the year following the calendar
year to which the information relates, to forward information to the Danish Tax Administration concerning the Common Shares in the account.  In the event
that the applicable broker or bank with which the account is held does not wish to, or, pursuant to the laws of the country in question, is not allowed to assume
such obligation to report, Grantee acknowledges that he or she is solely responsible for providing certain details regarding the foreign brokerage account and
Common Shares deposited therein to the Danish Tax Administration as part of his or her annual income tax return.  By signing the Form V, Grantee
authorizes the Danish Tax Administration to examine the account.
 
In addition, if Grantee opens a brokerage account (or a deposit account with a U.S. bank), the brokerage account (or bank account, as applicable) will be
treated as a deposit account because cash can be held in the account.  Therefore, Grantee must also file a Form K (Erklaering K) with the Danish Tax
Administration.  Both Grantee and the broker must sign the Form K.  By signing the Form K, the broker undertakes an obligation, without further request

Grantee understands that the Employer, the Company, and any other entity in the Company Group may hold certain personal information about Grantee,
including, without limitation, Grantee’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, passport, social insurance number or
other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any directorships held in the Company or any other entity in the Company Group, any Shares
owned, details of all Restricted Share Units or any other entitlement to Common Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested, or outstanding in
Grantee’s favor (“Data”), for the purpose of implementing, managing, and administering the Plan and in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.
 
Grantee also understands that providing the Company with the Data is mandatory for compliance with local law and necessary for the performance of the
Plan and that his or her denial to provide the Data would make it impossible for the Company to perform its contractual obligations and may affect
Grantee’s ability to participate in the Plan.  The Controller of personal data processing is Activision Blizzard, Inc., with registered offices at 3100 Ocean
Park Blvd., Suite 1000, Santa Monica, California 90405, United States of America, and, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, its representative in

Grantee understands that the Data will not be publicized, but it may be transferred to the Equity Account Administrator or any other financial institution
or broker involved in the management and administration of the Plan.  Grantee further understands that the Company and/or any entity in the Company
Group will transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementing, administering, and managing Grantee’s participation in
the Plan, and that the Company and/or any entity in the Company Group may each further transfer the Data to third parties assisting the Company in the

necessary legal obligations connected with the management and administration

The processing activity, including communication of the Data or transfer of the Data abroad (including outside of the European Economic Area), as
herein specified and pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, does not require Grantee’s consent thereto, as the processing is necessary to
performance of contractual obligations related to implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  Grantee understands that, pursuant to
Section 7 of the Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, he or she has the right to access, delete, update, correct, or stop, for legitimate reason, the processing of

(1)                                 Grantee’s participation in the Plan does not constitute an acquired right;
 
(2)                                 The Plan and Grantee’s participation in it are offered by the Company on a wholly discretionary basis;
 
(3)                                 Grantee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; and

Labor Law Acknowledgement and Policy Statement.  By accepting the Restricted Share Units, Grantee acknowledges that the Company with registered

acknowledges that his or her participation in the Plan, the grant of Restricted Share Units and any acquisition of Common Shares under the Plan do not

rights between Grantee and his or her Employer, Activision-Mexico, and do not form part of the employment conditions and/or benefits provided by
Activision-Mexico, and any modification of the Plan or its termination shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of Grantee’s
employment.
 
Grantee further understands that his or her participation in the Plan is the result of a unilateral and discretionary decision of the Company and, therefore, the
Company reserves the absolute right to amend and/or discontinue Grantee’s participation in the Plan at any time, without any liability to Grantee.

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Nature of Grant. This provision supplements Section 16 of the Award Terms:
 
In accepting the Restricted Share Units, Grantee consents to participate in the Plan and acknowledges having received and read a copy of the Plan.
 
Grantee understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant Restricted Share Units under the Plan to individuals
who may be employees of the Company or any other entity in the Company Group throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered
into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not bind the Company or any other entity in the Company Group.  Consequently, Grantee
understands that the Restricted Share Units are granted on the assumption and condition that such Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares acquired
under the Plan shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any other entity in the Company Group) and shall not be
considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, Grantee understands
that the Restricted Share Units would not granted but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, Grantee acknowledges and freely accepts
that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any grant of the Restricted Share Units
shall be null and void.
 
Further, the vesting of the Restricted Share Units is expressly conditioned on Grantee’s active employment, such that if Grantee’s employment or service
terminates for any reason whatsoever, the Restricted Share Units cease vesting immediately effective on the date of termination of employment.  This will be
the case, for example, even if Grantee (1) is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) is
dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) terminates service due to a change of work location, duties or any other
employment or contractual condition; (4) terminates service due to the Company’s or any entity in the Company Group’s unilateral breach of contract; or
(5) is terminated from employment for any other reason whatsoever.  Consequently, upon Grantee’s termination of employment for any of the above reasons,
Grantee may automatically lose any rights to Restricted Share Units that were unvested on the date of termination.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Exchange Control Notification.  The acquisition, ownership and sale of Common Shares under the Plan must be declared for statistical purposes to the
Spanish Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department
 
B-29
 
of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.  Generally, the declaration must be made each January for Common Shares owned as of December 31 of
the prior year, by means of a D-6 form; however, if the value of the Common Shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or if Grantee holds 10% or more of
the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle Grantee to join the Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed also
within one month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
 
Grantee is required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), foreign instruments
(including any Common Shares acquired under the Plan) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Common Shares made
to Grantee by the Company), depending on the amount of the transactions during the relevant year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
relevant year. Generally, the report is required on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in Grantee’s foreign accounts,
together with value of his or her foreign instruments and the aggregate volume of his or her transactions with non-Spanish residents, exceed €100,000,000,
more frequent reporting will be required.  Grantee should consult with his or her personal advisor to ensure that Grantee is properly complying with his or her
reporting obligations.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  If Grantee holds rights or assets (e.g., Common Shares or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside
of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset (e.g., Common Shares, cash, etc.) as of December 31 each year, Grantee is required to
report certain information regarding such rights and assets on tax form 720.  After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will
only apply for subsequent years if the value of any previously-reported rights or assets increases by more than €20,000.  If reporting is required, the reporting
must be completed by the following March 31.  Grantee should consult his or her personal tax advisor for details regarding this requirement.
 
Securities Law Notification.  The Restricted Share Units described in this document do not qualify as securities under Spanish regulations.  No “offer of
securities to the public,” within the meaning of Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory.  The Plan, the Award Terms (including
this Appendix), and any other documents evidencing the award of Restricted Share Units have not been, nor will they be, registered with the Comisión

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Tax Withholding and Payment.  This section supplements Section 4 of the Award Terms:
 
If payment or withholding of any income tax due is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the
Withholding Taxes occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), the
amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by Grantee to the Employer, effective on the Due Date.  Grantee agrees that the loan will
bear interest at the then-current Official Rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and the Company
or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 4 of the Award Terms.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Grantee is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), he or
she shall not be eligible for a loan from the Company to cover the income tax.  In the event that Grantee is a director or executive officer and the income tax
due is not collected from or paid by Grantee by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to Grantee on which
additional income tax and national insurance contributions (“NICs”) may be payable.  Grantee understands that he or she will be responsible for reporting and
paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Employer
(as applicable) for the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit which the Company or the Employer may recover from Grantee at any time
thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 4 of the Award Terms.

with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the date of the Holder’s death or termination of employment, as the case may be, and

date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, the Stock Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer
be exercisable.
 
(c)                            Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason not
addressed by Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) to the extent vested
as of the date of such termination of employment, be exercisable in accordance with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) (i) in the case of a termination
by the Holder, the 30th day after the date of such termination of employment or (ii) in the case of a termination by the Company Group, the 90th day after the
date of such termination of employment  (or, in either case, if the Holder is prohibited from exercising the Stock Option during some or all of the 30-day or
90-day period, as the case may be, following such termination date because such exercise would not be in compliance with the Exercise Rules and
Regulations, whatever later date may be determined in accordance with a Committee-approved policy) and (B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock
Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the date of such termination of service, the Stock
Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer be exercisable.
 
5.                                      Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the exercise (in
whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the Award at
the time such Withholding Taxes become due.  The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes
contemplated by this Section 5, which may include any of the following:  (a) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds; (b) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange,
the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of
irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other
brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to

deliverable upon exercise; or (e) by any combination of (a), (b), (c) or (d) above.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any entity in the
Company Group shall have the right to ensure that all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 are satisfied by (i) withholding from the Holder’s

compensation, (ii) withholding Shares otherwise then deliverable (in which case the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares
purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option), and (iii) arranging for the sale, on the Holder’s behalf, of Shares otherwise then deliverable.  The Company
shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have
been satisfied.
 
6.                                      Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof)
affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of
the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to
prevent the Award from becoming subject to Section 409A.
 
9.                                      Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
A-6
 
10.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, the Stock Option or Shares with the SEC, any state securities
commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  The Holder shall make such
representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock Option or Shares in compliance with the
provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to register the issuance or resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities
law.
 
11.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in
connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these
Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be transferable by the Holder other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.                               Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 12 shall apply to the Stock Option if the Holder is or becomes subject to an employment
agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the termination
and cancellation of the Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and (b) payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to
such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount, the Holder, in his or her
discretion, may tender to the Company the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment
Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such termination of the Stock Option and payment of the Recapture
Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with
such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate the Holder’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive
relief and additional monetary damages.
 
13.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to the Holder in connection
with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
A-7
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
14.                               Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
15.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.                               No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon the
Holder any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
 
17.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
A-8
 
19.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                           For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation
shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of California, and no
other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Stock Option is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                           To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
20.                               Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and the Holder and, to the extent applicable, the Holder’s permitted assigns under Section 3(b) hereof and the Holder’s
estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
21.                               Notices.
 
(a)                           Any notice or other document which the Holder may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other
address as the Company by notice to the Holder may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)                           Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to the Holder pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Holder at the address shown on any employment agreement or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect
at the time, or such other address as the Holder by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole
discretion, deliver any such document to the Holder electronically via an e-mail to the Holder at his or her Company-provided email address or through a
notice delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party
designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
A-9
 
22.                               Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant
Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of
the Plan shall control.
 
23.                               Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Holder’s participation in the Plan,
on the Stock Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to facilitate the
administration of the Plan, and to require the Holder to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
24.                               Waiver.  The Holder acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by the Holder or any other holder of an equity award from
the Company.

Company shall (a) effect the issuance or transfer of the resulting Vested Shares, (b) cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to be evidenced on
the books and records of the Company, and (c) cause such Vested Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of the person
entitled to such Vested Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however, that,
in the event such Vested Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 16 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Vested
Shares and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
9.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company
 
A-4
 
under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination
to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole
and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award
prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of Grantee taken as a whole without Grantee’s
consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual
or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 10 hereof) affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the
Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes
in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent the Award from becoming subject to any adverse
consequences under Section 409A.
 
10.                               Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
11.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or transfer
any Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, and no Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares with the SEC, any state
securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  Grantee shall make
such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, to issue or transfer Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares
in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to register the issuance or transfer of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares or resale of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares under
the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
A-5
 
12.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, Grantee may transfer Restricted Share Units for
estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such
transfer; and provided, further that Grantee will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as
otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 12, the Restricted Share Units shall not be transferable by Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.
 
13.                               Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 13 shall apply to the Restricted Share Units if Grantee is or becomes subject to an
employment agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the
forfeiture by Grantee to the Company of any outstanding Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares which have yet to settle pursuant to Section 8 hereof and
(b) payment by Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by
Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount, Grantee, in his or her discretion, may tender to the Company the Vested Shares acquired during the Look-
back Period with respect to such Employment Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such forfeiture of
Restricted Share Units and payment of the Recapture Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy
available to the Company arising out of or in connection with such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate Grantee’s
employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive relief and additional monetary damages.
 
14.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 Grantee is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to Grantee in connection with the
Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by Grantee in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
A-6
 
15.                               Section 409A.
 
(a)                                 Payments contemplated with respect to the Award are intended to comply with Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject
to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (ii) if any provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of Grantee, in the manner
that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties;
provided, however, that this Section 15 does not create an obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no
event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to
Section 409A.
 
(b)                                 Neither Grantee nor any of Grantee’s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within
the meaning of Section 409A) payable with respect to the Award to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment
or garnishment.  Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to Grantee or for
Grantee’s benefit with respect to the Award may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by Grantee to the Company.
 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) the Committee determines in good faith that the Restricted Share
Units do not qualify for the “short-term deferral exception” under Section 409A, (ii) Grantee is a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A) and
(iii) a delay in the issuance or transfer of Vested Shares to Grantee or his or her estate or beneficiaries hereunder by reason of Grantee’s “separation from
service” (as defined in Section 409A) with any entity in the Company Group is required to avoid tax penalties under Section 409A but is not already provided
for by this Award, the Company shall cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to Grantee or Grantee’s estate or beneficiary upon the earlier of
(A) the date that is the first business day following the date that is six months after the date of Grantee’s separation from service or (B) Grantee’s death.
 
A-7
 
16.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Vested
Shares to bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’), OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
17.                               No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon
Grantee any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge Grantee at any time, with or without Cause.
 
18.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of Restricted Share Units shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any
right of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable
against the Company except to the extent set forth in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
19.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
20.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                                 For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Restricted Share Units or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of
California, and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Restricted Share Units is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                                 To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
A-8
 
21.          Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantee’s permitted assigns under Section 12 hereof and Grantee’s estate or
beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
22.          Notices.
 
(a)           Any notice or other document which Grantee may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other address as the
Company by notice to Grantee may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)           Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to Grantee pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to Grantee at the address shown on any employment agreement or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, or
such other address as Grantee by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole discretion, deliver
any such document to Grantee electronically via an e-mail to Grantee at his or her Company-provided email address or through a notice delivered to such e-
mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party designated by the Company,
including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
23.          Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant
Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the
Plan shall control.
 
24.          Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Grantee’s participation in the Plan, on
the Restricted Share Units and on any Common Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Grantee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.
 
25.          Waiver.  Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other
 
A-9
 
provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by Grantee or any other grantee of an equity award from the Company.

Guidelines 
·                                        Each Non-Affiliated Director is required, within four years following his or her first election to the Board, to
beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) shares of the Company’s common stock (including any restricted shares of common stock or restricted
share units payable in shares of the Company’s common stock) having an aggregate value at least equal to five
times the amount of the annual cash Board retainer that we then pay such director for regular service on the Board.
·                                          For purposes of determining compliance with the share ownership guidelines, the aggregate value of the shares
owned by the director is calculated as of January 2nd of each applicable year (or if such date is not a trading date,
the next trading date) based on the higher of:
 
·                                          the NASDAQ Official Closing Price of the Company’s common stock on that day; and
 
·                                          the NASDAQ Official Closing Price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant (or if such
date is not a trading date, the next trading date), for any shares awarded to the director by the
Company, and the actual cost to the director, for any other shares (e.g., with respect to shares acquired
through the exercise of stock options, the exercise price).
 
·                                          Non-Affiliated Directors are subject to these guidelines for as long as they continue to serve on the Board.
