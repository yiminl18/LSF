PART IITEM 1. BUSINESS
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a publicutility operating in North
ern and Central California. The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905. PG&E Corporation became the holding company of theUtility and its subsidiari
es in 1997. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility’sservice area is shown in the g
raphic below.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s op
erating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, California 94177. PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415) 973-7000.This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo
r PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is a separate entity, withdistinct creditors and 
claimants, and is subject to separate laws, rules, and regulations.Over the past several yea
rs, Northern California has experienced major wildfires. For more information about material wildfires, see Item 7. MD&A, and Note 14of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.This 2021 Form 10-K contains forward-looking s
tatements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risksthat could affect th
e outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows, see I
tem 1A. Risk Factors and “Forward-Looking Statements” above.Triple Bottom Line
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s pu
rpose is to deliver for their hometowns, serve the planet, and lead with love. In support of this purpose, the companiesemploy a Lean operating mod
el designed to drive more effective and responsive decision-making, reduce the human struggle many coworkers face in their day-to-day work, and deliver better ou
tcomes for customers and communities.PG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the “triple bottom line” of people, planet, andprosperity, which is underpinned by pe
rformance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value they create for customers and investors, butalso their responsibili
ty to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line is designed to balance the interests of the companies’ many stakeholders, and itreflects the broader societal impact
s of the companies’ activities.14

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and prosperity in their daily operations as well asin their long-term st
rategic decisions. The Utility will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment in order to support its customer-driven investment planwhile pursuing cost-control m
easures that would allow it to maintain the affordability of its service. The Lean operating system is an important means of realizingPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ob
jective of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.People
The people element of th
e triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to their workforce, their customers, the residents oflocal communities in whi
ch the companies do business, and other stakeholders.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s go
al is to continually reduce risk to keep customers, the communities they serve, and their workforce (both employees andcontractors) safe. The
ir focus is on continuously building an organization where every work activity is designed to facilitate safe performance, every worker knowsand practices safe beh
aviors, and every individual is encouraged to speak up and stop work if they see unsafe or risky behavior, and has confidence that theirconcerns and ideas will be he
ard and pursued. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to significantly improving their safety performance byunderstanding their risks, pr
ioritizing their work, using controls to reduce risks, and continuously measuring and improving risk reduction.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s hu
man capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitable workforce. PG&ECorporation and the Utility pl
ace a high priority on delivering customer value and providing a hometown customer experience. The Utility’s customer-driveninvestment program is aimed
 at improving safety, increasing electric and gas reliability, and improving customer satisfaction.For more information, see 
“Human Capital” below.Planet
The planet element of 
the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to protect and serve the environment. This commitmentextends beyond compliance with v
arious state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Management believes that integrating andmanaging climate ch
ange and other environmental considerations in the companies’ business strategies creates long-term value for PG&E Corporation and theUtility, and for their cus
tomers, communities, coworkers, and other stakeholders. Mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change presents opportunitiesfor growth for the Utility’s bus
iness and economic opportunity for the communities it serves.The Utility strives to
 be prepared to continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy in the face of increasingly severe and extreme climate-drivennatural hazards. To build r
esilience to these hazards, the Utility is working to systematically integrate the consideration of forward-looking climate data and toolsin its decision-making. PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility also work with policymakers and regulators to advance effective climate adaptation policy in California,and work directly with local gov
ernments and communities on adaptation solutions.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e an important enabler of California’s effort to reduce GHG emissions. California has set a goal to achieve economy-widecarbon neutrality no la
ter than 2045. SB 100 increased California’s RPS target to 60% by the end of 2030 and requires 100% of retail sales to come from eligiblerenewables or zero-ca
rbon resources by the end of 2045.The impacts of climate change
 on the Utility’s infrastructure are already a reality. Record-breaking extreme heat and heat waves are increasingly a regularoccurrence throughout 
California. Peak loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on equipmentand direct impacts on e
lectricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage. The Utility’s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds facepotential increased expos
ures to coastal, riverine, and precipitation-related flooding because of climate-driven changes in precipitation and sea-level rise.Climate change will also 
continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California. The worsening conditions across California increase the likelihoodand severity of wildfires, 
including those where the Utility’s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire’s ignition. Reducing risk will be even moreimportant as clima
te change continues to exacerbate the risks facing the Utility. A key element of preparing the Utility for the physical risks of climate change is asystem-wide CVA of the Utility’s asse
ts, operations, and services, which the Utility expects to file with the CPUC in 2024. The CVA is expected to improve theUtility’s understanding of i
ts exposure to climate hazards and the sensitivity of assets and operations to these hazards.15

The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-ownedgeneration and energy 
storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment bycustomers and third part
ies of distributed energy resources, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and load managementtechnologies. These developm
ents will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energystorage options, and EV infrastru
cture. To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electricdistribution grid in order 
to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources and consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcementinvestments; evaluat
e if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities wouldbe appropriate for enablin
g those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator.PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to pursue policies and programs that enable safe, reliable, and affordable clean and resilient energy for their customers.As a result of actions alr
eady taken by PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the companies have:•
Exceeded California’s renewable portfolio standards goal for each utility (including the Utility) to deliver 33 percent of eligible renewable energy by theend of 2020, and delivered cle
an electricity to customers in 2021 that was more than 90% GHG free.•
Helped customers avoid emissions through energy efficiency programs, supporting California’s goal to double energy efficiency in existing buildings by2030.
•
Awarded contracts for more than 1.7 GWs of battery energy storage, strengthening California’s grid efficiency and reliability.•
Installed approximately 5,000 charging ports for EVs at workplaces and multi-family dwellings, including installing 39% of these charging ports indisadvantaged communiti
es, and also offered programs to support medium- and heavy-duty fleets and public fast charging in support of California’s goalof 100 percent sales of ligh
t-duty zero-emission vehicles by 2035.•
Brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to more than 600,000 and supported more than 33,000 customers who have installedbattery storage at th
eir homes or businesses.•
Pursued decarbonization initiatives for the Utility’s natural gas delivery system, including working to interconnect several renewable natural gas projects.Looking ahead, the Utility expe
cts its GHG-free energy supply mix of renewable, large hydroelectric, and nuclear generation resources to remain elevated whileDiablo Canyon continues to operate. Onc
e Diablo Canyon ceases operations in 2025, the Utility expects its percentage of GHG-free electricity to decreasesubstantially. The CPUC coordinates the p
lanning of supply resources through the Integrated Resource Planning (“IRP”) proceeding and has determined thatreplacing the power gener
ated by Diablo Canyon is the responsibility of all LSEs within the CAISO. Towards the end of the decade and beyond, the Utility’sGHG-free energy supply mix is expec
ted to grow relative to 2025 levels as the Utility works to meet California’s IRP GHG emissions reduction targets and its RPStarget. For more inform
ation, see “Integrated Resource Planning Procurement” below.Prosperity
The prosperity element o
f the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providingeconomic development oppor
tunities and benefits in the communities they serve. Management believes clean energy should be affordable for and inclusive of alleconomic backgrounds.
The Utility operates u
nder a “cost of service ratemaking model,” which means that rates for electric and natural gas utility services are generally set at levels thatare intended to allow the Ut
ility to recover its costs of providing service and have the opportunity to earn a return on invested capital. Under cost of serviceratemaking, a utili
ty’s earnings depend on the outcomes of its ratemaking proceedings and its ability to manage costs.16

In order to set rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the amount that the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers(“revenue requirem
ents”). Revenue authorized by the CPUC through GRC proceedings is intended to provide the Utility a reasonable opportunity to recover itscosts and earn a return on i
ts investments in generation and distribution assets and general plant (also referred to as “rate base”) on a forecast basis. The Utility’srevenue requirements consi
st primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administrationand general expenses) and c
apital costs (e.g., depreciation, taxes, and financing expenses). In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues torecover costs that the Ut
ility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7.MD&A), including its costs to procur
e electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer programs.The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. The rate of return on all other Utility assets is set in theCPUC’s cost of capital proceeding. Othe
r than certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volumethrough certain regula
tory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are designed to allow the Utility to collect its authorized base revenuerequirements regard
less of sales volume. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather oreconomic conditions. The Util
ity’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues andCosts that Impacted Earnings
” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.See “Ratemaking Mechanisms
” below and “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC and FERC proceedings.Generally, differenc
es between forecast costs and actual costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations in Item7. MD&A) can occur for numerous re
asons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials. Differencesin costs can also arise f
rom changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. The Utility has initiated a program to reduce its spending onoperations and maintenance.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e committed to taking steps to improve their credit ratings and metrics over time, including by reducing their debt. PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e set goals to reduce their debt over time, including reducing PG&E Corporation’s debt by $2 billion by the end of 2023. PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp
ect that reducing the consolidated debt will help them achieve investment grade credit ratings for their unsecured securities, for thebenefit of both customers 
and investors. For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Additionally, the Utilityfiled an application wi
th the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs. Among other uses,as a result of the proposed t
ransaction, the Utility would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debt. For more information, see “Application for Post-EmergenceSecuritization Transa
ction” in Item 7. MD&A.On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, as wel
l as the Utility’s preferred stock. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to issue dividends is subject to restrictions. OnFebruary 8, 2022, the Board of Directors o
f the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. For moreinformation, see “Dividends
” in Item 7. MD&A.Total capital expendi
tures (including accruals) recorded in 2021 were $8.6 billion. The Utility’s total capital expenditures (including accruals) are forecasted to bebetween $7.8 billion and $8.9 billion 
for 2022, between $7.9 billion and $10.4 billion for 2023, between $7.9 billion and $10.7 billion for 2024, between $8.0billion and $11.3 billion for 2025, and b
etween $8.1 billion and $12.0 billion for 2026. The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associatedcost recovery may be affected
 by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal andregulatory approvals and dev
elopments, community requests or protests, weather and other unforeseen conditions.The Utility expects to mak
e additional CPUC capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval, including the 2023 GRC.These expenditures include 
capital expenditures exceeding amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC, and expenditures to be included in a later stage of the 2023 GRC.The 2023 through 2026 currently above au
thorized capital spending levels are primarily for additional wildfire mitigation, transportation electrification and theLakeside Building. Additionally, $3.21 bi
llion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures will be excluded from the Utility’s equity rate base pursuant to AB 1054.17

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to keeping gas and electric services affordable for all customers. The Utility’s capital investment plan, increasingprocurement of renewabl
e power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirementscollectively plac
e continuing upward pressure on customer rates. Certain CPUC proceedings, such as the OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs, could impactdifferent types of custo
mers differently. Similarly, although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as “pass-through” costs, commodity pri
ces rose substantially in 2021, relative to 2020. The Utility is addressing this customer rate pressure with cost reductions throughincreased effici
ency, including efficiency driven by implementing the Lean operating system, improving its work management, identifying additional opportunitiesto convert expenses to capi
tal expenditures, and an improved organizational design. The Utility has a number of programs in place to assist low-income customers,such as the CARE program. Under the CARE program, incom
e-qualified customers can receive a monthly discount of 20% or more on their gas and electric bill.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Corpo
rate Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies’ progress toward world-classperformance measur
ed with the triple bottom line framework.In 2020, the Utility spent $3.9 bill
ion with certified diverse suppliers, representing 38.9% of its total spend.Performance: Underpinning The Triple Bottom Line
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e transitioning to the Lean operating system, which includes four basic “plays”: visual management, operating reviews,problem solving and standard work. PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility have implemented the first two plays in 2021 and expect to roll out the second two plays in2022. Visual management allows t
eams to see how they are performing against their most important metrics using real-time data. During 2021, PG&E Corporationand the Utility have set up ove
r 2,000 daily operating reviews, beginning with crews closest to the work and cascading up to senior leadership. These briefmeetings help the Utili
ty identify gaps and quickly develop plans to support the teams performing the work and give the Utility more visibility, control andpredictability in i
ts operations. For instance, the Lean operating system helped the Utility identify patterns in the conditions of ignitions and led to theimplementation of EPSS. PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s performance is also driven by an increased focus on alignment on shared outcomes among itsleadership and within the org
anization.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
implemented a regional operating model to place more co-workers and operational leadership closer to their customers.The purposes of regionaliza
tion are to address local issues faster; reduce outage response times; create faster interconnections for customers connecting solar ordistributed energy to the g
rid; and build stronger relationships and information flow between the companies and their customers.California has experien
ced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years and the Utility’s service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity. Inresponse, the Utility has imp
lemented operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including:•
Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings: In 2021, the Utility implem ented the EPSS program, which adjusts the sensitivity of circuit protection devices oncertain power lines to de
-energize them more rapidly in the event of a disturbance to help prevent potential ignitions. After EPSS was initiated, CPUC-reportable ignitions wer
e reduced substantially on EPSS-enabled circuits, compared to the prior three-year average.•
Public Safety Power Shutoffs: The PSPS program proactively de-ene rgizes power lines in response to forecasted weather conditions. Since its inception inlate 2017, the PSPS program has become mo
re targeted because the Utility has developed more granular risk models, including adding consideration ofvegetation managemen
t and maintenance tag statuses for scoping PSPS events. The Utility has also installed sectionalizers for more strategic de-energizations of cir
cuits and transmission lines.•
Vegetation management: The Utility inspects its ove rhead electric distribution and transmission facilities on an annual basis to identify and clearvegetation that might g
row or fall into utility equipment. In addition, the Utility operates an EVM program for distribution facilities in HFTD areas. TheUtility is also increas
ing oversight and engagement with the contractors supporting vegetation management work.•
Asset inspections: Since 2018, the Utility has reor iented its asset inspections programs toward asset condition and consequence risk, particularly wildfirerisk, and have become more 
thorough, standardized, digitized, and verifiable. The Utility uses risk-informed inspection cycles. In 2021, the Utilitycontinued to refine its 
risk modeling, including further incorporating data from asset inspections.18

•System hardening: System hardening entails r eplacing or eliminating existing distribution lines in HFTDs and installing stronger and more resilientequipment. Hardening methods in
clude replacing bare overhead conductor with covered conductor and installing stronger poles, removing the line andserving our customers through r
emote grids, or converting the line from overhead to underground. In 2021, the Utility announced a commitment tounderground 10,000 miles of elec
tric distribution lines in HFTDs, which will eliminate ignition risks from overhead vegetation or wind-inducedequipment failures in 
those areas and help reduce the need for vegetation management.Even as the Utility works to mit
igate wildfire risk, it also works to reduce the impact of those mitigations on its customers, including making the PSPS programless disruptive through sect
ionalizing devices for both distribution and transmission lines, temporary generation applications, and implementation of microgridpilot technologies. For examp
le, in 2021, the CPUC authorized the Utility to prepare 10 substations to form microgrids in the event of PSPS outages impacting thetransmission lines feed
ing those substations, in addition to nine other distribution microgrids that the Utility made ready to operate in 2021. Two of the distributionmicrogrids piloted bat
tery storage and a linear generator in a hybrid configuration with diesel generation to assist in energizing the microgrids when needed.Through these and other mitig
ation actions, PSPS events in 2021 impacted 78% fewer customers on average than PSPS events in 2019. The Utility also broughtonline its first “re
mote grid” in 2021, which allows distribution lines in HFTDs to be removed and replaced with locally sited resources. Remote grids can reducecosts and fire risks, while m
aintaining service to impacted customers. The Utility is pursuing the development of additional remote grid projects.In 2021, the Utility also worked to r
educe the impact of EPSS by adjusting the sensitivity of devices to reduce the likelihood of an outage, improving coordinationbetween its devices to redu
ce the size of outages, and improving internal coordination of patrol crews for faster restoration times. In 2022, the Utility plans toexpand the scope of the EPSS program to a
ll HFTD areas.The Utility has focused on continuous
ly improving its gas operations safety record. Since the San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010, the Utility’s assetsafety efforts have in
cluded replacing distribution mains and transmission pipelines, as well as strength testing transmission pipelines. The Utility uses in-lineinspections to assess the int
egrity of transmission pipelines. The Utility also uses safety and control systems to monitor, gather, and process real-time data on itsgas system. In 2021, the Utility’s g
as operations achieved zero workforce serious injuries and fatalities (“SIF-A”) incidents and reductions in the number of injuriesthat result in days away, res
tricted or transferred duty per 200,000 hours worked (“DART”). As of the date of this filing, the Utility’s gas system has not had apublic safety-related incident t
hat resulted in a fatality or injury since 2015 or 2018, respectively.The Utility has engaged in educ
ating employees, contractors, and the public regarding safe digging programs and practices for their awareness during constructionand when digging near the Utility
’s underground gas and electric assets. The Utility also installed safety devices that automatically detect increasing pressure onsystems and stop the flow of gas to avo
id outages and overpressure events. Additionally, the Utility continues to streamline its efforts to respond to outages timely.The Utility’s outage response 
is designed to keep the public safe while limiting customer outages and returning service safely and as quickly as possible.The Utility’s generation op
erations have focused on safety and reliability. In 2021, the Utility’s generation operations achieved zero SIF-A incidents and reductionsin DART. Challenged by a drought year, the Util
ity scheduled dispatch and rescheduled outages to maximize availability during the summer months when demandfor electricity is highest. 
The Utility is working to implement a comprehensive generation asset management strategy and further mature its outage and projectmanagement capabilities.
Regulatory Environment 
The Utility’s business is subjec
t to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC. At the federa
l level, the Utility is regulated primarily by the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of otherfederal, state and lo
cal regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health, such as the NTSB and OEIS.This section and the “Environm
ental Regulation” and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” sections below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations,and regulatory proceedings 
affecting the Utility. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.19

PG&E Corporation is a “public utility holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversightby the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries a
re exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than theobligation to provide acc
ess to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.California Public Utilities Commiss
ionThe CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions ofservice for the Utili
ty’s electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The CPUC also hasexercised jurisdict
ion over the Utility’s issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility’s electric andnatural gas retail 
customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providingelectric and natur
al gas utility service.The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utilitygas and electric fa
cilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $100,000 per day, per violation. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount ofpenalties based on the tot
ality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the numberof persons affected; and 
the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required toconsider the appropriat
eness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu
e citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports. Underthe current gas and ele
ctric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation; but ifit assesses a penalty for 
a violation, it has the authority to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $100,000 per day, with an administrative limit of $8 millionper citation issued. Simi
lar to penalties imposed by the CPUC, penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs arethe responsibility of shar
eholders of an issuer and may not be recovered in rates or otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers. The CPUC has alsoauthorized the SED to propose for CPUC approval ad
ministrative consent orders and administrative enforcement orders when the SED deems a formal OIIunnecessary.
The California State Legis
lature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,increasing renewable en
ergy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHGemissions, the establishm
ent of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide EV charging infrastructure. The CPUC is responsible forapproving funding and administr
ation of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. The CPUC alsoconducts audits and reviews of th
e Utility’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.The CPUC has imposed various conditions that gove
rn the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financialconditions that require PG&E Corpor
ation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary andprudent to meet the Util
ity’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. For more information on specific CPUC enforcementmatters and CPUC-implemented

The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay. See “Electricity Resources” below. NRC regulations require extensive monitoring andreview of the safety, rad
iological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority toimpose fines or to force 
a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both. NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capitalexpenditures at Diablo Canyon, and subst
antial capital expenditures could be required in the future. For more information about Diablo Canyon, see Item 1A. RiskFactors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consol
idated Financial Statements in Item 8.Other Regulators
The California Energy Commission 
is California’s primary energy policy and planning agency. The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over50 MW within California. The CEC also is r
esponsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities’electricity procurement plans an
d for adopting building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.The CARB is the state agency responsible 
for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California. See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and ClimateChange” below.
The NTSB is an independent U.S. government investig
ative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigations, including pipeline accidents. TheNTSB also conducts special investiga
tions and safety studies, and issues safety recommendations to prevent future accidents.The California Geologic Energy M
anagement Division is the state agency responsible for establishing and enforcing regulations for the operation of the Utility’sunderground gas storage wells.
The OEIS is a state agency responsib
le for reviewing and approving the Utility’s WMP and for evaluating the Utility’s implementation of the WMP.21

In addition, the Utility obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility’s generation facilities,electricity transmission lines,
 natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities. The Utility also periodically obtains permits,authorizations, and lic
enses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy or use public property for theoperation of the Utility
’s business and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties thatpermit the Utility to 
install, operate, and maintain the Utility’s electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right to usepublic streets and highways, the Ut
ility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,with no expiration date. For mor
e information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.Third-party Monitors
On April 12, 2017, the Utility retain
ed the Monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017federal crimina
l conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by the Monitor for a period offive years.  On January 25, 2022, the per
iod of probation expired and the Monitor’s oversight of the Utility ended. For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factorsand “US District Court Matters and Prob
ation” under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.Additionally, as a condition to 
its approval of the Plan, the CPUC required the appointment of an independent safety monitor (the “Independent Safety Monitor”)for a term of five ye
ars, subject to extension if the CPUC determines that the Utility’s safety conditions would benefit from an Independent Safety Monitor’scontinued involvement. On January 28, 2022, 
the CPUC announced that it had selected Filsinger Energy Partners to serve as the Independent Safety Monitor.According to the scope of work author
ized by the CPUC, the Independent Safety Monitor will (1) monitor and alert CPUC staff whether the Utility isimplementing its highest 
priority and risk-driven safety mitigations and (2) monitor the Utility’s safety-related recordkeeping and record management systems. Inaddition to confidentia
l updates to the CPUC staff regarding safety-related concerns, the Independent Safety Monitor will also provide public summary reports ofits activities to th
e CPUC every six months.Material Effects of Compliance wi
th Governmental RegulationsAs indicated above, the Utili
ty’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Compliance with suchextensive government regu
lations requires substantial expenditures and has had in the past and may continue to have in the future a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position. Generally, the Utility expects to recover thecost of compliance with gove
rnment regulations through rates in its GRC proceedings, or other proceedings. To the extent the Utility incurs costs above authorizedor incurs additional types o
f costs not included in rates, the Utility would expect to apply for recovery of such costs. Such recovery would be subject to the CPUC’sapproval and could involve its 
reasonableness review.Costs incurred in 2021 included costs 
in connection with upgrading and maintaining the Utility’s electric and natural gas infrastructure in accordance with CPUCand federal require
ments, participating in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, execution of wildfire mitigation initiatives, the licensing and other regulations of theFERC, environmental regulations, c
lean energy standards, regulations regarding Diablo Canyon, and various other generation, distribution and storage regulations,the amount of which was substantia
l.If the Utility is unable 
to recover these costs or incurs fines or penalties as a result of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position could be materially impacted. For more information, see Item 1A.Risk Factors, “Regulatory Matte
rs” in Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.22

Environmental RegulationThe Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety andhealth of the Utility’s p
ersonnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous andradioactive substances
; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO and other GHG emissions; the transpor tation,handling, storage and disposal of sp
ent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penaltiesfor violation of these l
aws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirementsalso may require the Uti
lity, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Generally, the Utility recovers most of thecosts of complying with environm
ental laws and regulations through the Utility’s rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with theclean-up of most sites th
at contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation
The Utility’s facili
ties are subject to various regulations adopted by the EPA, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by other federal agenciesresponsible for implem
enting federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of Californiaand various state and loca
l agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of thesite where the releas
e occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporatesuccessors. Under the Comprehensive Env
ironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as “potentially responsible parties”) maybe jointly and severally 
liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to natural resources, and paying forthe costs of health studies.
The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the Utilitymay be responsible for re
mediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the California DTSC, several Cali
fornia regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurredsignificant environmen
tal remediation liabilities associated with former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressorstations are located, 
and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’s Hinkleyand Topock natural gas compresso
r stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is responsible forremediating this groundwat
er contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.For more information about 
environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Air Quality and Climate Change
The Utility’s electr
ic generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,including the federal Cl
ean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to theformation of ground-leve
l ozone, carbon dioxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), particulate ma tter, and other emissions.Federal Regulation
At the federal level, 
the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts toaddress climate chang
e through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.22
2 x 23

Tackling the climate crisis is a key priority of the Biden Administration, and the Administration has signaled its intent to use its executive and regulatoryauthorities to reduce 
emissions in line with science-based targets. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an EO directing the EPA to consider suspending,revising or rescinding the T
rump Administration’s rule for methane emissions from new sources in the oil and gas sector and propose a companion regulation forexisting sources, including th
e transmission, processing and storage segments of the industry. For power plants, the EPA is expected to propose a more stringentGHG standard for existing sources in th
e wake of challenges to the Trump Administration’s Affordable Clean Energy rule.State Regulation
California’s AB 32, the Global War
ming Solutions Act of 2006, provided for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. TheCARB has approved various regulations to ach
ieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade programthat sets gradually dec
lining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of theeconomy.
The cap-and-trade progr
am’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electric generation and large industrial sectors. In thesubsequent compliance per
iod, which began on January 1, 2015, the scope of the regulation was expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors,effectively cover
ing all of the state economy’s major sectors through 2020. The Utility’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHGemissions attributable to t
he combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than large natural gas delivery customers that are separatelyregulated as covered en
tities and have their own compliance obligation.In 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-and-tr
ade program through January 1, 2031. During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., therights to emit GHGs) equal to the 
amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year. Entities with a compliance obligation can obtain allowances from the CARB atquarterly auctions or f
rom third parties or exchanges. Complying entities may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offsetcredits (e.g., credits 
for GHG reductions achieved by third parties, such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers, that occur outside of the entities’ facilitiesthrough CARB-qualified offset proje
cts such as reforestation or biomass projects). The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed 
through to customers.SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensure a 40% reduc
tion in GHGs by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The California RPS program that requires utilities togradually increase th
e amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California. In September 2018,SB 100 was signed into law, which accelera
ted California’s 50% RPS target to December 31, 2026, increased the RPS target to 60% by December 31, 2030, andfurther amended the RPS statut
e to set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.Additionally, EO B-55-18 set a statewid
e goal to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045 and to maintain net negative emissions thereafter. The Utilitywill be an active part
icipant in regulatory proceedings to determine how the state will achieve carbon neutrality. For the percentage of the Utility’s estimated totalnet deliveries of electricity to c
ustomers in 2021, including estimated GHG-free and renewable energy percentages, see “Electric Utility Operations-ElectricityResources” below.
Climate Change Resilience Strateg
iesDuring 2021, the Utility continued i
ts programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to takeactions to increase its resilie
nce to the physical impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations. The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant scientificliterature on cli
mate change such as rising sea levels, major storm events, increasing temperatures and heatwaves, wildfires, drought and land subsidence, to helpthe Utility identify and
 evaluate climate change-related risks and develop resilience strategies. The Utility maintains emergency response plans and procedures toaddress a range of near-
term risks, including wildfires, extreme storms, and heat waves and considers climate hazards in its risk-assessment process to account forlong-term risks associa
ted with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders from business, government, academia, and non-profit organizations to shareinformation and plan for 
the future.The Utility is continuing its work 
to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change. Climate change is incorporated into the Utility’s RiskAssessment Mitigation Phase (“RAMP”) f
iling, which describes its quantitative risk modeling process and major risks. The Utility also considers the RAMPanalysis in developing its in
frastructure investment plans. Additionally, the Utility is conducting a system-wide CVA focused on 2050 to identify and helpprioritize the Util
ity’s climate-driven hazards. Concurrent with the CVA are efforts to align key processes with the best available climate projections. For example,the Utility is current
ly reviewing and updating equipment design standards that rely on historically observed heat thresholds, which are not expected to bepredictive of future temperatures.
24

With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due to more extreme and frequent hotweather. The Utility beli
eves its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand response programs, infrastructure improvements, andthe use of renewable energy 
and energy storage will help it adapt to the expected changes in demand for electricity. The Utility is making substantial investmentsto build a more resilient 
system that can better withstand extreme weather and related emergencies. For more information on such investments, see “Performance:Underpinning The Triple Bottom Line
” above. Over the long term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coastal and lowelevation facili
ties due to projected sea level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges. Inland areas, such as near the Sacramento-San JoaquinRiver Delta, will also be vulne
rable to flooding amid changes to precipitation patterns and extreme storms. As the state continues to face increased risk ofwildfires, the Utility’s wi
ldfire mitigation activities, including vegetation management and undergrounding electric powerlines, will continue to play an importantrole to help reduce the 
risk of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.Climate scientists predict that
 climate change will result in rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns in the Utility’s service territory, includingdecreasing snowpack. This could, in tu
rn, affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation. This issue is being analyzed as part of the Utility’s CVA. To plan for thischange, the Utility is engag
ing with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting strategies such as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels,reducing discretionary 
reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research and new modeling tools.With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane intothe atmosphere. The Utili
ty has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reducethe pressure and volume of na
tural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions byimplementing improvements in
 leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipelinematerials. The Utili
ty is also actively engaged with renewable natural gas producers to facilitate supply interconnections with the Utility’s natural gas pipelinesystem and is participa
ting in CPUC proceedings that evaluate standards to allow for the injection of hydrogen into natural gas systems and decarbonizationthrough electrification.
Emissions Data
PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-profit organi
zation. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2020, which is the most recentdata available, tot
aled more than 44 million metric tons of CO equivalent, the major ity of which came from customer natural gas use. The following table showsthe 2020 GHG emissions data the Utility 
reported to the CARB under AB 32, which is the most recent data available. PG&E Corporation and the Utility alsopublish additional GHG emissions data 
in their annual Corporate Sustainability Report.Source

Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts underwhich the DOE would be required to dispose of th
e utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by theutilities’ custome
rs. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nucleargenerating units at Diablo Canyon 
and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store itsspent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon 
and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel. The Utility and othernuclear power plant owners sued th
e DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.In September 2012, the U.S. Department o
f Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submitsannual requests for rei
mbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, totaled approximately$11.6 million and is current
ly under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates. Considerable uncertaintycontinues to exist regard
ing when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spentfuel.
Ratemaking Mechanisms
The Utility’s rates for electric
 and natural gas utility services are generally set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing serviceand a return on invested cap
ital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). In order to set rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the amount that theUtility will be authorize
d to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set toenable the Utility to r
ecover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, andfinancing expenses). In addi
tion, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers(referred to as “Uti
lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customersand to administer public pu
rpose and customer programs.The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. The rate of return on all other Utility assets is set in theCPUC’s cost of capital proceeding. Othe
r than certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volumethrough certain regula
tory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are designed to allow the Utility to collect its authorized base revenuerequirements regard
less of sales volume. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather oreconomic conditions. The Util
ity’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues andCosts that Impacted Earnings
” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.Due to the seasonal nature of 
the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May to October) because ofhigher demand, driven by air 
conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service are generally higher during winter months (November to March) because ofhigher demand due to heating.
From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues. For example, theUtility has earned incen
tives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.2 2 
26

See “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.Base Revenues
General Rate Cases
The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect fromcustomers to recover th
e Utility’s anticipated costs related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-owned electric generation operations andreturn on rate base. In th
e past, the CPUC has generally conducted a GRC every three years. Starting with the 2023 GRC, the CPUC will conduct a GRC every fouryears that includes the Ut
ility’s costs of its gas transmission and storage facilities. The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or “testyear”) of the GRC period and typic
ally authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period(known as “attrition 
years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generally authorized for cost increases related to invested capital and inflation. Parties in theUtility’s GRC include the Public Advocat
es Office of the CPUC (formerly known as Office of Ratepayer Advocates or ORA) and TURN, which generallyrepresent the overal
l interests of residential customers, as well as numerous intervenors, that represent other business, community, customer, environmental, andunion interests. For more info
rmation about the Utility’s GRC, see “Regulatory Matters - 2020 General Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters - 2023 General RateCase” in Item 7. MD&A.
Cost of Capital Proceedings
The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of 
capital proceeding to authorize the Utility’s capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. The CPUC’s cost of capital proceedings generally take place in a consolidatedproceeding with California
’s other large investor-owned electric and gas utilities. For more information about the cost of capital proceedings, see “RegulatoryMatters - Cost of Capital Proc
eedings” in Item 7. MD&A.Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. In its TO rate cases, the Utility uses a formula rate methodology, which includes an authorized revenue requirement and rate base for agiven year but also provides fo
r an annual update of the following year’s revenue requirement and rates in accordance with the terms of the FERC-approvedformula. Under the form
ula rate mechanism, transmission revenue requirements are updated to the actual cost of service annually as part of the true-up process.Differences between amoun
ts collected and determined under the formula rate are either collected from or refunded to customers. The FERC-approved formularate will be effec
tive through December 31, 2023. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility’s retail electric rates and by the CAISO inits Transmission Access Charges to whol
esale customers. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.The Utility also recovers 
a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts withwholesale transmission custo
mers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are charged individualized ratesbased on the terms of thei
r contracts.Program-Specific Memorandum Account and Balancing A
ccount CostsPeriodically, costs aris
e outside of the CPUC GRC rate requests or that have been deliberately excluded therefrom. These costs may result from catastrophicevents, changes in regulat
ion, new programs, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in amemorandum account and th
e CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed reasonable. For instance, theseaccounts allow the Utility 
to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. Recovery ofthe costs tracked in thes
e memorandum accounts in rates requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings for which the Utility may be unable to predict theoutcome. Alternatively, 
the Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs related to these non-GRC programs in balancing accounts. The CPUC mayauthorize recovery of 
costs tracked in the balancing accounts on either a “one-way” basis, which only allows actual costs to be recovered up to a pre-establishedcap, or a “two-way” basis, which al
lows actual costs to be recovered, subject to CPUC review. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Cost RecoveryProceedings” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 4 of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.27

Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through CostsElectricity Procurement Costs
California IOUs are re
sponsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins, that are not satisfiedfrom their own generation 
facilities and existing electric contracts. The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, includingcertain electricity procured from thir
d parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., usingthe principles of “le
ast-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their BPPs based on long-term demand forecasts. InOctober 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s mos
t recent comprehensive BPP. It was revised since its initial approval and will remain in effect as revised untilsuperseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.
California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BPPs without further after-the-fact reasonablenessreview by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with 
electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approvedplan or if the CPUC determines tha
t the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the value of lostgeneration due to unplanned out
ages at utility-owned generation facilities.The Utility recovers its 
electric procurement costs annually primarily through balancing accounts. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8. Ea
ch year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHGemissions costs, and generat
ion fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric rates morefrequently if the for
ecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the Energy Resource Recovery Account, net of Portfolio Allocation BalancingAccount balances, exceed f
ive percent of its prior year electric procurement and Utility-owned generation revenues. The CPUC performs an annual compliancereview of the procuremen
t transactions recovered in various balancing accounts, including the Energy Resource Recovery Account and the Portfolio AllocationBalancing Account.
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedBPP, to meet mandatory renewable 
energy targets, and to comply with RA requirements. For more information, see “Electric Utility Operations - ElectricityResources” below as well as Note 15 of th
e Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.The Utility is also responsibl
e, as the central procurement entity (“CPE”) for its distribution service area, for seeking to procure the entire amount of required localRA on behalf of all load serving en
tities in its distribution service area. The decision grants the Utility, acting as CPE, discretion to defer procurement of localresources to the CAISO’s backstop mech
anisms if bid costs are deemed unreasonably high. The Utility, as the CPE, will not be assessed fines or penalties forfailing to procure resou
rces to meet the local RA requirements and deferring local procurement to the CAISO backstop mechanism, as long as the CPE exercisedreasonable efforts to s
ecure capacity and certain specified requirements are met. In connection with its CPE function, the Utility is responsible for makingcompliance demonstra
tions to the CPUC and the CAISO. The Utility recovers its administrative and procurement costs associated with its CPE function through abalancing account. Each ye
ar, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted administrative costs related to the CPE function and approves a forecasted revenuerequirement associa
ted with the administrative costs. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the CPE function, including procurement transactionswith terms of five years o
r less (for which costs incurred in compliance with certain prescribed criteria are deemed reasonable and pre-approved without furtherafter-the-fac
t reasonableness review). Procurement transactions with terms exceeding five years are reviewed separately. The CPUC may disallow costs associatedwith the CPE function that were not in
curred in compliance with the CPUC’s decisions and guidance.The CPUC has also approved the Power Charge Indiffe
rence Adjustment (“PCIA”). The PCIA is a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that customers who switchfrom the Utility’s bundled s
ervice to a non-Utility provider, such as a DA or CCA provider, pay their share of the above market costs associated with long-termpower purchase commitmen
ts and Utility-owned generation made on their behalf.Natural Gas Procurement, Storage, and Transportation Costs
The Utility recovers the
 cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.28

The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instrumen
ts for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its CPIM described below. The Utility reflects thedifference between a
ctual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections andover-collections tak
en into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.The CPIM protects the Utility ag
ainst after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio. Under the CPIM, the Utility’snatural gas purchase costs 
for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthlyand daily natural gas pri
ce indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas. Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% ofthe commodity benchmark, 
are considered reasonable and are fully recovered through rates. One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverablethrough rates, and the Utili
ty’s customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of thebenchmark. The Utility re
tains the remaining amount of these savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.While this mechanism remains i
n place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact netincome.
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States)to the points at which the Util
ity’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by the FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules,and terms of service fo
r the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC approves the UnitedStates tariffs that sh
ippers, including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, aCanadian regulatory agency. Th
e transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gasprocurement costs or as a 
cost of electricity.Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer Programs
The CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utilitycustomers.  These programs r
elate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters. Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Ut
ility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under the CAREprogram, which is paid for by the Ut
ility’s other customers.Nuclear Decommissioning Costs
The Utility’s nuclear power 
facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of theproperty for unrestric
ted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to beused for the eventual deco
mmissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’supdated estimated deco
mmissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission theUtility’s nuclear plan
ts. If the nuclear decommissioning trusts are overfunded, the amount of such overfunding will be returned to customers. Pursuant to PublicUtilities Code Section 8325, to the 
extent the monies available for decommissioning are insufficient to pay for all reasonable and prudent decommissioning costs,the CPUC must authorize the elec
tric utility to collect these charges from its customers.For costs related to AROs see “Nuclea
r Decommissioning Obligation” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.29

Human CapitalEmployees and Contractors
As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had approximately 26,000 regular employees, 11 of whom were employees of PG&E Corporation.Of the Utility’s regular 
employees, approximately 16,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions: theInternational Brotherhood o
f Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245; the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”) IFPTE 20; and the Service EmployeesInternational Union Local 24
/7 (“SEIU”). The collective bargaining agreements currently in effect for the IBEW Local 1245 and ESC Local 20 will expire onDecember 31, 2025. The agreemen
ts increase wages annually by 3.75% from 2022 through 2025 and maintain current contributions to specified benefits. TheIBEW and ESC represent approximat
ely 62% of the Utility’s employee workforce and support several areas of the Utility’s business, including gas and electricoperations. The term of th
e SEIU bargaining agreement ended on December 31, 2021. The parties have reached an agreement which is pending ratification by theSEIU. The Utility enjoys stable and produ
ctive relationships with its unions and did not experience any work stoppages in 2021.PG&E Corporation’s employees are p
rimarily at the executive management level, which experienced significant employee turnover throughout the course of itsChapter 11 Cases in 2019 and 2020. The Utility gen
erally has a stable workforce, which translated into low voluntary turnover during that period. The Utility’sturnover rates for 2021 and 2020 wer
e 5.8% and 4.7%, respectively. Approximately 41% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees have a tenure ofmore than 10 years, with an ave
rage tenure of 11 years. Currently, approximately 21% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees are eligible to retire.(PG&E Corporation and the Utility de
fine retirement age as 55 years and older.)The Utility’s contracto
rs and subcontractors include approximately 35,300 individuals from approximately 1,560 contractor companies.Human Capital Management
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s hu
man capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitable workforce. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s Boards of Directors are responsible for overseeing management’s development and execution of PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s human capita
l strategy.To build employee engagemen
t, the Utility has a variety of both executive-level and employee-led initiatives and programs. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sexecutive teams meet regularly to
 discuss and evaluate the state of employee talent, determine which programs are driving engagement and performance, andclarify the specif
ic skills, behaviors, and values that should be cultivated. Each year, the Utility honors employees whose work embodies safety, diversity andinclusion, environmental 
leadership, and community service. The Utility conducts a biennial employee engagement survey, quarterly pulse surveys, and voluntaryupward feedback surveys to measu
re and track employee engagement progress.Every year, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity offer or require technical, leadership, and employee training, which includes a range of technical training foremployees on the knowledge and skil
ls required to perform their jobs safely using approved tools and work procedures. In addition, employees are required tocomplete an annual comp
liance and ethics training and a Code of Conduct training, both of which are intended to promote a culture in which employees areencouraged to speak up with any conc
erns or ideas for continuous improvement. In addition, the Utility offers a variety of other trainings and educationopportunities.
Among other programs, the Utili
ty provides career opportunities through its Power Pathway™ workforce development program. Launched in 2008, PowerPathwayis a workforce development 
model to enlarge the talent pool of local, qualified, diverse candidates for skilled craft and utility industry jobs through trainingprogram partnerships with edu
cational, community-based and government organizations. PowerPathway helps people throughout the Utility service territory,including women and milita
ry veterans, prepare and compete for high demand jobs in the utility and energy industry. Students receive approximately eight weeksof industry-informed curric
ulum to ensure the academic, job specific, employability skills and physical training necessary to effectively compete for entry-levelemployment. Programs may a
lso include hands-on training and on-the-job training.PG&E Corporation and the Utility also p
rovide integrated solutions and programs that cover employee health and wellness and that encompass physical,emotional, and financi
al health, including an on-site health clinic, an annual health screening, and health management tools and resources, in addition to moretraditional programs.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial incentives offered to employees include a Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”), an at-risk part of employeecompensation designed to rewa
rd eligible employees for achieving specific performance goals. The 2021 STIP was focused on company objectives of safety,customer impact, and f
inancial health.All PG&E Corporation or Utility offi
cer compensation currently is funded by shareholders.Safety
The Utility has developed a f
ive-year workforce safety strategy that includes two major pillars: systems and culture. Systems refers to risk management,equipment, processes and proc
edures. Culture refers to employee engagement, adherence to established requirements, a sense of urgency for safety, and leadership.Focus areas in the 
Utility’s workplace safety strategy include: an enterprise safety management system, enhanced risk management, strengthening the contractormanagement program, i
mprovement of safety technical standards, ergonomics, safety audits, improving data management and reporting systems, and enhancingsafety leadership tr
aining. For employees and contractors performing medium- and high-risk work, the Utility’s safety metrics include the number of SIF-Aincidents and the SIF-P rate, which 
measures events that could have resulted in a SIF-A per 200,000 hours worked. In 2021, the Utility had five SIF-A events,which resulted in three f
atalities and three serious injuries, and a SIF-P rate of 0.11, which was 10% higher than the SIF-P rate in 2020. The requirement forcontractors to report SIF-P ev
ents was implemented in June 2020. Additionally, the Utility measures DART. In 2021, the Utility’s DART was 1.01, which was25% lower than in 2020 and its lowest r
ate in the past five years.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility have continued to monitor activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand the World Health Organiz
ation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have updated their protocols and actions in accordance with guidance from theseorganizations, following sta
te and local health and safety regulations, and in consultation with the Utility’s medical director. PG&E Corporation and the Utilityhave also remained focus
ed on protecting the health and safety of their employees, contractors and the Utility’s customers, while continuing to perform criticalutility work, and have continued 
to monitor and track the impact of the pandemic, modifying or adopting new policies in support of their employees’ health andsafety as pandemic condi
tions and governmental response have changed. For example, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have directed employees to workremotely from home wher
e possible, implemented face coverings, physical distancing policies, and required a daily health check when an employee works outsidehis or her home, required vi
rtual ergonomic evaluations to ensure that employees working from home so do safely and ergonomically, provided additional COVID-19 safety resources for e
mployees who perform utility work in the field, and updated several of their employee benefits as a result of COVID-19, includinghealthcare benefi
ts and interim time off and leave policies that support the care and new educational environment of children during the pandemic.Diversity and Inclusion
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s go
al is to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment that enables all of their coworkers to bring their best selvesto work so that they can provide ex
ceptional customer service. These efforts are led by PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Executive Vice President, People,Shared Services and Supply Chain, with support f
rom the executive team. The People and Compensation Committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directorsreviews the companies’ div
ersity and inclusion practices and performance.Key elements of PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s approach include active programming to heighten cultural competency, encourage understanding andappreciation of diversity,
 and integrate thoughtful content into training and performance support materials.Additionally, the Utility’s 11 E
mployee Resource Groups and three Engineering Network Groups execute enterprise-wide programming, certain coworkers leadefforts within their departme
nts, and other specialized teams facilitate dialogue across the companies. These efforts foster employee belonging and support anenvironment of inclusion th
at values and respects diversity in the workforce.In 2021, women, minorities, and mi
litary veterans accounted for approximately 27%, 48% and 7%, respectively, of total PG&E Corporation and Utility employees.Approximately 8% of the Util
ity’s employees are younger than 30, 60% are between the ages of 30 and 49, and 32% are 50 or older.31

Electric Utility OperationsThe Utility generates electricity
 and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, comme
rcial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission, and distribution services) tocustomers in its servic
e territory. Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generationresources, such as rooftop sola
r installations. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.Electricity Resources
The Utility is required
 to maintain capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operatingreserves, deliverabl
e to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is responsible for scheduling and biddingelectric generation resources, i
ncluding certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand.The following table 
shows the percentage of the Utility’s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to customers in 2021 represented by each major electricresource, and further dis
cussed below. The Utility’s deliveries were primarily from renewable energy resources that qualify under California’s RPS and otherGHG-free resources (i.e., nucl
ear, and large hydroelectric generation). California’s RPS requirements and SB 100 goal to serve 100% of retail electricity sales withGHG-free resources by 2045 are discuss
ed further below and in the Environmental Regulation section above.The total estimated 
electricity generated, procured, and sold (net), as of December 31, 2021 was 33,149 GWhand comprised of the following: Percent of Bundled Retail

Renewable Energy ResourcesCalifornia law establish
ed an RPS that requires LSEs, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers. SB350 increased the amount of 
renewable energy that must be delivered by most LSEs, including the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual retailsales by the end of the 2017-2020 comp
liance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030 compliance period, and in each three-year compliance per
iod thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increasedflexibility to apply ex
cess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September 2018, the California Governorsigned SB 100 into law, increasing from 50
% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established state policy that100% of all retail e
lectricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may in the future incur additional costs to procurerenewable energy to mee
t the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable through rates as “pass-through” costs. TheUtility also may be subjec
t to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. The CPUC is required to open a new rulemaking proceeding to adopt regulations toimplement the higher 
renewable targets.Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy. RPS requirements are based on procurement, which aligns with the methodology presented in the first column of thetable above. Procurement 
from renewable energy sources was estimated as 50% in 2021.The estimated total 
renewable deliveries as of December 31, 2021 shown above was 16,387 GWh and comprised of the following:Type

justments, based on current CEC guidelines.Estimated renewable procurement percentages above and renewable compliance percentages are expected to be consistent; however, final RPS compl
iance reporting may result in somedifferences between the two percentages.
Energy Storage
Energy storage improves syste
m reliability and supports California’s decarbonization goals by integrating increased levels of renewable energy. The CPUC hasestablished a multi-y
ear energy storage procurement framework, under which the Utility was required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by the endof 2020, with all energy storage p
rojects required to be operational by the end of 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility was on track to meet its storage goalsby the end of 2024.
Additionally, the Utility has b
een actively procuring energy storage to meet critical reliability needs. The CPUC previously approved more than 1,100 MW ofstorage to come online in 2022 
and 2023. In January 2022, the Utility also requested CPUC approval for another 1,600 MW of storage to be completed by thesummer of 2024, which would bring the Util
ity’s total energy storage system capacity to more than 3,330 MW. Finally, the Utility expects to solicit 200 MW oflong-duration storage, which is s
torage with at least eight hours of discharge capacity, in 2022 to have these resources online between 2026 and 2028.(1)(2)(1)

The
 Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 103 generating units at 64 powerhouses. All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses notsubject to the FERC’s licensing requirements), with license terms be
tween 30 and 50 years.The
 Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solarstation
 (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW ), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW). All of these facilities are located inFresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.
Generation Resources from Third Parties
The Utility has entered in
to various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance withits CPUC-approved procurement plan. See 
“Ratemaking Mechanisms” above. For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.Electricity Transmission
At December 31, 2021, the Utility owned app
roximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500kV. The Utility also operated 33 e
lectric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 70,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system isinterconnected with el
ectric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian provinces ofAlberta and British Columbia, and p
arts of Mexico.Decisions about expansions and main
tenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility’s regulators and the CAISO.Electricity Distribution
The Utility’s electr
ic distribution network consists of approximately 108,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2021, approximately25% are underground and approxim
ately 75% are overhead), 67 transmission switching substations, and 753 distribution substations with a capacity ofapproximately 35,000 MVA. The Utility’s d
istribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations,where equipment reduces th
e high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’scustomers.

These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates electric distributioncontrol center fac
ilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilientgrid.

Natural Gas Utility Operations 
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Corecustomers can purchase na
tural gas procurement service (i.e.,  natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement serviceproviders (referred 
to as “core transport agents”).  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gasdelivery, metering and b
illing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combinedservice as “bundled” natu
ral gas service.  Currently, more than 96% of core customers, representing approximately 85% of the annual core market demand, receivebundled natural gas servic
e from the Utility.(1)  (2)

35

The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, which must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless thecustomer is a natural g
as-fired generation facility with which the Utility has a power purchase agreement that includes its generation fuel expense. The Utilityoffers backbone gas transm
ission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-corecustomers.  Access to the Util
ity’s backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  TheUtility also delivers gas 
to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.Natural Gas Supplies
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, andthe southwestern United States. The Ut
ility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customersdirectly from produce
rs and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gaspurchase contracts have v
aried generally based on market conditions. During 2021, the Utility purchased approximately 302,000 MMcf of natural gas (net of thesale of excess supply of gas). Substan
tially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s largest individualsupplier represented app
roximately 43% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2021.Natural Gas System Assets
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. AtDecember 31, 2021, the Utility’s n
atural gas system consisted of approximately 43,800 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,200 miles of backbone and localtransmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system andone small station on its lo
cal transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is us
ed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, Ltd. interconne
cting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System. The Foothills system interconnects at the border to thepipeline system owned by Gas Transmiss
ion Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’snatural gas transporta
tion system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,LLC to transport natural gas f
rom the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,Oregon, at the California bord
er. Similarly, the Utility has a firm transportation agreement with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC to transport natural gas fromsupply points in the southwestern United St
ates to interconnection points with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock,Arizona. (For more informa
tion regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.)
The Utility owns and operates thr
ee underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to theUtility’s gas transmission sys
tem.  In 2019, the CPUC approved the discontinuation, through closure or sale, of operations at two of the Utility’s owned andoperated gas storage fi
elds, Pleasant Creek and Los Medanos. The Utility expects to sell Pleasant Creek in 2022 in accordance with the CPUC’s final decision inthe 2019 GT&S rate case. The Utili
ty intends to retain the Los Medanos field to further support system supply reliability as proposed in the 2023 GRC. The Utilityowns and operates compressors and oth
er facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and later for withdrawal.  In addition,four independent storage ope
rators are interconnected to the Utility’s Northern California gas transmission system.In 2021, the Utility continued upgr
ading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final recommendationfrom the NTSB’s 2010-11 San Bruno investigation to hyd
rostatically test all high consequence pipeline mileage. The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSBrecommendation by 202
2 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmissionpipelines.

Competition
Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electr
icity IndustryCalifornia law allows quali
fying non-residential electric customers of IOUs to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilities up tocertain annual lim
its specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as DA. In 2018, the California legislature passed a bill to expand the annual statewideDA cap by 4,000 GWh and directed the CPUC to consider whethe
r DA should be further expanded. In addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certainother public agencies th
at have qualified to become a CCA to generate or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses. By law, a CCA can procureelectricity for 
all of its residents and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity generated or procured by a utility. In 2019, theCPUC issued an order implementing the 4,000 GWh 
increase for DA transactions, including an apportionment to the Utility’s service area of approximately 1,873GWh.
On June 24, 2021, the CPUC adopted a decision further i
mplementing the 2018 legislation. In that decision, the CPUC recommended against further legislativeexpansion of DA at this time. Although a CPUC staff 
report issued in September 2020 had recommended expanding DA at a rate of ten percent each year, theCPUC ultimately found that recen
t reliability events and the current integrated resource planning forecasted needs for additional generation prevented a need forfurther DA reopening. The CPUC found that expanded DA would resul
t in further fragmentation of the electric market in California and raise electric systemreliability conce
rns. Additionally, the CPUC based its recommendation in part on DA providers’ primary reliance on unspecified power sources, which it foundmay not support California’s 
climate goals. (1) (2)

The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to DA customers at the election of their energy service provider. TheCCA customers continue to obtain tr
ansmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from the Utility. In addition to collecting charges for transmission,distribution, metering, 
and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utilityincurred on behalf of DA and CCA customers whil
e they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort for thesecustomers. Section 387 of the Publi
c Utilities Code allows for a request to transfer the responsibilities of the provider of last resort obligation from IOUs to otherentities.
The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar ins
tallations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers employing qualifying renewable resources to receive billcredits at the full 
retail rate, are increasing, putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee,utilize time of use 
rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and otherprograms that other custo
mers pay. Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seekalternative energy p
roviders or adopt self-generation technologies. See “Rising rates for the Utility’s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility isunable to fully recover 
costs or earn its authorized ROE” in Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matters-OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs” in Item 7.MD&A.
Further, in some circum
stances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts may have authority under the state constitution or state statute toprovide retail ele
ctric service directly to consumers. Those entities may rely upon FERC open access tariffs and Utility infrastructure to deliver energy to them atwholesale rates for res
ale at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers. These entities may also seek to acquire the Utility’s transmission or distributionfacilities through e
minent domain for use in serving electricity at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers. During the Chapter 11 Cases, multipleentities communica
ted their interest in acquiring Utility assets through voluntary sales. It is also expected that some publicly-owned utilities will constructduplicate or new transmiss
ion or distribution facilities to serve existing or potential new Utility customers. In some instances, microgrid formation is a key factor ina community’s choice to e
ngage governmental entities.The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its serviceterritory through a comp
etitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.The effect of such type
s of retail competition generally is to reduce the number of utility customers, leading to a reduction in the Utility’s rate base.For risks in connection with incr
easing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
The Utility competes with oth
er natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis oftransportation rates, 
access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes forstorage services with othe
r third-party storage providers, primarily in Northern California.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accountingestimates described in Item 7
. MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financialresults.  The following discussion of k
ey risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read inconjunction with Item 7. MD&A and the Consol
idated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” ofthis 2021 Form 10-K.  Any of these factors, in whol
e or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows.Risk Factors Summary

The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effecti
vely mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.If the Utility does not have 
an approved WMP, the Utility will not be issued a safety certification and will consequently not benefit from the presumption ofprudency or the AB 1054 disallowance cap. Unde
r AB 1054, the Utility is required to maintain a safety certification issued by the OEIS to be eligible for certainbenefits, including a cap on 
Wildfire Fund reimbursement and a reformed prudent manager standard. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which capsthe amount of liability that
 the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that theelectric utili
ty company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,”or the electric utility company
 fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. In addition, if the Utility fails to maintain avalid safety certi
ficate at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility. The Utility will berequired to reimburse 
amounts that are determined by the CPUC not to be just and reasonable. For more information on the disallowance cap, see Note 14 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.Furthermore, the Wildf
ire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Suchfunds could be depleted more qu
ickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. If the Utilityis unable to maintain an AB 1054 saf
ety certification or if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, the ineffectiveness of the Wildfire Fund could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recoveryfrom the Wildfire Fund fo
r wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coveragerequired under AB 1054.
The costs of participat
ing in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year contribution period for the fund. The timing andamount of any potential ch
arges associated with the Utility’s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delaybetween the occurrence o
f a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of dataavailable to the Utility foll
owing a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another participating electric utility. Participationin the Wildfire Fund is expe
cted to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, and there can be no assuran
ce that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs.PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result o
f the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, or future wildfires.Based on the facts and circu
mstances available as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incurlosses in connection with the 2019 Kinc
ade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2021 Dixie fire. Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded liabilitiesfor probable losses in connec
tion with these fires, these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses, do not includeseveral categories o
f potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information.40

Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire’s causation determinations of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, and the 2021 Dixiefire, the Utility could b
e subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also received and have responded or areresponding to document, data, and o
ther information requests from the CPUC’s SED and law enforcement agencies that are investigating these wildfires. PG&ECorporation and the Utility cou
ld be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire o
r other wildfires. For more information, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Under California law (includ
ing Penal Code section 1202.4), if the Utility were convicted of any of the charges in the Kincade Amended Complaint or the ZoggComplaint, the sentencing cou
rt must order the Utility to “make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order” that is “sufficient tofully reimburse the vi
ctim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of” the Utility’s underlying conduct, in addition to interest and thevictim’s or victims
’ attorneys’ fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the government or the victims and is notoffset by any compen
sation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. In the event that the Utility were convicted of certaincharges in the Kincade Amended Comp
laint or the Zogg Complaint, the Utility currently believes that, depending on which charges it were to be convicted of, itstotal losses associated wi
th each of the Kincade Amended Complaint and the Zogg Complaint would materially exceed the $800 million and the $375 millionaggregate liabili
ty that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses for the2019 Kincade fire and 2020 Zogg fire 
civil claims, respectively. The Utility is currently unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such additionallosses. The Utility does not expec
t that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitution payments ordered by the court presiding over thecriminal proceeding.
There have also been numerous o
ther wildfires in the Utility’s service territory, of which the Utility has not been alleged or determined to be a cause. The Utilitycould be alleged or dete
rmined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires.Additionally, under the doctr
ine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whoseproperty was damaged through a publ
ic-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is unableto recover these costs th
rough rates. In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it had incurredas a result of the doctr
ine of inverse condemnation. Legal challenges to that denial were unsuccessful. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine ofinverse condemnation in
 lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility’s service territory. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (includingliability for attorneys’ fees) f
or damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines.While the Utility cur
rently continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successfulin challenging the appli
cability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, or other litigation against PG&ECorporation or the Utility.
Although the Utility has taken ex
tensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility’s equipment will be involved in the ignitionof future wildfires, inc
luding catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (inparticular extended p
eriods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Despitesignificant investment in miti
gation measures to improve infrastructure and manage vegetation, as well as implementation of de-energization strategies, the Utilitymay not be successful in mi
tigating the risk of future wildfires.In addition, wildfires have h
ad and, along with any future wildfires, could continue to have, adverse consequences on the Utility’s proceedings with the CPUC(including the Safety Cultur
e OII) and the FERC, and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications with the OEIS for the safety certificationrequired by AB 1054. PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, andregulatory environment 
as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire or any future wildfires. For more information about the 2019Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fir
e, and the 2021 Dixie fire, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.41

The Utility may be unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with wildfires from insurance, through rates, or from theWildfire Fund in a timely manner.
The Utility could incur substan
tial costs in excess of insurance coverage or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future inconnection with the 2019 Kincade f
ire, the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2021 Dixie fire. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs inexcess of insurance or amoun
ts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future either through FERC TO rates or as costs recorded to theWEMA, even if a court decision we
re to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. The inability torecover all or a signi
ficant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information on wildfire recovery risk, see “TheWildfire Fund and other provis
ions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires” above, “TheUtility’s insurance cove
rage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events and eventsresulting from these cond
itions (including wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all” below, and Note 14 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.The Utility may not
 effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives.The Utility’s infrastru
cture is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability. Although the Utility spends significant resources on initiatives designed tomitigate wildfire 
risks, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or effective in reducing wildfire-related losses or that their costs will be fullyrecoverable through rates.
 The Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service territory if it cannot effectively implement these effortsand its WMPs. 
For example, the Utility may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing,engaging, training, oversee
ing and retaining contract workers it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. The CPUC may assess penalties on theUtility if it finds tha
t the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMPs.There can be no assurance th
at the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives will be effective. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in conditionsthat do not trigger proac
tive de-energization according to criteria for initiating a PSPS event. The Utility’s inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detectstructural weaknesses 
within a tree or other issues. If the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread.The PSPS program has been subject to signif
icant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators, and lawmakers. The Utility alsois the subject of a class 
action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events.In addition, on a risk-infor
med basis, the Utility is making efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS. The Utility may be subject to mandated changes to,or restrictions on, its ope
rational practices, regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages, and reputational harm if the Utility does not execute PSPS incompliance with applic
able rules and regulations. The Utility establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent the Utility’scriteria for imp
lementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, the Utility does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to otheroverriding conditions or the Ut
ility’s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, the Utility will face a higherlikelihood of catastroph
ic wildfires in its territory during high-risk weather conditions.PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with its wildfire mitigationinitiatives. PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as toadditional litigat
ion and claims by customers as a result of the Utility’s implementation of its wildfire mitigation initiatives, which could result in fines, penalties,customer rebates or oth
er payments. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to issue anycredits, rebates or other 
payments in connection with any other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS and EPSS programs have had an adverseimpact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS and EPSS events may increase thesenegative perceptions. For mo
re information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.42

Risks Related to Operations and Information TechnologyThe Utility’s electri
city and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks.The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generatingsystem. See “Electric Ut
ility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. above. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects toconstruct, replace, and im
prove its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at theend of their useful opera
ting lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025. For more information, see “The operation anddecommissioning of the Util
ity’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costsif regulatory requirements or
 operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire” below.The Utility’s ability to
 efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely andreliably is subject to nu
merous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility’s control, including those that arise from:•
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines or other assets orgroup of assets, that can caus
e explosions, fires, public or workforce safety issues, large scale system disruption or other catastrophic events;•
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low;•
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life;•
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
•
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees, contractors, or the public,environmental damage, o
r reputational damage;•
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;•
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;•
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonablyshould have identified, as unsa
fe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wildfire or natural gas explosion);•
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm orextended outages;
•
operator or other human error;•
a motor vehicle or aviation incident involving a Utility vehicle or aircraft, respectively (or one operated on behalf of the Utility) resulting in seriousinjuries to or fatal
ities of the workforce or the public, property damage, or other consequences;•
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;•
construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that damage the Uti
lity’s underground pipelines, the risk of which may be exacerbated if the Utility does not have an effective contract managementsystem;
43

•the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and•
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. For more information, see “The Utility’s operational networks andinformation technology syst
ems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack” below.The occurrence of any of th
ese events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, cause unplanned outages or reduce generatingoutput, damage the Utility
’s assets or operations, damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies, damage property owned by customersor others, and cause personal 
injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and tocompensate third part
ies. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetationmanagement, or the constr
uction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may have less control over contractors than its employees and may retain liability for thequality and completion 
of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules,regulations, or orders. The Uti
lity may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-partycontractor actions.
Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery underall circumstances o
r against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s insurance coverage may not b
e sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather eventsand events resulting from these conditions (inc
luding wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.As a result of the potentia
l application to IOUs of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, past losses recorded by insurancecompanies, past wildfires 
and the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurancecoverage in the future at a
 reasonable cost, or at all.The Utility has experienc
ed increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility’s ordinaryoperations. PG&E Corporation, the Util
ity or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions or increased insurance costs in futureyears. No assurance can be given 
that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage, including losses arising from litigation. Uninsuredlosses and increases in the 
cost of insurance may not be recoverable through rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered through rates, andincreased insurance cos
ts that are not recoverable, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant 
changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy.The electric power indust
ry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice and state climate policysupporting a decarbonized e
conomy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of distributed energy resources,such as on-site solar gener
ation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernizationof the electric dis
tribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid’s capacity, and interconnect distributed energyresources. In order to enab
le the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energyefficiency programs, 
energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). If the Utility is unable toeffectively adapt to these cha
nges, its business model and its ability to execute on its strategy could be materially impacted.44

Various jurisdictions within California have enacted prohibitions or restrictions on use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will reducethe use of natural gas. Reducing n
atural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result,could lead to certain g
as assets no longer being “used and useful,” potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under CPUCprecedent, when an asset no longe
r meets the standard of “used and useful,” the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in associated raterecovery). However, while natur
al gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California havebeen increasing, among othe
r things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover through rates its investmentsinto the natural gas syste
m while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
These industry changes, costs assoc
iated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’sinability to successful
ly adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
The Utility’s operational networks and information t
echnology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event, orphysical attack.
The Utility’s electr
icity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communicationtechnologies, which can be dam
aged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks.Private and public entit
ies, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense,Homeland Security and Energy, and th
e White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, andfrequency. The Utility’s ope
rational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with newtechnologies and control syst
ems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees,significantly disrupt ope
rations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in themost safe and effici
ent manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.The Utility also relies on 
complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,including the Utility’s f
inancial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and theirdependents, contractors, and o
ther individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and toprovide other services to 
the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (includingcustomer energy usage a
nd personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid modernization andcustomer choice. These th
ird-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, or experiencesecurity incidents or in
adequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems could impact the Utility’s ability totrack or collect revenues an
d to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.The Utility and its third-p
arty vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to theUtility’s information 
technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations. Noneof these breaches or at
tempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that theUtility will be able to pr
event unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Suchevents could subject the Uti
lity to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacylaws, investigations, and regul
atory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sreputation, any of which could hav
e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility maintains cyb
er liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no assurance that adequate insurance willcontinue to be availabl
e at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered byinsurance or recoverab
le through rates.45

The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able tofully recover its costs i
f regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire.The operation of the 
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such asrisks relating to opera
tion of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release ofradioactive materials caused by
 a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered byinsurance or exceed the 
amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of eachnuclear incident occu
rring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern aboutthe safety of nuclear g
eneration and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging theactions of the NRC and urging government
al entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail,regulatory proceedings m
ay take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changesin legislation, regula
tions, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease beforetheir respective l
icenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecoveredinvestment and such charge 
could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incurcosts in connection with (i) 
an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and developmentprogram, to facilit
ate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. There can be noassurance that the Util
ity will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs.The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business above. If the Utility wer
e unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows could be materi
ally affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner andvoluntarily cease oper
ations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, ordecisions. The Utility may in
cur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility
’s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.16 billion.The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, atthe end of their useful l
ives. See “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. The Utility’s costs todecommission its nuclea
r facilities through nuclear decommissioning are subject to reasonableness review by the CPUC. The Utility will be responsible for anycosts that the CPUC determines were no
t reasonably incurred. If the Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nucleardecommissioning trusts, exc
eed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially affected.

Risks Related to Environmental FactorsSevere weather conditions, extended drought, and climat
e change could materially affect PG&E Corporation and the Utility.Extreme weather, drought and sh
ifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with many of the other risks facing PG&E Corporation and theUtility, particular
ly wildfire management in California. The Utility’s service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as aconsequence, is subject to high
er risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as droughtconditions and extreme he
at followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both thelikelihood and severity of 
extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires, including during the 2021 wildfire season, has increased in theUtility’s service ar
ea as a result of an ongoing extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to risingtemperatures and re
cord rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. As of December 31, 2021, more than 86% ofCalifornia is experien
cing severe to extreme drought. Moderate or severe drought conditions occur and can persist in virtually all of the Utility’s service territory.More than half of the Util
ity’s service area is in an HFTD. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestrymanagement practi
ces. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows
 that approximately half of the Utility’s service territory is facing “elevated” or “extreme” fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles ofthe Utility’s nearly 81,000 dis
tribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in suchHFTDs, significantly more in tota
l than other California IOUs.Severe weather events and oth
er natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, extreme heat events (including recent extreme heatevents during the 2021 wildfire s
eason), drought, earthquakes, lightning, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, wind eventsor other weather-rel
ated conditions, climate change, or natural disasters, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage,injuries and loss of life, s
ignificant decreases in revenues and earnings, and significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also couldlead to significant c
laims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encountersdifficulties in res
toring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’s practices or the failure of electricand other equipment of the Ut
ility.Further, the Utility has been s
tudying the potential effects of climate change (increased severity and frequency of storm events, sea level rise, land subsidence,change in temperatur
e extremes, changes in precipitation patterns and drought, and wildfire) on its assets, operations, and services, and the Utility is developingadaptation plans to set fo
rth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Consequences of these climate-driven eventsmay vary widely and could includ
e increased stress on the energy supply network due to new patterns of demand, reduced hydroelectric output, physical damage tothe Utility’s infrast
ructure, higher operational costs, and an increase in the number and duration of customer outages and safety consequences for both employeesand customers. As a result, the Ut
ility’s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation.If the Utility increases its
 reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may becomemore costly for the Util
ity to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, windstorms, and flooding caused by rising sealevels and extreme sto
rms could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incursubstantial costs to re
pair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates thatthe increased costs would be r
ecovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. See “Rising ratesfor the Utility’s custom
ers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE” above.Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or increased exp
enses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.47

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws, and such laws could change.The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and othercosts associated with compl
iance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required topay for environmental r
emediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although theUtility has recorded li
abilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,remediation alternatives, the ap
plicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. For more information, see Note 15 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
tal or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanctions.
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking mechanisms in the future, or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover through rates.Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through ratesor insurance. See “Environmen
tal Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility’s costs toremediate groundwater 
contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs, andthe extent to which actua
l remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Risks Related to Other Enforcement Matt
ers, Investigations, and Regulatory ProceedingsPG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Pro
cess.The EOEP is a six-step process with potent
ially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific “triggering events” identified for each ofthe six steps. If the Utili
ty is placed into the EOEP, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC.Higher steps of the process (st
eps 3 through 6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-party monitor,appointment of a chief 
restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility’s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., itslicense to operate as 
a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The EOEP states that theUtility should presumptively 
move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process uponoccurrence of a speci
fied triggering event.On April 15, 2021, the CPUC placed the Utility into st
ep 1 of the EOEP for failing to sufficiently prioritize clearing vegetation on its highest risk power lines aspart of the 2020 WMP work. There can be no 
assurance regarding if or when the Utility will exit the EOEP, or whether the CPUC will initiate another step 1proceeding or whether the CPUC will seek to 
move the Utility into a higher step of the process. See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be materiall
y affected by legislative and regulatory developments.The Utility is subject to ex
tensive regulations. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially affected if the Wildfire Fu
nd does not effectively mitigate the financial risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where theUtility’s facilit
ies are a substantial cause. See “The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damagesarising from catast
rophic wildfires.” above.48

In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance byJanuary 1, 2019. The State of Californ
ia announced enacted regulations in August 2020 and March 2021 which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA.The CCPA requires companies that proc
ess information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharingpractices, allows consume
rs to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides forfinancial penalti
es in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted toapprove Proposition 24, a ballot m
easure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which amended and expanded the CCPA. The State ofCalifornia enacted th
e CPRA in November 2020, with most provisions operative as of January 1, 2023 and applicable to personal information collected beginningJanuary 1, 2022. Failure to comply with 
the CCPA and the CPRA could result in the imposition of material fines imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.Also, SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018) 
increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come fromrenewables by 203
0; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-freeresources by 2045. Failure to comp
ly with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that could be material.The Utility is subject to ext
ensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations.The Utility is subject to ex
tensive regulations, including federal, state, and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcementproceedings in connection with 
compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection withthe Safety Culture OII (as de
fined in “Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Safety Culture” under “Enforcement andLitigation Matters” 
in Item 7. MD&A) and other matters that the CPUC’s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issueit deems appropriate. 
In addition, OEIS has authority to approve and oversee compliance with the WMP.The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state, or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and RA requirements;customer billing; customer 
service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspectionpractices; compli
ance with CPUC GOs or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; whether the Utility is able to achieve the targets in its WMPs; federalelectric reli
ability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authorityunder the gas and electr
ic safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. See “Risks Related to Wildfires,”above. The Utility is unable to p
redict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount ofany costs and expenses associat
ed with such investigations.If these investigations 
result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantialand, in the event of a judgmen
t against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations,or future enforcement actions
, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; forexample, by enabling 
parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations.49

The Utility’s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility’s actual costs could exceed its authorized orforecasted costs due to various factors, 
including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively.The Utility’s financia
l results depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity, and to recover costs from itscustomers, through the rat
es it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and the FERC. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility or if the amount ofactual costs incurred d
iffers from the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates. The outcome of the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by manyfactors, including the l
evel of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory,or legislative environ
ments; and the opinions of the Utility’s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability toprovide safe, reliabl
e, and affordable electric and gas services. If the CPUC does not authorize sufficient funding for investments in the Utility’s infrastructure, itmay negatively impac
t the Utility's ability to modernize the grid and make it resilient to risks related to climate change, including wildfires.In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows couldbe materially affected if the Utility’
s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility’s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate ofreturn can be affec
ted by many factors, including the time delay between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered through rates. The CPUC orthe FERC may not allow the Utility to r
ecover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, the Utilitymay be required to incur 
expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, the Utility has incurred, and continuesto incur, costs to strengthen 
its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable through rates. Also, the CPUCmay deny recovery of uninsured wi
ldfire- related costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility was not prudent.The Utility may incur addi
tional costs or reduced revenue for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires,storms, earthquakes, acc
idents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributedgeneration, lower custome
r demand due to adverse economic conditions, the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers like CCAs or DA providers,whether the CAISO wholesale electr
icity market continues to function effectively, returning customers, or compliance with new state laws or policies. See“Competition in the Electricit
y Industry” in Item 1.Risks Related to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Environment and Financial Condition
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s substantial indebtedness ma
y adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
a substantial amount of indebtedness, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&E Corporation and theUtility. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation h
ad approximately $4.71 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of PG&ECorporation’s $1.0 billion aggreg
ate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030,and borrowings under the $2.75 billion se
cured term loan agreement entered into in June 2020), and the Utility had approximately $38.3 billion of outstandingindebtedness (such indebtedness 
including outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, borrowings under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under theUtility Term Loan Credit Agre
ement). In addition, PG&E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving CreditAgreement, and the Utility h
ad $1.4 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had outstandingpreferred stock with an agg
regate liquidation preference of $252 million.Since PG&E Corporation and the Utility h
ave a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt.Furthermore, since a signi
ficant percentage of the Utility’s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debtor credit support and reduc
es its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other importantconsequences for PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility, including:•
limiting their ability or increasing the costs to refinance their indebtedness;•
limiting their ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of their businessstrategy or other purposes;
50

•limiting their ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of their business;•
increasing their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given their substantialindebtedness that bears in
terest at variable rates, as well as to catastrophic events; and•
limiting their ability to capitalize on business opportunities.Under the terms of the agr
eements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additionalindebtedness, some of which could be s
ecured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high levelof indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinancesuch indebtedness at or prior 
to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all. As a capital-intensive company, the Utility relies on access tothe capital marke
ts. If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected. The Utility’s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and makescheduled payments of princ
ipal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including the Utility’s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable creditratings, financial pe
rformance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. The Utility’s inability to service its substantial debt or access the financialmarkets on reasonable t
erms could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
The documents that govern PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indebt
edness limit their flexibility in operating their business.PG&E Corporatio
n’s and the Utility’s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain variouscovenants restricting, 
among other things, their ability to:•
incur or assume indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness;•
incur or assume liens;•
sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its property or business;•
merge or consolidate with other companies;•
enter into any sale leaseback transactions; and•
enter into swap agreements.The restrictions conta
ined in these material financing agreements could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to operate their business and may limittheir ability to re
act to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, sell assets,restructure their o
rganization or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with these covenants andrestrictions may be a
ffected by events beyond their control, including prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions.Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order.
Following entry of the Confirmat
ion Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number ofsuch appeals have been dismiss
ed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal wouldnot have a material 
adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.51

PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&ECorporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with resp
ect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims.On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation 
issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding commonstock on such date. As further desc
ribed in “Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims” in Note 14 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8, PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescissionor Damage Claims. If such issuan
ce is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&ECorporation common stock such tha
t it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&E Corporation on the Emergence Date,assuming that such issuance of sh
ares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date. Any such issuances willresult in dilution to anyone who holds sh
ares of PG&E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&E Corporationshares to decline.
Additionally, PG&E Corporation may be r
equired to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in “Satisfactionof HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordin
ated Debt Claims” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Suchpayment may have a mat
erial adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockhold
ers could depress the market value of PG&E Corporation’s common stock, thereby devaluing the marketprice.
Certain stockholders, includ
ing the Fire Victim Trust, received a large number of shares in the Chapter 11 Cases and may continue to hold shares of PG&ECorporation. PG&E Corporation can make no p
rediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on theprevailing market pr
ice of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or theperception that such sal
es could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&E Corporation tosell equity securities or e
quity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate.PG&E Corporation may also sell addi
tional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertibleinto shares of PG&E Corporation common s
tock. The issuance of any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in future financings, acquisitions uponconversion or exercise of 
convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&E Corporation's outstandingcommon stock. If PG&E Corporation issues 
any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of allcurrent shareholders. PG&E Corpora
tion cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock or securities convertible intoshares of PG&E Corporation common stock o
r, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of PG&E Corporation'scommon stock.
PG&E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restric
tions intended to preserve PG&E Corporation’s ability to use its net operatingloss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
PG&E Corporation has incurred and may 
also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, theamount and availability of
 which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certainrestrictions on the tr
ansferability and ownership of PG&E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the “capital stock”) and other interestsdesignated as “stock” of PG&E Corpora
tion by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the “Equity Securities,” andsuch restrictions on trans
ferability and ownership, the “Ownership Restrictions”) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result inlimitations on PG&E Corporation’s 
ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal incometax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&E Corporat
ion capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid.52

Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiringor accumulating 4.75% or mo
re of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) alreadyowning, directly or indirec
tly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities. For more information, see“Because PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as definedin PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles o
f Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from thenumber of shares reported 
as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act” below. Any transferee receiving Equity Securities thatwould result in a violation of 
the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders,including, without limita
tion, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the EquitySecurities causing the vio
lation.The Ownership Restrictions rema
in in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successorprovision) of the Interna
l Revenue Code, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code no longer applicable toPG&E Corporation, (ii) the beginning o
f a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to netoperating losses or other t
ax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code as o
f such date in the event of an “ownership change” of PG&E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal RevenueCode and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502
-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or “net unrealized built-in loss”(within the meaning of Sect
ion 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&E Corporation, and (iv) the dateselected by the Board of Dire
ctors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&E Corporation’s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removedor released. The Ownership Restri
ctions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis.Because PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected 
to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, asdefined in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will b
e determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differmaterially from the number of shares repor
ted as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act.The Plan contemplated tha
t the Fire Victim Trust would be treated as a “qualified settlement fund” for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, subject to PG&ECorporation’s ability to e
lect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes instead. On July 8, 2021, PG&ECorporation, the Utility, ShareCo, and 
the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which PG&E Corporationand the Utility made a 
grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust.As a result of the grantor t
rust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turnattributed to PG&E Corporation fo
r income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust are effectively excluded from the total numberof outstanding equity securi
ties when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the OwnershipRestrictions. See “Tax Matt
ers” in Item 7. MD&A for an example of these calculations. PG&E Corporation does not control the number of shares held by the FireVictim Trust and is not able 
to determine in advance the number of shares the Fire Victim Trust will hold. PG&E Corporation intends to periodically makeavailable to investors 
information about the number of shares of common stock held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo as of a specified date forpurposes of the Ownership Restrictions, 
including in its Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports filed with the SEC.PG&E Corporation intends to enforce 
the Ownership Restrictions as described in the foregoing paragraph (calculated as excluding any shares owned by the FireVictim Trust, the Utility, 
and ShareCo from the number of outstanding equity securities). All current and prospective shareholders are advised to consider theforegoing in determining 
their ownership and acquisition of PG&E Corporation common stock.53

PG&E Corporation may not be able to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income.As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation had net ope
rating loss carryforwards for PG&E Corporation’s consolidated group for U.S. federal and Californiaincome tax purposes of approxi
mately $21.1 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, and PG&E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur in connectionwith the Plan significant ne
t operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating losscarryforwards and cert
ain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which also applies forCalifornia state inco
me tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” such net operating loss carryforwards and othertax attributes may be sub
ject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally fivepercent shareholders, app
lying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownershipduring the testing peri
od (generally three years).As of the date of this report, 
it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards andother tax attributes 
are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, whether PG&E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownershipchange as a result of the 
transactions in PG&E Corporation’s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&E Corporation’scontrol and the applica
tion of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assertthat PG&E Corporation has undergone or wil
l undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did not cause an ownershipchange, they may increas
e the likelihood that PG&E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the IRS successfully asserts that PG&ECorporation did undergo, or PG&E Corporation oth
erwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other taxattributes under Section 382 o
f the Internal Revenue Code could be material to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
In particular, lim
itations imposed on PG&E Corporation’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal andCalifornia income tax
es to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or othertax attributes to expi
re unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. In addition, PG&ECorporation’s ability to ut
ilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to a successful rate-neutral securitization transaction and to PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s commitment to ma
ke certain operating and capital expenditures. Failure to consummate a securitization transaction or obtain alternative sources ofcapital could have a m
aterial adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the value of PG&E Corporation common stock.PG&E Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on shares of its 
common stock is subject to restrictions.Pursuant to the Confirmation Orde
r, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP CoreEarnings following the Emergen
ce Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items.Subject to the foregoing res
trictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, PG&E Corporation
’s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that theBoard of Directors may deem 
relevant.54

PG&E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to meetits obligations.
PG&E Corporation conducts its operat
ions primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s consolidated assets are held bythe Utility. Accordingly, PG&E Corporat
ion’s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largelydependent upon the earnings and c
ash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&E Corporation in the formof dividends or loans or advances 
and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances,distributions, and transfe
rs of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount offunds available for paym
ent of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility must use itsresources to satisfy its own obl
igations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stockdividends, and to meet its obl
igations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation. Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation,the Utility cannot pay com
mon stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock have been paid. As of January 31, 2022,there were $59.1 million of su
ch cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. In addition, the CPUC has imposed various conditions thatgovern the relationship be
tween PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of Directors to give first priority to thecapital requirem
ents of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent andefficient manner. On Febru
ary 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’spreferred stock as of Janu
ary 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, payable on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 and declared a dividend on theUtility’s preferred s
tock totaling $3.5 million that will be accrued during the three-month period ending April 30, 2022, payable on May 15, 2022, to holders ofrecord on April 29, 2022. It is uncer
tain when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on their common stock. Thedeterioration of inco
me from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility’s ability to pay dividends or other distributionsto PG&E Corporation, which could, in turn, ma
terially and adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s ability to meet its obligations.California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the a
mended and restated bylaws of PG&E Corporation (the “Amended Bylaws”) mayprevent efforts by shareholders to change the dir
ection or management of PG&E Corporation.The Amended Articles and the Amend
ed Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&E Corporation more difficult without the approval of theBoard of Directors, including th
e following:•
until 2024, the Board of Directors will be divided into two equal classes, with members of each class elected in different years for different terms;•
only holders of shares who are entitled to cast ten percent or more of the votes can request a special meeting of the shareholders, and any such requestmust satisfy the requir
ements specified in the Amended Bylaws; action by shareholders may otherwise only be taken at an annual or special meeting dulycalled by or at the dir
ection of a majority of the Board of Directors, or action by written consent signed by shareholders owning at least the number ofvotes necessary to authori
ze the action at a meeting where all shares entitled to vote were present;•
advance notice for all shareholder proposals is required; and•
any person acquiring PG&E Corporation Equity Securities will be restricted from owning 4.75% or more of such Equity Securities (as determined forfederal income tax pu
rposes (see “Tax Matters” in Item 7. MD&A)), subject to certain exceptions as may be determined by the Board of Directors ofPG&E Corporation.
These and other provisions in the Am
ended Articles, the Amended Bylaws, and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirersto obtain control of the Board o
f Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding merger,tender offer, or proxy cont
est involving PG&E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&E Corporation commonstock and limit opportunit
ies for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction.55

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantlyaffected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continueto be significantly af
fected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (and its variants), but the extent of such impact is uncertain.PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to evaluate the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on their business and financial results. The consequences of acontinued and prolonged outbreak 
and resulting governmental and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a negative impact on the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the resulting economic conditions, and resulting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility’s serviceterritory, have and will 
continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s customers. These circumstances have impacted and will continue to impactthe Utility for a period o
f time that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict. For example, the economic downturn has resulted in a reduction incustomer receipts and 
collection delays throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.The Utility’s accounts re
ceivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $1.1 billion, or $832 million higher as comparedto the balances as of Dece
mber 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utilityexpects to continue exper
iencing an impact on monthly cash collections for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist.On January 1, 2021, electric ra
tes were reset using sales that were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic impacts and significant ongoing shortfalls are not currentlyexpected in 2021. PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility are currently unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections orchanges in energy demand on ea
rnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and theresulting economic downturn. Although 
the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associated with customerprotection measures, th
e timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimate cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting econo
mic downturn have resulted and will continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability(including a reduction in 
contract labor resources) and deployment. Increased governmental regulation of the COVID-19 pandemic protections, includingvaccination mandates o
r testing requirement for workers, could result in employee attrition, workforce disruptions and increased supplier and contractor costs.Although the Utility continues to p
rioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility’s operating and capital expenditureplans, which could lead to proje
ct delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility’s operationsmay also impact operations.
The Utility has experie
nced shortages in certain materials, longer lead times and delivery delays as a result of domestic and international raw material and laborshortages. If these disrupt
ions to the supply chain persist or worsen, the Utility may be delayed or prevented from completing planned maintenance and capitalprojects work.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct additional financial impacts in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential longer-term impacts of theCOVID-19 pandemic on PG&E Corporation or the Utili
ty include the potential for higher credit spreads, borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s analysis of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and subject to change. PG&E Corporation and the Utilityare unable to predict 
the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and any variant strainsof the COVID-19 virus, the effectiv
eness and intensity of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic (including availability and effectiveness of vaccines), andthe effects of the COVID-19 situa
tion on the business, financial condition and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and on the business andgeneral economic condi
tions in the State of California and the United States of America.56

Rising rates for the Utility’s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE.The rates paid by the Utili
ty’s customers are impacted by the Utility’s costs, commodity prices, and broader energy trends. The Utility’s capital investment plan,increasing procuremen
t of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other publicpolicy requirements, co
llectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. In particular, the Utility will need to make substantial, sustained investmentsto its infrastructur
e to adapt to climate change. For more information on factors that could cause the Utility’s costs to increase, see “The Utility’s ratemaking andcost recovery proceedings 
may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility’s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors,including if the Utility 
is not able to manage its costs effectively” above. If customer rates increase, the CPUC may face greater pressure to approve lesser amountsin the Utility’s rate
making or cost recovery proceedings.The Utility generally r
ecovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as “pass-through” costs. Increases in the Utility’s commodity costsdirectly impact customer bills.
Increasing levels of self-ge
neration of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generatingcustomers to receive b
ill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, shifts costs to other customers. Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay theirproportionate share of th
e cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, while still receivingelectricity from the system w
hen their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. These unpaid costs are subsidized by customers not participatingin NEM. Accordingly, as more elec
tric customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turnencourages more self-g
eneration, further increasing rate pressure on existing non-NEM customers.Other long-term trends cou
ld also increase costs for gas customers. Natural gas providers are subject to compliance with CARB’s cap-and-trade program, andnatural gas end-use custom
ers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the program through 2030 (when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills).CARB may also require aggressive ene
rgy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use. Increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electricsector could reduce electric ge
neration gas load. Additionally, customers replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances will lead to further reduced gasdemand. The combination of r
educed load and increased costs to maintain the gas system could result in higher natural gas customer bills. In addition, some localcity governments have passed o
rdinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction and, if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand forthe provision of natural gas. 
If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility’s gas system maintenance costs, many of which cannot be reduced in theshort term even if gas quan
tities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers. Finally, a potential mandate to purchase renewable natural gas for core customerscould lead to cost reco
very risk if utilities are competing with the transportation sector without receiving the same incentives.A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further reduce energy demand. Reduced energy demand or significantlyslowed growth in demand due to custome
r migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels ofdistributed generation 
and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could increase the energy rates for other customers.If rates were to rise 
too rapidly, customer usage could decline. This decline would decrease the volume of sales, among which the Utility’s fixed costs areallocated, and increase rates.
To relieve some of this upward 
rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or increase the period over which the Utility isallowed to recover amounts, whi
ch could impact the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs. The Utility’s level of authorized capital investment coulddecline as well, leading 
to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows could be 
materially affected.57

General Risk FactorsThe Utility may be unable to attrac
t and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or prolonged labor disruptions may occur.The Utility’s workforce is ag
ing, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts torecruit and train new f
ield service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’semployees are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renewthe terms of these agr
eements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-representedUtility employees could jo
in one of these unions in the future.PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore thereputational harm gen
erated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences couldmaterially aff
ect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information about labordisruptions related to th
e COVID-19 pandemic, see “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows havebeen and could continue to be sign
ificantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic” above.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Utility owns or has obtained the 
right to occupy or use real property comprising the Utility’s electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electricgeneration facilities, natural ga
s gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1.Business, under “Electric Uti
lity Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property primarily through various leases,easements, rights-of-way, p
ermits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 9 million square feet of realproperty, including 7 mill
ion square feet owned by the Utility. On September 17, 2021, the sale of the SFGO closed and the Utility entered into a leasebackagreement with the new SFGO owner (the “Le
aseback Agreement”) to lease back certain space within the SFGO to allow for additional time to relocate criticalfacilities to othe
r Utility sites. The Leaseback Agreement commenced on September 17, 2021 and continues through various dates for the various leased spaces,with December 31, 2023 being the la
test lease expiration date. On October 23, 2020, the Utility entered into an office lease agreement with BA2 300 Lakeside LLCfor approximately 910,000 ren
table square feet of space within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters. The term ofthe lease will begin on or abou
t April 8, 2022 and the lease grants the Utility an option to purchase the legal parcel that contains the Lakeside Building. For moreinformation, see Note 15 of th
e Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.PG&E Corporation also leases approxi
mately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease will expire and besurrendered at the end of Feb
ruary 2022.The Utility currently owns approx
imately 148,000 acres of land, including approximately 121,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002, the Utility agreed toimplement its Land Conserva
tion Commitment (“LCC”) to permanently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservationeasements or equivalen
t protections, as well as to make approximately 40,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations. Thesix “beneficial publi
c values” being preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the generalpublic; sustainable for
estry; agricultural uses; and historic values. The Utility’s goal is to implement all the LCC transactions by the end of 2023, subject tosecuring all required 
regulatory approvals.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ITEM 7. MANAGE
MENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW
This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities. Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included inItem 8.
Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share
PG&E Corporation’s net loss attribu
table to common shareholders was $102 million in 2021, compared to $1.3 billion in 2020. In the year ended December 31,2021, PG&E Corporation recorded a $1.3 bill
ion charge, net of tax as a result of the grantor trust election, with no similar amount in 2020. This amount is partiallyoffset by increases in bas
e revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC and previously deferred costs associated with various regulatory proceedings in the year endedDecember 31, 2021. In the year end
ed December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation recognized $1.1 billion of expense related to the Backstop Commitment PremiumShares and $452 million of expense 
related to the Additional Backstop Premium Shares, with no similar amounts in 2021.63

Key Factors Affecting Financial ResultsPG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the followingfactors:
•
The Uncertainties in Connection with Any Future Wildfires, Wildfire Insurance, and AB 1054. While PG&E Corporation and the Util ity cannot predict theoccurrence, timing or 
extent of damages in connection with future wildfires, factors such as environmental conditions (including weather and vegetationconditions) and the efficac
y of wildfire risk mitigation initiatives are expected to influence the frequency and severity of future wildfires. To the extentthat future wildfires o
ccur in the Utility’s service territory, the Utility may incur costs associated with the investigations of the causes and origins of suchfires, even if it is subsequ
ently determined that such fires were not caused by the Utility’s facilities. The financial impact of future wildfires could bemitigated through insuran
ce, the Wildfire Fund or other forms of cost recovery. However, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient wildfireinsurance coverage at 
a reasonable cost, or at all, and any such coverage may include limitations that could result in substantial uninsured lossesdepending on the amount and type of d
amages resulting from covered events, including coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layers. TheUtility will not be able to ob
tain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any Wildfire Fund coverage year (“Coverage Year”)that do not exceed the gre
ater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. In addition, the policyreforms contemplat
ed by AB 1054 are likely to affect the financial impact of future wildfires on PG&E Corporation and the Utility should any suchwildfires occur. The Wil
dfire Fund is available to the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires and serves as an alternative totraditional insuranc
e products, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB1054 and that the Wildfir
e Fund has sufficient remaining funds. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8.
However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability to demonstrateto the CPUC that wildfire-rela
ted costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable and therefore not subject to reimbursement, and whether thebenefits of particip
ating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh its substantial costs. Finally, even if the Utility satisfies the ongoing eligibility and otherrequirements set for
th in AB 1054, for eligible claims against the Utility arising from wildfires that occurred between July 12, 2019 and the Utility’semergence from Chapte
r 11 on July 1, 2020, the availability of the Wildfire Fund to pay such claims would be capped at 40% of the allowed amount ofsuch claims. See “Wildf
ire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.•
The Costs, Effectiveness, and Execution of the Utility’s Wildfire Mitigation Initiatives. In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur and theimpact of PSPS events.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility incu
rred substantial expenditures in 2020 and 2021 in connection with the 2020-2022 WMP. For more information, seeNote 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements in Item 8. The Utility expects that its wildfire mitigation initiatives will continue to involvesubstantial and ongoing expenditu
res. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures and potential other costs through rates isuncertain.
The Utility has implemen
ted operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including the EPSS, PSPS, vegetation management, assetinspection, and system harden
ing programs. These programs, particularly the PSPS and EPSS programs, have been the subject of significant scrutiny andcriticism by various st
akeholders, including the California governor, the CPUC and the court that oversaw the Utility’s probation. The PSPS and EPSSprograms have had an adverse 
impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers, and future PSPSevents may increase th
ese negative perceptions. See “OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events” in “Regulatory Matters” below.The Utility is subject to a nu
mber of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections ofelectric assets and ongo
ing reporting related to this work. Although the Utility believes that it has complied substantially with these requirements, it isundertaking a review and has id
entified instances of noncompliance. The Utility intends to update the CPUC and OEIS as its review progresses. TheUtility could face fines,
 penalties, enforcement action, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for the late inspections or other noncompliancerelated to wildfire 
mitigation efforts. See “Self-Reports to the CPUC” in “Regulatory Matters” below.64

While PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking aggressive wildfire mitigation actions, if additional requirements are imposed that gobeyond current expectat
ions, such requirements could have a substantial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows. The success of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts depends on many factors, including on whether the Utility isable to retain or cont
ract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. See “Order Instituting Investigation into the 2017 NorthernCalifornia Wildfir
es and the 2018 Camp Fire” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.•
The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking Proceedings. The Utility’s financia l results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its FERC TO18 ratecase and the resulting i
mpact on the TO19 and TO20 rate cases, 2023 GRC, WMCE applications, and its ability to timely recover costs not currently inrates, including costs al
ready incurred and future costs tracked in its CEMA, WEMA, WMPMA, FRMMA, CPPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA. Theoutcome of regulatory pr
oceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the regulatory andpolitical environmen
ts, and other factors. See Notes 4 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters”below.
•
The Impact of Wildfires. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liabilities for the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, or the 2021 Dixie fire, aresignificant and may be ex
cluded from any potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies, the WEMA, FERC TO rates, or the WildfireFund under AB 1054. Recorded liabilities in 
connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2021 Dixie fire have already exceeded potential amountsrecoverable under applicable i
nsurance policies. Liabilities in excess of recoverable amounts for these wildfires could have a material impact on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had recorded an aggregate liability of $800 million, $375 million, and $1.15 billion forclaims in connection with 
the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, and the 2021 Dixie fire, respectively, and in each case before available insurance andother probable cost recov
eries in the case of the 2021 Dixie fire. These liability amounts correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimableprobable losses, but do not include 
all categories of potential damages and losses. Claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire that were not satisfied in full asof the Emergence Date wer
e not discharged in connection with emerging from Chapter 11.On April 6, 2021, the Sonoma County District Attorney
’s Office charged the Utility with five felonies and 28 misdemeanors in connection with the 2019Kincade fire, and on January 28, 2022, th
e Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office filed the Kincade Amended Complaint, which replaced two felonieswith five different f
elonies and dropped six misdemeanor counts. On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office charged theUtility with 11 felonies and 20 m
isdemeanors in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and three other fires. If the Utility were to be convicted of certaincharges in the Kincade Amended Comp
laint or the Zogg Complaint, the Utility could be subject to material fines, penalties, and restitution, as well asnon-monetary remedies su
ch as oversight requirements, and accordingly the Utility currently believes that, depending on which charges it were to beconvicted of, its total 
losses associated with the 2019 Kincade fire or the 2020 Zogg fire would materially exceed the $800 million or $375 million,respectively, of aggreg
ate liability that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded.If the eligible claims for liabilities
 arising from wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in any Coverage Year, the Utility may be eligible to make a claim tothe Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such ex
cess amount, except that recoveries for the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to the 40% limitation on theallowed amount of claims 
arising before emergence from bankruptcy, and recoveries for each of these fires would also be subject to the other limitationsand requirements under AB 1054. As of Decemb
er 31, 2021, the Utility had recorded insurance receivables of $430 million for the 2019 Kincade fire,$337 million for the 2020 Zogg fir
e, and $563 million for the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility had recorded regulatory recovery and Wildfire Fund receivablesof $448 million and $150 million, 
respectively, for the 2021 Dixie fire. However, there can be no assurance that such amounts will ultimately berecovered, and the Utili
ty does not expect that any of its liability insurance would cover restitution payments ordered by the courts presiding over thecriminal proceedings. Se
e “2019 Kincade Fire,” “2020 Zogg Fire,” and “2021 Dixie Fire” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 fo
r more information.65

•The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility’s financia l results may continue tobe impacted by the outcom
e of other current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including those described above as well as theoutcome of the Safety Cultur
e OII, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s WMP and safety and other self-reports. See Note 15 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8. In addition, the Utility’s business profile and financial results could be impacted by the outcomeof recent calls for municipalizatio
n of part or all of the Utility’s businesses, offers by municipalities and other public entities to acquire the electric assetsof the Utility within thei
r respective jurisdictions and calls for state intervention, including the possibility of a state takeover of the Utility. PG&ECorporation and the Utility c
annot predict the nature, occurrence, timing or extent of any such scenario, and there can be no assurance that any suchscenario would not involve signif
icant ownership or management changes to PG&E Corporation or the Utility, including by the state of California.Further, certain part
ies filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order, including provisions related to the injunction contained in the Planthat channels certain pre-petitio
n fire-related claims to trusts to be satisfied from the trusts’ assets. There can be no assurance that any such appeal will notbe successful and, if success
ful, that any such appeal would not have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.•
The Uncertainties in Connection with the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. On April 15, 2021, the CPUC placed the Utility in step 1 o f theEOEP. As a result, the Utility is subjec
t to additional reporting requirements, monitoring, and oversight by the CPUC. See “Enhanced Oversight andEnforcement Process” in “En
forcement and Litigation Matters” below.•
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows havebeen and could continue to be sign
ificantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The principal areas of near-term impact includeliquidity, financial 
results and business operations, stemming primarily from the ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, the moratorium onservice disconnections, and 
an observed reduction in non-residential electrical load. The Utility continues to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19pandemic; however, the Util
ity expects a significant impact on monthly cash collections as long as current circumstances persist. PG&E Corporation andthe Utility expect addi
tional financial impacts in the future as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Other impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e included operational disruptions, workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including a reduction in contractlabor resources) and deploy
ment, delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility’s operations, higher credit spreads and borrowingcosts and could potentially 
also include a reduction in revenue due to the cost of capital adjustment mechanism and incremental financing needs. For moreinformation on the impa
ct of COVID-19 pandemic on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, see “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.” inItem 1A Risk Factors and “COVID-19” in Liquidity 
and Financial Resources below.For more information about 
the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, or that could cause futu
re results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  In addition, this annual report contains forward-lookingstatements that ar
e necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on currentestimates, expecta
tions, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge of facts as of the date of thisreport.  See “Forward-Looking State
ments” above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and theUtility are unable to pr
edict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether inresponse to new information, fu
ture events, or otherwise.Tax Matters
PG&E Corporation had a U.S. federal net ope
rating loss carryforward of approximately $21.1 billion and California net operating loss carryforward of$18.9 billion at the end of 2021.
66

Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders(generally five per
cent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentageownership during the testing per
iod (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the AmendedArticles) that incr
ease a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to theRestriction Release Date 
(as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation (the “Ownership Restrictions”).As discussed below under “Update on Ownership Restri
ctions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles,” due to the election to treat the Fire Victim Trust as agrantor trust for incom
e tax purposes, the calculation of Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) will effectively be based on a reducednumber of shares outstanding, na
mely the total number of outstanding equity securities less the number of equity securities held by the Fire Victim Trust, theUtility and ShareCo. As of the date of 
this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, itsnet operating loss carry
forwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and th
e Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant towhich PG&E Corporation and the Utility m
ade a grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust.As a result of the benefits o
f a grantor trust election, the Utility’s tax deductions occur when the Fire Victim Trust pays the fire victims, rather than when the Utilitytransferred cash and oth
er property (including PG&E Corporation common stock) to the Fire Victim Trust. Therefore, $5.4 billion of cash and $4.54 billion ofPG&E Corporation common stock, in the agg
regate $10.0 billion, that were transferred to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020, will not be deductible for tax purposes bythe Utility until the Fir
e Victim Trust pays the fire victims.Furthermore, the activ
ities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for tax purposes. PG&E Corporation’s net operating loss has decreased byapproximately $10.0 billion whi
ch will be offset by payments made by the Fire Victim Trust to the fire victims (which totaled approximately $1.67 billion in 2021)and the net activiti
es of the Fire Victim Trust. Additionally, there was a $1.3 billion charge, net of tax, decreasing net DTAs for the payment made to the FireVictim Trust in PG&E Corporation com
mon stock on its Consolidated Financial Statements for activity through December 31, 2020. PG&E Corporation willrecognize income tax b
enefits and the corresponding DTA as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, and the amounts of suchbenefits and assets will be 
impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were transferred to theFire Victim Trust. As of Decembe
r 31, 2021, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had not sold any shares of PG&E Corporationcommon stock, resulting in no t
ax impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. OnJanuary 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trus
t initiated an exchange of 40,000,000 Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by theShare Exchange and Tax Matters Agr
eement and announced that it had entered into a transaction for the sale of these shares.Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
As a result of the grantor t
rust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn,attributed to PG&E Corporation fo
r income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust, alongwith any shares owned by the Utility di
rectly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’sPercentage Stock Ownership (as def
ined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned byShareCo are also effect
ively excluded because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had2,463,891,104 shares outstanding as of February 4, 2022, on
ly 1,548,403,924 shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of sharesheld by the Fire Victim Trust, 
the Utility and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based onthe total number of outst
anding equity securities and assuming the Fire Victim Trust has not sold any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, a person’seffective Percent
age Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of February 4, 2022 was 2.98% of outstanding shares. As of December31, 2021, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fir
e Victim Trust had not sold any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. On January 31, 2022, theFire Victim Trust initi
ated an exchange of 40,000,000 Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and TaxMatters Agreement and announ
ced that it had entered into a transaction for the sale of these shares.67

RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion presents PG&E Corpora

The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2021, 2020, and 2019.  The table separately identifies the revenuesand costs that impacted 
earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (suchas costs to purchase elec
tricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recoverthose pass-through costs, do not impa
ct earnings.68

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assetsand to provide the Utility an oppo
rtunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incursto own and operate its assets.

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings
The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2021, 2020, and 2019, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for theseperiods.
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $856 million, or 7%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due toincreased base revenues 
authorized in the 2020 GRC and FERC formula rates.The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $546 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due toincreased base revenues 
authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S rate cases, additional revenues recorded pursuant to the TO20 rate case, and CEMA interimrate relief.
Operating and Maintenance
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased by $421 million, or 7%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increasesin labor and insurance costs 
as well as a $135 million charge related to wildfire response and mitigation regulatory matters, including the 2020 WMCE settlement.These increases were par
tially offset by $298 million in previously deferred CEMA costs recorded in conjunction with interim rate relief in 2020, with nocomparable costs in 2021.

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased by $768 million, or 11%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to areduction in accele
rated transmission inspection and repair costs of approximately $460 million. Additionally, in 2019 the Utility recorded $398 million related tothe Wildfires OII set
tlement and $237 million in disallowed costs for previously incurred capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts in the 2019 GT&S ratecase in 2019, with no similar ch
arges in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $223 million in previously deferred CEMA costs recorded inconjunction with interim 
rate relief (see “2018 CEMA Application” below) (the Utility amortized $298 million in deferred CEMA costs in 2020, compared to $75million amortized 
in 2019). The Utility also experienced increased insurance premium costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.Wildfire-Related Claims, Net o
f RecoveriesCosts related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings increased by $7 million, or 3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $1.15 billionrelated to the 2021 Dixie f
ire, offset by $563 million of probable insurance recoveries, $347 million of probable recoveries through the WEMA, and $150 millionof probable recoveries 
from the Wildfire Fund in 2021, with no comparable charges and recoveries in 2020. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $175 millionrelated to the 2019 Kincade 
fire in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $625 million, partially offset by $430 million of probable insurancerecoveries in the yea
r ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $100 million related to the 2020 Zogg fire, fully offset by$100 million of probable insur
ance recoveries, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to pre-tax charges of $275 million, partially offset by $219million of probable insur
ance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2020.In addition to the probable wi
ldfire-related recoveries noted above, in 2021, the Utility recorded $101 million of probable recoveries through FERC TO formularates, which are record
ed as a reduction to regulatory liabilities and are not captured in wildfire-related claims, which along with the items noted above, fully offsetthe $1.15 billion charge re
lated to the 2021 Dixie fire.Costs related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings decreased by $11.2 billion, or 98%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of$625 million related to 
the 2019 Kincade fire, partially offset by $430 million of probable insurance recoveries, and pre-tax charges of $275 million related to the2020 Zogg fire, partially of
fset by $219 million of probable insurance recoveries in 2020. The Utility recognized charges of $11.4 billion in 2019, for wildfire-related claims pr
imarily associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 14 of the Not
es to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Wildfire Fund Expense
Wildfire fund expense th
at impacted earnings increased by $104 million, or 25%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility’sparticipation in the 
Wildfire Fund was limited to 40% for the period from July 12, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Additionally, the Utility recorded $43 million ofaccelerated amortization as a result 
of the Wildfire Fund receivable accrued in relation to the 2021 Dixie fire.Wildfire fund expense th
at impacted earnings increased by $413 million, or 100%, in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, the Utility became eligible to participate inthe Wildfire Fund and
 as a result recorded amortization and accretion expense related to the Wildfire Fund coverage received from the effective date of AB 1054through December 31, 2020.
See Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8.Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses decreased by $66 million, or 2%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a reductionin decommissioning expense th
at was recorded as a result of the final 2018 Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding decision.The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $236 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to capitaladditions and an increase 
in depreciation rates associated with the TO20 decision.70

Interest IncomeThe Utility’s interest 
income that impacted earnings decreased by $17 million, or 44%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Interest income decreased by $43 million, or52%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The Utili
ty’s interest income is primarily affected by changes in regulatory balancing accounts and changes in interest rates.Interest Expense
Interest expense that 
impacted earnings increased by $262 million, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.The Utility’s interest 
expense that impacted earnings increased by $199 million, or 22%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the issuance of new debt in2020 in connection with the eme

ange to reorganization items, net that impacted earnings in 2020 compared to 2019.Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
Income tax expense incr
eased by $492 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a DTA write-off associated with the grantor trust election for the FireVictim Trust in 2021, as compar
ed to a smaller DTA write-off associated with the decline in value of PG&E Corporation common stock contributed into a FireVictim Trust in the same p
eriod in 2020.The Utility’s income tax b
enefit increased by $3.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2019 compared to pre-tax income in 2020.Additionally, there was a $619 mi
llion adjustment from the measurement of the DTA associated with the difference between the liability recorded related to theTCC RSA and the ultimate value of PG&E Corporation s
tock contributed to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020. 71

ted as thesedifferences arise and reverse. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that 
these amounts will be recovered from orreturned to customers in future rates. In 2021 and 2020, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the
Tax Act passed in December 2017.
Includes the effect of the grantor trust election as discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financ

ments and non-tax deductible penalty costs in  2021 and 2020.Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings
Fluctuations in revenues tha
t did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information.Cost of Electricity
The Utility’s cost of ele
ctricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), fuel and associated transmissioncosts used in its own generation f
acilities, fuel and associated transmission costs supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply withCalifornia’s cap-and-
trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. Cost of electricity also includes net sales (Utility ownedgeneration and third par
ties) in the CAISO electricity markets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility’s totalpurchased power is driven by custom
er demand, net CAISO electricity market activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the Utility’s own generationfacilities (including Diablo

Operating and Maintenance ExpensesThe Utility’s operating exp
enses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred.  If the Utility were to spendmore than authorized a
mounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.Other Income, Net
The Utility’s other inc
ome, net that did not impact earnings includes pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that fluctuate primarily from market andinterest rate changes.
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RES
OURCESOverview
The Utility’s ability to 
fund operations, finance capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and make distributions to PG&E Corporationdepends on the levels of its ope
rating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregateamount of long-term and shor
t-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital. TheUtility generally uti
lizes retained earnings, equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-termcapital structure 
consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock and relies on short-term debt, including its revolving credit facilities, to fundtemporary financing ne
eds. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utilitya temporary, five-year waiver
 from compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund ope
rations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and fund equity contributions to the Utility depends on the levelof cash on hand, cash received 
from the Utility, and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters. Credit ratingdowngrades may impact the cos
t and availability of short-term borrowings, including credit facilities, and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the Utility’scommodity contracts contain
 collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral postingprovisions for some of the Util
ity’s power and natural gas commodity, and transportation and service agreements state that if the Utility’s credit ratings were to fallbelow investment grade, the Ut
ility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some or all of its net liability positions. TheUtility’s credit ra
tings fell below investment grade in January 2019, at which time the Utility was required to post additional collateral under its commoditypurchase agreements. A fur
ther downgrade would not materially impact the collateral postings for procurement activity. See Note 10 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have v
arious contractual commitments which impact cash requirements. These commitments are discussed in “Recognition ofLease Assets and Liabiliti
es” in Note 3, Note 5, Note 12, and “Purchase Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.COVID-19
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affectedby the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Th
e outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus (including Delta andOmicron), and the resulting 
economic conditions and government orders have had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s customersand, as a result, the
se circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for an indeterminate period of time. The principal areas of near-termimpact include liquid
ity, financial results and business operations, stemming primarily from the ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, themoratorium on service disc
onnections for residential and small business customers and for eligible medium and large commercial and industrial customers thatexpired on September 30, 2021, the CPUC’s “Emerg
ency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19 Protections”and an observed reduction in non-
residential electrical load. The Utility’s accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2021, wereapproximately $1.1 billion, o
r $832 million higher as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of theincrease directly 
attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections for as long as currentCOVID-19 circumstances persist.
73

On April 16, 2020, the CPUC adopted a resolution ordering utilities to implement a number of emergency customer protections, including a moratorium on servicedisconnections for residen
tial and small business customers, beginning on March 4, 2020, which it subsequently extended through June 30, 2021. The CPUCauthorized utiliti
es to establish memorandum accounts to track incremental costs associated with complying with the resolution. On April 19, 2021, the CPUCissued a final decision
 to implement a temporary moratorium on service disconnection for medium and large commercial and industrial customers. Although themoratorium on service d
isconnections ended on September 30, 2021, the Utility does not anticipate resuming service disconnections until 2022. If the moratoriumon service disconnections wer
e to be reinstated, it could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of PG&E Corporationand the Utility.
Although the Utility is seeking fu
rther regulatory relief to mitigate the impact of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance as to theamount or timing of such re
lief. On July 16, 2021, the California governor signed into law AB 135, which provides financing assistance to customer accounts inarrears. See “Assembly Bill 135
” below for more information. AB 135 allocates roughly $300 million in relief funding to the Utility’s customers and the amountwas paid on January 27, 2022.
As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had access to approximately $2.2 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately $165 millionof Utility cash, $126 million o
f PG&E Corporation cash and $1.9 billion of availability under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities. The2022 cost of capital appli
cation was filed off-cycle based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response. See “Cost ofCapital Proceedings” below for 
more information.The Utility has established 
the CPPMA memorandum accounts for tracking costs related to the CPUC’s emergency authorization and order, which, as of December31, 2021, totaled $49 million and is 
reflected in Long-term regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition to the $49 million recorded to theCPPMA that is subject to CPUC approval, the Utility has 
recorded approximately $127 million of undercollections from residential customers from June 11, 2020to December 31, 2021 to the RUBA, which has been approved by 
the CPUC and is reflected in Regulatory balancing accounts receivable on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. During the quart
er ended December 31, 2021, there was an adjustment to the RUBA current balancing accounts receivable of $180 million as aresult of the expected CAPP funding, which was r
eceived on January 27, 2022. For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PG&ECorporation and the Utility, se

For more information, see “AB 1054” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.On March 20, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court that includes a dividend restriction for PG&E Corporation.According to the dividend rest
riction, PG&E Corporation “will not pay common dividends until it has recognized $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earningsfollowing the Effective Da
te” of the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court entered the order approving the motion on April 9, 2020.In addition, the Corporation Revolv
ing Credit Agreement requires that PG&E Corporation (1) maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidatedcapitalization of no g
reater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) if revolving loans are outstanding as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio ofadjusted cash to fixed cha
rges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% prior to the date that PG&E Corporation first declares a cash dividend on itscommon stock and at least 100
% thereafter.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid. As of January 31, 2022, th
ere were $59.1 million of such cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. Additionally, theCPUC requires the Utility to maint
ain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in theChapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among oth
er things, grants the Utility a temporary, five-year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure forthe financing in place upon 
the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.Subject to the foregoing res
trictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, resul
ts of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of Directorsmay deem relevant. On Februa

Operating ActivitiesThe Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash.  During 2021, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $21.5 billion compared to the same period in2020.  This increase was primar
ily due to the payment of $18.8 billion in satisfaction of pre-petition wildfire-related claims in 2020 as compared to the payment of$758 million to the Fire Vict
im Trust in 2021. Additionally, the Utility made initial and first annual contributions to the Wildfire Fund of $5.2 billion during theyear ended December 31, 2020 as co
mpared to the $193 million contribution made during the year ended December 31, 2021. Lastly, the Utility paidapproximately $260 mill
ion more in interest in satisfaction of pre-petition claims during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2021. The increase waspartially offset by wild
fire-related insurance reimbursements of $2.2 billion received in 2020 as compared to $0.1 billion in 2021.During 2020, net cash provided by operat
ing activities decreased by $23.9 billion compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the payment of $18.8billion in satisfact
ion of pre-petition wildfire-related claims (including claims associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and the2015 Butte fire), and the ini
tial, first, and second annual contributions made to the Wildfire Fund of $5.2 billion, with no similar payments made in 2019.Future cash flow from operat
ing activities will be affected by various factors, including:•
the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, and the 2021 Dixie fire, and the timing and amount of anypotential related 
insurance, Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recoveries;•
the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, andregulatory matters 
(see “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” in Note 14 and “Enforcement Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);•
the severity, extent and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Utility’s service territory, the ability of the Utility to collect onits customer invoices, th
e ability of the Utility’s customers to pay their utility bills in full and in a timely manner, the ability of the Utility to offset theseeffects, including with spend
ing reductions, and the ability of the Utility to recover through rates any losses incurred in connection with the COVID-19pandemic, as well as the i
mpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability or cost of financing;•
the timing and amounts of available funds to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires;•
the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with 2020-2022 WMPs and the costs previously incurred in connection with the2019 WMP that are not current
ly being recovered through rates (see “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);•
the timing and amount of premium payments related to wildfire insurance (see “Insurance Coverage” in Note 14 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in Item
 8 for more information);•
the timing of the gain to be returned to customers from the sale of the SFGO and transmission tower wireless licenses and the amounts incurred related tothe move to and the leasing o
f the Lakeside Building; and•
the timing and outcomes of the Utility’s pending and future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, including the extent to which PG&E Corporation andthe Utility are able 
to recover their costs through regulated rates as recorded in memorandum accounts or balancing accounts, or as otherwise requested.PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not hav
e any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on their fin
ancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources,other than those discussed under 
“Purchase Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.77

Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing act
ivities decreased by $698 million during 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the sale ofthe SFGO, which resulted in net proceeds r
eceived of $749 million in September 2021, with no similar receipts in 2020. See “Application to Sell General OfficeComplex” below for more infor
mation.Net cash used in investing act
ivities increased by $1.4 billion during 2020 as compared to 2019 partially due to the payment of pre-petition vendor payables forcapital expenditures 
as a result of emerging from the Chapter 11 Cases. The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new andreplacement fac
ilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers. Cash used in investing activities also includes theproceeds from sales of nuc
lear decommissioning trust investments which are largely offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioningtrust investments.  The funds in 
the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling theUtility’s nuclear gene
ration facilities.Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurbetween $7.8 billion and $8.9 billion 
in 2022. Additionally, future cash flows used in investing activities will be impacted by the timing and amount related to theintended purchase of the Lak
eside Building.Financing Activities
During 2021, net cash provided by financ
ing activities decreased by $21.7 billion as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to PG&E Corporationmaking a cash equity contr
ibution to the Utility of approximately $13.0 billion in 2020, with no similar activity in 2021. Additionally, during 2021, the Utilityissued approximately $3.3 bil
lion less of long-term debt, net of repayments, as compared to the same period in 2020. In addition, the Utility had net borrowings of$4.6 billion under its credi
t facilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net repayments of $246 million during the same period in 2021. TheUtility had net borrowings of short
-term debt of $1.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net repayments of short-term debt of$1.2 billion during the same pe
riod in 2021. The decrease was partially offset by $1.5 billion of net repayments of debtor-in-possession credit facilities in 2020,with no similar payments in 2021. L
astly, the Utility received $370 million of proceeds in 2021 in connection with the Transaction Agreement between the Utilityand SBA, with no similar receipts in 2020. For 
more information, see “Sale of Transmission Tower Wireless Licenses” in Note 3 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.During 2020, net cash provided by financ
ing activities increased by $24.7 billion as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to PG&E Corporationmaking a cash equity contr
ibution to the Utility of approximately $13.0 billion, and the Utility receiving $10.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of short-termand long-term first mo
rtgage bonds, with no similar activities in 2019. Additionally, the Utility had net borrowings of $4.6 billion under its credit facilities duringthe year ended December 31, 2020, wi
th no similar activity in 2019 due to the Utility entering into the facilities in 2020. These increases were partially offset bynet repayments of $1.5 bill
ion on the debtor-in-possession facilities in 2020, as compared to net borrowings of $1.5 billion on the debtor-in-possession facilities in2019.
Cash provided by or used in financing a
ctivities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operatingactivities, the lev
el of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date or prepayment date of existingdebt instruments.  Additional
ly, future cash flows from financing activities will be affected by the timing and outcome of the Utility’s applications for a post-emergence securit
ization transaction and for an AB 1054 securitization transaction. See “Application for Post-Emergence Securitization Transaction” and“Application for AB 1054 Securitiz
ation Transaction” below for more information. ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATI
ON MATTERSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigationmatters described in Not
es 14 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. that are incorporated by reference herein. The outcome ofthese matters, individu
ally or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.

U.S. District Court Matters and ProbationOn August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court imposed a sentence on the Utility in connection with the conviction. The courtsentenced the Utility to 
a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by the Monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years, a fine of 
$3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.In the course of 2021, the court 
entered numerous other orders, including in connection with the Utility’s vegetation management, the Utility’s PSPS program, the2018 Camp fire, the 2019 Kincade fi
re, the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2021 Dixie fire.On January 25, 2022, the period of probation 
expired and the Monitor’s oversight of the Utility ended.Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process
In the OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization final decision, the CPUC adopted an EOEP designed to provide a roadmap forhow the CPUC will monitor the Utility’s oper
ational performance on an ongoing basis. The EOEP contains six steps that are triggered by specific events andincludes enhanced report
ing requirements and additional monitoring and oversight. These trigger events include failure to obtain an approved WMP, failure tocomply with regulatory repo
rting requirements in the WMP, insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments and failure to comply with ordemonstrate suffici
ent progress toward certain metrics (some of which will be determined in an ongoing regulatory proceeding). The EOEP also containsprovisions for the Utility to 
cure and permanently exit the EOEP if it can satisfy specific criteria. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, actions taken would occurin coordination with the CPUC’s existing fo
rmal and informal reporting requirements and procedures. The EOEP does not replace or limit the CPUC’s regulatoryauthority, including the au
thority to issue Orders to Show Cause and Orders Instituting Investigations and to impose fines and penalties. The EOEP requires theUtility to report the oc
currence of a triggering event to the CPUC’s executive director no later than five business days after the date on which any member of seniormanagement of the Utility 
becomes aware of the occurrence of a triggering event.The Utility is unable to pred
ict whether additional fines or penalties may be imposed, or other regulatory actions may be taken.On August 18, 2021, the President of the CPUC informed the Uti
lity that the CPUC staff intends to conduct a fact-finding review regarding a pattern of self-reported missed inspect
ions and other self-reported safety incidents to determine whether a recommendation to advance the Utility further within the EOEP iswarranted.
Vegetation Management
The CPUC placed the Utility into step 1 of 
the EOEP on April 15, 2021 and imposed additional reporting requirements on the Utility. The CPUC’s resolutionstates that a step 1 tr
iggering event had occurred because the Utility “has made insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments related toits electric business.
” The resolution finds that, based on the CPUC’s evaluation of the Utility’s EVM work in 2020, the Utility “is not sufficiently prioritizing itsEnhanced Vegetation Managem
ent (“EVM”) based on risk” and “is not making risk-driven investments.” The resolution also finds that “less than five percent ofthe EVM work” the Utility comple
ted in 2020 “was on the 20 highest risk power lines according to [its] own risk rankings.”As required by the CPUC’s resolution, the Util
ity submitted a corrective action plan to the CPUC’s Executive Director on May 6, 2021, which is designed tocorrect or prevent r
ecurrence of the step 1 triggering event, or otherwise mitigate any ongoing safety risk or impact, as soon as practicable, among other things. Thecorrective action p
lan addresses the EVM situation that occurred in 2020 and provides a risk-informed EVM workplan for 2021. The Utility is required to updatethe information conta
ined in the corrective action plan every 90 days. The Utility will remain in step 1 of the EOEP until the CPUC determines that the Utility hasmet the conditions of the 
corrective action plan. If the Utility does not adequately meet such conditions within the timeframe approved by the CPUC, the CPUCmay place the Utility 
into a higher step of the EOEP, or the Utility may remain in step 1 of the EOEP if it demonstrates sufficient progress towards meeting suchconditions.
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this regulatory process.79

Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Safety CultureOn August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprioritize safety 
and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The CPUC directedthe SED to evaluate the Utili
ty’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to theUtility’s record of oper
ations, including its record of safety incidents.On June 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting comm
ents from parties on four proposals that it stated may improve the safety culture of PG&ECorporation and the Utility. The 
four proposals are: separating the Utility into gas and electric utilities (including, as one possibility, sale of the gas assets to a thirdparty); establishing pe
riodic review of the Utility’s certificate of convenience and necessity; modifying or eliminating PG&E Corporation’s holding companystructure; and linking th
e Utility’s rate of return or ROE to safety performance metrics.On September 4, 2020, the administr
ative law judge issued a ruling updating case status, which states that the proceeding will remain open as a vehicle to monitorthe progress of the Utility 
in improving its safety culture, and to address any relevant issues that arise, with the CPUC’s consultant NorthStar Consulting Group,Inc. continuing in a monitor
ing role. The ruling states that additional issues may be raised in the proceedings by parties or the CPUC.REGULATORY MATTERS
The Utility is subject to subst
antial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of theproceedings described below and o
ther proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
During 2021, the Utility continued to 
make progress on regulatory matters.•
In June, the Utility filed its 2023 GRC application. The application requests a revenue requirement of $15.46 billion for the 2023 test year.•
In August, the CPUC approved the Utility’s agreement to sell the SFGO. In September, the sale closed.•
In September, OEIS issued a final decision statement approving the Utility’s 2021 WMP, and in October the CPUC ratified the OEIS’ approval.•
In September, the Utility filed a motion seeking CPUC approval of a settlement agreement for its 2020 WMCE application. Under the settlementagreement, the Utili
ty would recover a revenue requirement of $1.04 billion, or 81% of the requested $1.28 billion.•
In September, the Utility filed its 2021 WMCE application, requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.6 billion of recorded expenditures related towildfire mitigation, 
certain catastrophic events, and a number of other activities, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.47billion.
•
In October, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement among the Utility and other parties that authorizes the Utility to recover $445.5 million inincremental insuran
ce costs in its WEMA that were incurred for the period of July 26, 2017 through December 31, 2019.•
In November, the Utility filed a motion seeking CPUC approval of a settlement agreement for its 2018 CEMA application. Under the settlementagreement, the Utili
ty would recover approximately $683 million plus interest, compared to the requested $763 million.In addition, on January 31, 2022, the OEIS issued th
e Utility’s 2021 safety certification, which will be valid for 12 months or until a timely request for a new safetycertification is acted upon,
 whichever occurs later.80

Cost Recovery ProceedingsPeriodically, costs aris
e that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests or that have been deliberately excluded therefrom.These costs may result fro
m catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to trackincremental costs in 
a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incrementaland prudently incurred. The CPUC also author
ized balancing accounts with limitations or caps to cost recovery. These accounts, which include the CEMA,WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RT
BA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster andwildfire response, other wild
fire prevention-related costs, certain third-party wildfire claims, and insurance costs. While the Utility generally expects such costs tobe recoverable, ther
e can be no assurance that the CPUC will authorize the Utility to recover the full amount of its costs.In recent years, the a
mount of the costs recorded in these accounts has increased. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility had recorded an aggregate amount ofapproximately $5.4 billion 
in costs not otherwise being recovered in existing revenue requirements, if any, for the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA,VMBA, WMBA, MGMA, and RTBA. Because rate recovery may require CPUC authoriz
ation for these accounts, there is a delay between when the Utility incurscosts and when it may recover 
those costs.If the amount of the costs 
recorded in these accounts continues to increase, the delay between incurring and recovering costs lengthens, or the Utility does notrecover the full amoun
t of its costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materiallyaffected.
Except as otherwise noted, the Ut
ility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs included in these applications.For more information, see Not
e 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8., “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Mitigation and CatastrophicEvents Costs Recovery Applications,” “Regu
latory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account,” and“Regulatory Matters - Cat
astrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications” below.Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Reco
very Applications2020 WMCE Application
On September 30, 2020, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation and certaincatastrophic events (
the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which exclude amounts disallowed as a result of the CPUC’s decision in the OIIinto the 2017 Northern Californi
a wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, consist of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capital expenditures, resulting in aproposed revenue requirem
ent of approximately $1.28 billion.The costs addressed in the 2020 WMCE appl
ication cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and are incremental to those previously authorized in theUtility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The Ut
ility’s request includes amounts from the FHPMA of $293 million, the FRMMA and the WMPMA of $740million, and the CEMA of $251 million.
Given the CPUC’s prior approval of $447 mill
ion in interim rate relief (which includes interest), the Utility proposed to recover the remaining $868 millionrevenue requirement ov
er a one-year period (following the conclusion of interim rate relief recovery). Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to theCPUC’s reasonableness review, which could resu
lt in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund.On September 21, 2021, the Utility and c
ertain parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would resolve all of theissues raised by the settl
ing parties in the 2020 WMCE application. The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility recover a revenue requirement of $1.04billion. The settlement agreeme
nt would authorize the Utility to continue to recover the interim revenue requirement of $447 million over a 17-month amortizationperiod, followed by an additiona
l revenue requirement of $591 million over a 24-month amortization period. On September 23, 2021, the CPUC extended thestatutory deadline for 
a PD in this matter to April 1, 2022.81

2021 WMCE ApplicationOn September 16, 2021, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.6 billion of recorded expenditures, resultingin a proposed revenue requir
ement of approximately $1.47 billion (the “2021 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related towildfire mitigation 
and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2020.The recorded expenditures 
consist of $1.4 billion in expenses and $197 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2021 WMCE application areincremental to those p
reviously authorized in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, 2020 GRC, and other proceedings. The majority of the Utility’s proposed revenuerequirement would be coll
ected over a two-year period starting in January 2023.The Utility’s requested r
evenue requirement includes amounts recorded to the VMBA of $592 million, the CEMA of $535 million, the WMBA of $149 million,and other memo accounts. On Novembe
r 18, 2021, the Utility filed updates to the application, increasing total costs by $19.4 million. On December 30, 2021, theUtility filed supplemen
tal testimony reducing the cost recovery ask of the COVID-19 CEMA costs by $12.2 million. The $12.2 million reduction is a result ofidentified avoided costs, su
ch as employee business travel expenses and in-person training costs, due to the pandemic.The scoping memo shows a schedule with th
e CPUC issuing a PD in the fourth quarter of 2022.Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account Application
On February 7, 2020, the Utility filed 
an application requesting cost recovery of $499 million of insurance premiums paid by the Utility between July 26, 2017through December 31, 2019, which were re
corded in the WEMA. These costs are incremental to the insurance costs authorized in the 2017 GRC. Theseincremental costs a
re not associated with any specific wildfire event. The application does not seek recovery of wildfire claims or associated legal costs eligible forrecording to the WEMA. On October 21, 2021, the CPUC adopted a 
final decision approving a settlement agreement among the Utility and the other active partiesthat authorizes the Uti
lity to recover $445.5 million over a 12-month period beginning January 1, 2022.Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application
The CPUC allows utilities to recover 
the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergencyby competent federal o
r state authorities. The Utility has historically sought such costs through standalone CEMA applications. More recently, the Utility hassought CEMA-eligible costs through its 
WMCE applications.In addition to the Utility
’s responsibilities in responding to catastrophic events, in 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention andvegetation managemen
t work in response to the severe drought in California. Through 2019, the costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA. In the2020 GRC decision, the CPUC required the Utility to t
rack these costs in the VMBA beginning January 1, 2020.2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophicevents that included fi
re and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017to cut back or remove dead o
r dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The Utility filed three revisions to thisapplication, resulting 
in a total cost recovery request of $763 million.On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s reques
t for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at thattime. The interim r
ate relief was implemented, commencing on October 1, 2019. Costs included in the interim rate relief are subject to audit and refund.On November 2, 2021, the Utility filed wi
th the CPUC a settlement agreement with the active parties in the matter. The settlement agreement, if approved by theCPUC, would authorize the Utility to coll
ect a total of $683 million plus interest for the 2018 CEMA application. As noted above, $373 million of the total amounthas already been colle
cted in interim rates. The interim rates would become final and no longer subject to refund. The remainder of the authorized revenuerequirement that has y
et to be collected would be amortized over a 12-month period.82

Forward-Looking Rate CasesThe Utility routinely par
ticipates in forward-looking rate case applications before the CPUC and the FERC. Those applications include GRCs, where the revenuerequired for general op
erations (“base revenue”) of the Utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Utility is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust itsregulated return on ra
te base.Decisions in GRC proceedings are gener
ally expected prior to the commencement of the period to which the rates would apply. However, delayed decisions in theUtility’s GRCs may cause the Utili
ty to develop its budgets based on possible outcomes, rather than authorized amounts. When decisions are delayed, the CPUCtypically provides rate relief t
o the Utility effective as of the commencement of the rate case period (not effective as of the date of the delayed decision).Nonetheless, the Utility’s spend
ing during the period of the delay may exceed the authorized amount, without an ability for the Utility to seek cost recovery of suchexcess. If the Utility’s sp
ending during the period of the delay is less than the authorized amount, the Utility could be exposed to operational and financial riskassociated with the lower l
evel of work achieved compared to that funded by the CPUC.Except as otherwise noted, the Ut
ility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected depending on the outcomes of these applications.The Utility’s rate cas
es that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed in 2021 are summarized in the following table:Rate Case

Revenue requirement of $416 m illionSettlement agreement to recover $356 million of revenuerequirement filed Ju
ly 2021.2023 General Rate Case
On June 30, 2021, the Utility filed its 2023 GRC appli
cation with the CPUC. The 2023 GRC combined what had historically been separated into the GRC andGT&S rate cases. In the 2023 GRC, the CPUC will determin
e the annual amount of base revenues that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from2023 through 2026 to recover its ant
icipated costs for gas distribution, gas transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation and to provide theUtility an opportunity to ea
rn its authorized rate of return. The Utility’s revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, andelectricity and na
tural gas purchases, are authorized in other regulatory proceedings overseen by the CPUC or the FERC.In a GRC, the CPUC approves annual revenue require
ments for the first year (a “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annualincreases in revenue r
equirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as “attrition years”). For its 2023 test year, the Utility has requested revenuerequirements of $15.46 bill
ion, an increase of $3.56 billion over the adopted 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S revenue requirements for 2022 of $11.90 billion. TheGRC application further stat
es that the Utility’s requested 2023 revenue requirements represent a 9.6% increase over its total revenue requirements for 2022(including both amounts that 
are authorized and that are requested outside of the GRC and remain subject to the regulatory process). The requested weighted-average GRC rate base for 2023 is app
roximately $48.52 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $9.35 billion over the authorized rate base for 2022 of $39.17billion. The Utility also r
equested that the CPUC establish a ratemaking mechanism that would increase the Utility’s authorized GRC revenues in 2024, 2025, and2026 by $930 million, $590 million, and $381 m
illion, respectively. The Utility estimated its proposed revenue requirements for 2024, 2025, and 2026 would resultin revenue requiremen
t increases of 2.4%, 1.9%, and 1.5%, compared to its total estimated revenue requirements for 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. Over the2023-2026 GRC period, the Utility plans to mak
e average annual capital investments of approximately $7.75 billion in gas distribution, transmission and storage,electric distribution, and electric
 generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.83

These amounts include revenues from Decision (“D.”) 20-12-005 (the Utility’s 2020 GRC), D.19-09-025 (the Utility’s 2019 GT&S) adjusted for D.19-12-056 and Advice Letter (“AL”) 4275-
G/5887-E (Cost of Capital changes adopted for Long Term Debt and Common Stock) and AL 4367-G/6062-E (Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act).
Also included are the 2022 adopted revenue requirements associated with the following previously separately-funded projects: AL 5322-E (Energy Storage), D.16-12-065 (Electric Vehicle
Charging Network Phase I), D.14-03-021 (Mobile Home Park to the Meter), D.20-11-035 (2019 CEMA), AL 4392-
G/6100-E (WMBA and VMBA), AL 4444-G/6210-E (RTBA).In the 2023 GRC application, the Utili
ty proposed a series of safety, resiliency, and clean energy investments to further reduce wildfire risk and deliver safe,reliable, and clean 
energy service. Among other things, the Utility proposed to invest a total of approximately $31 billion between 2023 and 2026 to reducewildfire risk; improve g
as and electric system safety, reliability, and resiliency; increase the use of new, innovative technologies; and expand its clean energyinfrastructure.
In addition to coverage th
at may be available from the private insurance market, the Utility also proposed to use self-insurance as part of its wildfire insuranceprogram as follows: (1) the Ut
ility’s recommended approach, a new self-insurance structure whereby the Utility would seek customer-funded self-insurance in theamount of $250 million annual
ly and traditional private insurance procurement for amounts between the accumulated self-insurance balance and $1.0 billion; or,alternatively (2) continuing
 the currently authorized mechanism whereby the Utility seeks procurement of wildfire liability insurance instruments through theprivate insurance ma
rket and is authorized to use any unspent authorized revenue requirements on self-insurance.In addition, the Utility r
equested authorization to establish one new balancing account and one new memorandum account as follows:•
Catastrophic Events Straight-Time Labor Balancing Account, a two-way account which would recover straight-time labor costs associated withcatastrophic events. Thes
e costs are currently recovered through the Catastrophic Events Memorandum Account process.•
Helms Capacity Memorandum Account, which would allow the Utility to track and recover the actual costs associated with upgrading the Helms PumpedStorage Facility through a fu
ture application.The Utility did not seek recov
ery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers within the scope of 17 Code of Federal Regulations 240.3b-7.On October 1, 2021, the CPUC issued a scoping memo indica
ting that the CPUC will issue a decision on an initial track of the proceeding in the second quarter of2023. The scoping memo also establ
ished a second track of the 2023 GRC to consider costs incurred from 2019 to 2021 that are recorded in balancing ormemorandum accounts for, 
among other work, wildfire mitigation and gas system safety improvements. The second track will review more than $500 million incapital and $160 million 
in expense included in the Utility’s initial 2023 GRC application for the period from 2019 to 2020, plus additional costs recorded inmemorandum and balancing 
accounts in 2021. The scoping memo indicated that the CPUC will issue a decision on the second track in the third quarter of 2023.The scoping memo also direc
ted the Utility to file an update for itsundergrounding program in February 2022.
On November 5, 2021, the Utility filed 
a motion to revise the proceeding schedule.Between August 2021 and January 2022, the Utility s
erved updates to its 2023 GRC testimony that would, if approved, reduce the requested revenue requirementin 2023 by approximately $181 mil
lion in the aggregate. (1) (2)

2020 General Rate CaseOn December 3, 2020, the CPUC approved the final de
cision for the Utility’s 2020 GRC.Revenue Requirements and Attrit
ion Year RevenuesThe final decision approved 
a 2020 authorized revenue requirement of $9.102 billion, effective January 1, 2020. The CPUC also approved the revenuerequirements for 2021 and 2022 as 
follows: an additional increase of $316 million in 2021 over the authorized 2020 revenue requirement, or a 3.5% increase, andan additional increas
e of $364 million in 2022, or a 3.9% increase. The Utility is authorized to collect in rates the difference between the revenue requirement ineffect and the 2020 GRC decision-au
thorized revenue requirement for the period of January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 over the period of March 1, 2021 throughDecember 31, 2022.
The final decision also a
llows the Utility to recover the annual cost of excess liability insurance for coverage of up to $1.4 billion. An advice letter is required forrecovery of excess liab
ility insurance costs for coverage exceeding $1.4 billion. The final decision also approved wildfire mitigation capital expenditures in theCommunity Wildfire Safe
ty Program of $603 million in 2020, $931 million in 2021 and $1.15 billion in 2022. In addition, the final decision requires areasonableness review and r
ecovery of WMBA costs or unit costs for system hardening in excess of 115% of the adopted amounts and VMBA costs in excess of120% of the adopted amounts through 
an application.Rate Base and Capital Additions
The CPUC also adopted a rate base of $31.0 bil
lion in 2021, or a 5.4% increase over 2020; and $33.0 billion in 2022, or a 6.3% increase over 2021. Consistentwith AB 1054, the decision provides for a to
tal of $2.83 billion in forecast capital spend without an equity return for the period of August 2019 to December 2022,which includes $931 million for 2021 
and $1.15 billion for 2022.Over the 2020-2022 GRC period, the decision provid
ed average annual capital investments of approximately $4.5 billion in electric distribution, natural gasdistribution and electric ge
neration infrastructure.2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
As previously disclosed, on September 12, 2019, 
the CPUC approved the final decision in the 2019 GT&S rate case of the Utility. The CPUC adopted revenuerequirements of $1.516 bill
ion for 2021 and $1.580 billion for 2022, compared to the Utility’s request of $1.693 billion for 2021 and $1.679 billion for 2022.On October 23, 2019, the Utility filed 
an application with the CPUC requesting the rehearing of the final decision. Specifically, issues identified by the Utilityinclude the adopted disal
lowance associated with vintage pipe replacement, reduction in the Utility’s expense forecast for in-line inspections, and establishment ofa memo account for Int
ernal Corrosion Direct Assessment. On November 19, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision denying the Utility’s application for rehearing butallowing the Utility to fi
le an advice letter to remove the 2015 portion of the capital vintage pipe replacement disallowance. The advice letter was approved by theCPUC on January 21, 2022.
Removing the 2015 value of $39.4 mill
ion from the disallowance reduced the total disallowed amount from $237.3 million to $197.9 million.Cost of Capital Proceedings
On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final dec
ision in the 2020 cost of capital application (the “2020 cost of capital application”), maintaining theUtility’s return on common 
equity at the 2019 level of 10.25% for the three-year period beginning January 1, 2020. The decision maintained the common equitycomponent of the Utility’s 
capital structure at 52% and reduced its preferred stock component from 1% to 0.5%. The decision also approved the cost of debtrequested by the Utility.
85

The Utility’s annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism, which allows for changes in the Utility’s authorized ROE and cost of debt, also remained unchanged bythe final 2020 cost of capi
tal application decision. The mechanism provides that in any year in which the difference between (i) the average Moody’s utility bondrates (as measured in 
the 12-month period from October through September (the index)) and (ii) 4.5% (the benchmark) exceeds 100 basis points, the Utility’s ROEwill be adjusted by one-half o
f such difference, and the cost of debt will be trued up to the most recent recorded cost of debt. The Utility is to initiate thisadjustment mechanism by 
filing an advice letter on or before October 15 of the year in which the mechanism triggered, to become effective on January 1 of thenext year.
On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off
-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic andrelated government r
esponse, which has decreased interest rates but has not reduced the cost of capital for electric utilities in general, and the Utility in particular,to the same extent as th
e overall financial markets (the “2022 cost of capital application”). The 2022 cost of capital application requested that the CPUC authorizethe Utility's cost of capi
tal for its electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning onJanuary 1, 2022 for 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Utility r
equested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital structure (i.e., the relativeweightings of common equity, pre
ferred equity, and debt for ratemaking), ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt. The Utility proposed to establish a cost oflong-term debt of 4.14%, a r
eturn on preferred stock of 5.52%, a ROE of 11%, and to retain the existing capital structure. The Utility also concurrently filed amotion requesting that th
e revenue requirement for the 2022 cost of capital be recorded in memorandum accounts to be trued-up following a final decision in thisproceeding.
In September 2021, the cost of c
apital adjustment mechanism was triggered because the index was 117 basis points below the benchmark. As the 2022 cost ofcapital applicat
ion was pending, the Utility did not file the October 15, 2021 advice letter to adjust rates. Subsequently, on October 28, 2021, the CPUC ruled thatthe 2022 cost of capital app
lication did not suspend the adjustment mechanism as requested by the application. The ruling also required that the Utility comply withthe cost of capital m
echanism by filing the information that would have been included in the October 15, 2021 advice letter in the 2022 cost of capital applicationproceeding on November 8, 2021, which the Uti
lity did.On December 17, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decis
ion authorizing the Utility’s request to establish memorandum accounts to track revenue requirementchanges starting on January 1, 2022 and 
leaving the cost of capital rates at current levels, subject to true-up based on the CPUC’s decision on the 2022 cost ofcapital application.
On December 24, 2021, the CPUC issued a scoping memo in th
e 2022 cost of capital application limiting the scope of the Utility’s 2022 cost of capital applicationto the 2022 cost of capital on
ly. The scoping memo also affirmed that the Utility is to file a 2023 cost of capital application in April 2022 for the 2023 test year.To set the 2022 cost of capita
l, the CPUC will consider (i) whether there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capitalmechanism for 2022; and (i
i) if so, whether to leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for the year 2022, or open a second phase to consideralternative cost of 
capital proposals for the year 2022. The Utility’s position is that there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost ofcapital mechanism 
for 2022 and that the CPUC should leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022.If the CPUC 
determines that the 2022 cost of capital application establishes extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capitalmechanism for 2022 and leav
es the Utility’s cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022, the cost of long-term debt would be 4.17%, the return onpreferred stock would be 5.52%, and 
the ROE would be 10.25%. If the CPUC opens a second phase of the proceeding, the CPUC would set the cost of capital for2022 based on alternative cos
t of capital proposals that would address the technical cost of capital material included within the Utility’s 2022 cost of capitalapplication.
If the CPUC 
determines that there are not extraordinary circumstances that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022, the cost of capitaladjustment mechanism would op
erate and the cost of long-term debt would be 4.15%, the return on preferred stock would be 5.52%, and the ROE would be 9.67%.The resulting decrease 
in the CPUC jurisdictional gas and electric revenue requirement would be approximately $163 million ($99 million electric and $64 milliongas).
The scoping memo called fo
r briefing to be completed by March 25, 2022 but did not indicate timing for a PD or final decision.86

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate CaseOn June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decis
ion in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case. The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696million of 2011 to 2014 capita
l spending in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of thatamount and ordered that th
e remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in afuture proceeding. For more 
information regarding this proceeding, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Transmission Owner Rate Cases
Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
As previously disclosed, on January 8, 2018, the Nin
th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of the FERC’s decisions in the TO16 andTO17 rate cases that had gran
ted the Utility a 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. If the FERC concluded on remandthat the Utility should no longe
r be authorized to receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5million for TO16 and TO17, respectiv
ely. Those rate case decisions were remanded to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Ninth Circuit Court ofAppeals’ opinion.
On July 18, 2019, the FERC issued its order on remand re
affirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50-basis point ROE adder.On March 17, 2020, the FERC issued its order denying requ
ests for rehearing that were previously filed by several parties. On May 11, 2020, the CPUC and anumber of other parties 
filed a petition for review of the FERC’s orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held on April 16, 2021.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on July 29, 2016, the Util
ity filed its TO18 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of$1.72 billion, a $387 million inc
rease over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7billion.  The Utility sought a ROE of 10.9%, which 
included an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO. On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among o
ther things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required theallocation of all co
mmon plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for thelimited purpose of allowing 
the participants to the proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodologyadopted in FERC Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020. Initial bri
efs and testimony were filed on December 14, 2020 and responses were filed on February12, 2021.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying 
requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utilityfiled four appeals. The app
eals related to two issues: (1) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (2) aspects of the rehearing orderother than the Tax Act. The appe
als have been consolidated and are currently being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue.As a result of an order denying r
ehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its Regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during theTO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 th
rough the fourth quarter of 2021 by approximately $324 million. A portion of these common plant costs areexpected to be recover
ed at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, as of December 31, 2021, the Utility has recorded approximately $197 million toRegulatory assets.
Aside from the ultimat
e outcome of the common plant allocation, which is subject to further appellate briefing and a further FERC decision on ROE, that order isnot expected to result in 
a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Some of the issues that will bedecided in a final and unapp
ealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s TO19 and TO20 rate cases.See “Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subj
ect to Refund” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.87

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)As previously disclosed, on July 27, 2017, the Util
ity filed its TO19 rate case with the FERC. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving an all-party settlement f
iled by the Utility. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that willbe determined upon the issuan
ce of a final, non-appealable TO18 decision. Additionally, if the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals were to determine that the Utilitywas not entitled to the 50 basis po
int incentive adder for the Utility’s continued CAISO participation, then the Utility would be obligated to make a refund tocustomers of approximat
ely $25 million. See “Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016” above for a discussion of the incentive adder. On December 20,2018, the FERC issued an order approving the al
l-party settlement.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2018, the Ut
ility filed its TO20 rate case with the FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated withthe Utility’s elect
ric transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings andrefund, and established May 1, 2019 as 
the effective date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pending settlementdiscussions among the parties.
On March 31, 2020, the Utility filed 
a partial settlement with the FERC, which the FERC approved on August 17, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the Utility filed asettlement with the FERC resolving 
all of the remaining issues in the formula rate proceedings, including the Utility’s ROE, capital structure, depreciation rates, aswell as certain other 
aspects of the Utility’s formula rate. Specifically, the settlement establishes an all-in ROE of 10.45%; a fixed capital structure of 49.75%common stock, 49.75% debt, and 0.5% pre
ferred stock; and fixed depreciation rates for various categories of transmission facilities (represented by individualFERC accounts). The term of the set
tlement continues until December 31, 2023 and the Utility will be required to file a replacement rate filing to be effective onJanuary 1, 2024.
On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the settl
ement without modifications.Some of the issues that will be d
ecided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into theUtility’s TO19 and TO20 rate cases.
Other Regulatory Proceedings
Application to Sell General Office Compl
exOn September 30, 2020, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC to sell the SFGO located at 25 Beale Street, 45 Beale Street, 77 Beale Street, 50 MainStreet, 215 Market Street 
and 245 Market Street in downtown San Francisco, and to recover costs to relocate its staff at the SFGO to a new headquarters at theLakeside Building, and for appropr
iate ratemaking treatment of those transactions.On May 21, 2021, the Utility entered in
to a purchase agreement with HNG Atlas US LP, to sell the SFGO for $800 million.On May 26, 2021, the Utility filed an a
mended settlement agreement with the CPUC. Under the amended settlement, the parties agreed that (1) the Utility’sheadquarters strategy, 
including the move to the Lakeside Building, the sale of the SFGO, and the terms of the agreement to lease and the option to purchase theLakeside Building, is reasonabl
e, (2) all of the net gain on sale of the SFGO will be distributed to customers over five years, beginning in 2022, and (3) the costsassociated with the Utili
ty’s move to the Lakeside Building and development will be considered at later stages of the proceeding through a petition for modificationof the final decision in 
the proceeding.The CPUC issued a final decision approving th
e purchase agreement and the ratemaking treatment proposed under the parties’ settlement on August 19, 2021, andthe sale closed on Septembe
r 17, 2021. The final decision defers, until the petition for modification, determinations as to the amount of the Utility’s cost recoveryin connection with the anti
cipated purchase of the Lakeside Building and operating and capital expenses related to the transition to the Lakeside Building.88

Application for Post-Emergence Securitization TransactionOn April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an 
application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfireclaims costs through secur
itization that is designed to be rate neutral to customers, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment ofwildfire claims costs 
associated with 2017 Northern California wildfires. Among other uses, as a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire $6.0billion of Utility debt. Spec
ifically, the application requested administration of the stress test methodology approved in the CHT OIR and a determination that $7.5billion in 2017 catastrophi
c wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs and eligible for securitization. In this context, a securitization refers to a financingtransaction where a spec
ial purpose financing vehicle issues new debt that is secured by the proceeds of a new recovery charge to Utility customers. Theapplication also proposed a 
customer credit designed to equal the bond charges over the life of the bonds, which would insulate customers from the charge oncustomer bills associa
ted with the bonds.On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 b
illion of the Utility’s 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs that maybe financed through the issuan
ce of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections 850 et seq.  and approving a structure fo r the transaction. Asrequested, the decision au
thorizes the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders, that will provide a monthly credit tocustomers that is anti
cipated to equal the securitized charges such that the securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. Subject to retention of theCPUC’s existing jurisdiction, the dec
ision adopts a transaction structure comprised of four elements (1) an initial shareholder contribution of $2.0 billion, with $1.0billion to be contributed 
in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded by certain shareholder taxbenefits; (3) a single CPUC review of 
the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental shareholder contribution, if needed,up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sha
ring with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit trust at the end of the life of the trust.Three parties filed 
applications for rehearing of the decision on May 3, 2021, and the Utility filed a response to those applications on May 14, 2021. On August 12,2021, the CPUC issued a decision denying the appli
cations for rehearing.Separately, on January 6, 2021, the Uti
lity filed an additional application requesting that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or moreseries of recovery bonds in conn
ection with the post-emergence transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017Northern California wildfi
res. On May 11, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Utility’s January 2021 application for a financing order authorizing theissuance of $7.5 billion of re
covery bonds in connection with the rate neutral securitization proceeding. Two parties filed applications for rehearing of the financingorder, and the Utility fi
led a response to those applications for rehearing on June 4, 2021. On August 12, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision denying theapplications for rehearing.
On September 10, 2021, TURN filed a petition fo
r writ of review of the decision and financing order in state court. Responses to the petition were filed on October15, 2021. TURN filed a reply in support of the pe
tition on November 9, 2021.Application for AB 1054 Securitization Transaction
AB 1054 provides that the first $5.0 bil
lion expended in the aggregate by California’s three large electric IOUs on fire risk mitigation capital expenditures includedin their respective 
approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures has been allocated among thelarge electric 
IOUs in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. The Utility’s allocation is $3.21 billion. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.) AB 1054 contemplates that such capital expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customercharge.
On February 24, 2021 the Utility filed 
an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a transaction to finance, using securitization, up to $1.19 billion offire risk mitigat
ion capital expenditures that were or will be incurred by the Utility in 2020 and 2021, with the final amount to be financed based on recorded 2020and 2021 Community Wildfire Saf
ety Program capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction.The application request
ed that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds andcollection through fixed 
recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest and would reduce rates on a present value basis compared totraditional utili
ty financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.  Theapplication also reques
ted to exclude the securitized debt from the Utility’s ratemaking capital structure and to adjust its 2020 GRC revenue requirement followingthe issuance of the recov
ery bonds. 89

On June 24, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Utility’s application and authorizing the Utility to issue up to approximately $1.2 billion of recoverybonds. On July 6, 2021, the financing order bec
ame final and non-appealable. On November 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $860million of senior secur
ed recovery bonds. The recovery bonds were issued in three tranches: (1) approximately $266 million with an interest rate of 1.46% and isdue July 15, 2033, (2) approximately $160 
million with an interest rate of 2.28% and is due January 15, 2038, and (3) approximately $434 million with an interestrate of 2.82% and is due July 15, 2048.    
2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
As previously disclosed, on February 7, 2020, the Ut
ility submitted its 2020 WMP and the related utility survey. The Utility’s 2020 WMP describes the Utility’swildfire safety progra
ms, which are focused on three key areas: reducing the potential for fires to be started by electrical equipment, reducing the potential for firesto spread, and minimizing 
the frequency, scope and duration of PSPS events, as well as providing historical data. The Utility’s 2020 WMP covers a three-yearperiod from 2020 to 2022 but is updated 
annually.The Utility’s 2021 WMP was submitted on Febru
ary 5, 2021. The 2021 WMP updated the 2020 WMP and addressed the Utility’s wildfire safety programs focusedon reducing the potential 
for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires to spread and reducing the impact of PSPSevents.
On September 22, 2021, OEIS issued a final ac
tion statement approving the Utility’s 2021 WMP and on October 21, 2021, the CPUC ratified OEIS’s approval.In 2021, the Utility notified 
the CPUC that it had missed inspections and other targets subject to the 2020 WMP. The Utility is undertaking a review of its electricasset inspections. For more in
formation, see “Electric Asset Inspections” below.On December 16, 2021, the CPUC closed the WMP proceeding, no
ting that OEIS is now responsible for review and approval of the WMP.OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to determine 
“whether California’s IOUs prioritized safety and complied with the CPUC’s regulations andrequirements with respe
ct to their PSPS events in late 2019.”On June 7, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision in the 
case that found each of the large electric IOUs to be noncompliant with CPUC-required guidelines incertain of their 2019 PSPS events. The de
cision included a financial remedy and a number of corrective actions. The financial remedy consists of forgoingcollection of revenues 
from customers associated with electricity not sold during future PSPS events until it can be demonstrated that the utilities have madeimprovements in assessing publ
ic harm when determining whether to initiate a PSPS event. The corrective actions involve the Utility’s processes, reporting, andother aspects of its PSPS program. On July 7, 2021, the Ac
ton Town Council filed an application to rehear the decision. Responses to the application for rehearingwere filed on July 22, 2021.
Integrated Resource Planning Procurement
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that tak
es a number of steps to address the potential for system RA shortages beginning in 2021. The decisionrequires increment
al procurement of system-level qualifying RA capacity of 3,300 MWs by all LSEs operating within the CAISO’s balancing area for the period2021-2023, of which the Utility is respons
ible for 716.9 MWs for its bundled customer portion. The decision requires that at least 50% of LSE resourceresponsibilities come on
line by August 1, 2021, at least 75% by August 1, 2022, and the remaining by August 1, 2023. Additionally, the decision directs the IOUsto act as the backstop procu
rement agent for CCAs and energy service providers that choose not to voluntarily self-procure or that fail to meet their procurementresponsibilities aft
er electing to self-provide their assigned MWs of system RA capacity under the decision.The Utility procured its r
equired RA capacity for the August 1, 2021 milestone from third parties through CPUC-approved contracts for lithium-ion battery energystorage resources with te
rms ranging from 10-15 years. On December 22, 2020, the Utility filed an advice letter seeking CPUC approval of an additional group ofsimilar contracts 
that would satisfy the balance of the Utility’s procurement obligations for the August 1, 2022 and August 1, 2023 milestones. On April 15, 2021,the CPUC approved the contracts.
90

On June 24, 2021, the CPUC adopted a mid-term reliability decision to address incremental electric system reliability needs between 2024 and 2026 due to, in part,the pending retiremen
ts of Diablo Canyon and once-through-cooling natural gas plants in Southern California by requiring at least 11,500 MW of additional netqualifying capacity to b
e procured by LSEs subject to the CPUC’s integrated resource planning authority. The decision sets procurement requirements of 2,000MW by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW by 2024, an addi
tional 1,500 MW by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW by 2026. The decision sets the Utility’s share ofthe procurement at 2,302 MW o
f incremental net qualifying capacity.On January 21, 2022, the Utility filed 
an advice letter with the CPUC seeking approval of a group of nine long-term RA agreements to meet a portion of itsprocurement require
ments under the CPUC’s mid-term reliability decision. The agreements are each for a term of 15 years and collectively supply 1,598.7 MW oflithium-ion energy stor
age capacity with some projects expected to be operational in 2023 and others in 2024.OIR to Further Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework for Electric and Gas Utili
tiesOn July 20, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking p
roceeding to consider ways to strengthen the risk-based decision-making framework that energy utilities useto assess, manage, miti
gate and minimize safety risks.On November 4, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision adop
ting 32 safety and operational metrics, which can serve as triggering events in the EOEP andrequiring the Utility to 
report on performance against these metrics on a semi-annual basis. The Utility is required to submit the first report by March 31, 2022. TheUtility will propose
 one- and five-year targets for each metric in such report.OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs
On August 17, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking pro
ceeding to develop a successor to the existing NEM tariffs. The successor tariff is being developedpursuant to the requirem
ents of AB 327. Under AB 327, the successor to the existing NEM tariffs should provide customer-generators with credit or compensationfor electricity generated by their
 renewable facilities based on the value of that generation to all customers and allow customer-sited renewable generation to growsustainably among differ
ent types of customers.On December 13, 2021, the CPUC issued a PD that would reduce the 
compensation for new non-CARE NEM customers by about 80 percent for standalone solarand about 60 percent for sola
r-paired storage. Commercial customer NEM compensation would be reduced by about 35 percent. Additionally, the PD wouldreduce the legacy per
iod for existing non-CARE NEM customers from 20 years to 15 years after which such customers would transition to the successor tariff.Comments and reply comments on 
the PD were filed in January 2022. The PD has not yet been scheduled to be voted on by the CPUC.OIR to Address Energy Utility Customer Debt Accumulated during the COVID-19 Pandemic
On February 11, 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulem
aking proceeding to consider arrearage relief for utility customers with outstanding utility bills when themoratorium on service d
isconnections ended. The OIR will evaluate a more global program beyond the currently approved arrearage management program focusedon low-income residentia
l customers that is funded by the Utility’s customers. The OIR may consider various funding approaches for this expanded debtforgiveness proposal, which could in
clude shareholder funding.On June 30, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision dire
cting the Utility and other IOUs to automatically enroll residential customers and small business customersmore than 60 days in arrea
rs in payment plans. The decision also extended the moratorium on service disconnections for residential and small business, as well asmedium and large comm
ercial and industrial customers, through September 30, 2021.On November 19, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision authoriz
ing IOUs to allocate payments made on past-due electric utility bills proportionally between utilitiesand CCAs through September 2024.
Self-Reports to the CPUC
The Utility self-repor
ts certain errors and omissions to the CPUC. The Utility could face penalties, enforcement actions, or other adverse legal or regulatoryconsequences for these er
rors or omissions, including under the EOEP. The Utility is unable to predict the likelihood and the amount of potential fines or penalties,if any, related to thes
e matters.91

Electric Asset InspectionsThe Utility has notified th
e CPUC of various errors relating to inspections and maintenance of its electric assets or implementation of WMP initiatives. Thesenotices include missed insp
ections or the inability to locate records evidencing performance of inspections required under CPUC GOs 95 and 165 (including failureto perform inspections in 
compliance with GO 165 of approximately 55,000 poles in 2020) and errors regarding reporting meeting targets set by the Utility’s 2020WMP. In these notices, the Util
ity describes the failures and corrective actions the Utility is taking to remediate these issues and to prevent recurrence in the future.Among other corrective mea
sures, the Utility has developed short-term and longer-term systemic corrective actions to address these errors, including performingenhanced inspections for pol
es with outdated or incomplete GO 165 inspection records and strengthening the Utility’s asset registry, as well as corrective actionsregarding reporting on the p
rogress toward WMP targets.The Utility continues to eva
luate whether there are additional failures to comply with GOs 95 and 165 and the 2020 WMP, beyond those identified in submittedself-reports. The Utili
ty intends to update the CPUC upon completion of its reviews.On November 21, 2021, the SED issued two citations to th
e Utility in relation to the Utility’s self-reports. One citation was for incomplete inspections performedon distribution poles as requi
red under GO 165, and the other citation was for the Utility’s failure to adequately inspect a transmission line. The citations resulted inpenalties of $2.5 million 
and $5 million, respectively, which the Utility paid in full on December 22, 2021.Subsurface Electric Ducts
On October 21, 2021, the Utility notifi
ed the CPUC of inconsistent application of the requirements to locate and mark empty subsurface electric ducts inaccordance with Government Code s
ection 4216(k), 4216(s) and 4216.3(a)(1)(A).LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY IN
ITIATIVESAssembly Bill 242
Assembly Bill 242, which was signed into law on Septe
mber 23, 2021, expanded the definition of a “covered wildfire” from AB 1054 to also include thosewildfires determined by 
a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by an electrical corporation, and those wildfires asserted to have been caused by an electricalcorporation that result in
 a court-approved dismissal resulting from the settlement of third-party damage claims.Assembly Bill 135
On July 16, 2021, the California governor app
roved AB 135, which established the CAPP. CAPP enables the IOUs to apply for a statewide total of approximately$695 million to offset custo
mer arrearages incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility received approximately $300 million in January 2022 to reducethe amounts owed by customer ac
counts in arrears. The amount of funding was determined by the California Department of Community Services andDevelopment, which is the agency 
responsible for administering the CAPP.Vaccine Mandates
On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an EO th
at would require certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors,including mandatory employ
ee vaccination. The requirements under the EO is currently stayed pending the outcome of ongoing litigation. The ultimateimplementation of th
e EO could result in workplace disruptions, employee attrition, and difficulty securing future labor needs.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility’s personnel and 
the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardouswastes; the reporting and r
eduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety andreliability measu
res for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors,“Environmental Regulation
” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIESPG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourageunauthorized risk-taking, 
reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e.,risk mitigation) and not 
for speculative purposes.Commodity Price Risk
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas andnuclear fuel necessary for electricit
y generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use ofphysical and financial 
instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can concludethat it is probable that it
s reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and naturalgas prices do not affect 
earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customersare also fully recoverable thr
ough a ratemaking mechanism.The Utility’s current au
thorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.The Utility recovers thes
e costs in its GRC through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts, resulting in price and volumetricrisk. The Utility uses value-
at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk was approximately $5 million and $14 million atDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectiv
ely. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for further discussion of price riskmanagement activities.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest rates. At Dece
mber 31, 2021 and 2020, if interest rates changed by one percent for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash invest
ments, the pre-tax impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $76 million and $89 million, respectively, based on netvariable rate debt 
and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for furtherdiscussion of interest ra
tes.Energy Procurement Credit Risk
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas and related services, including the CAISO market,other California IOUs, municip
al utilities, energy trading companies, pipelines, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gasproduction companies loca
ted in the United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas andrelated services, then the 
Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices or seek alternate services, which may be higher than thecontract prices.
The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, creditratings, and other credit
 criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contractsunder master commodity ena
bling agreements that may require security. Security may be in the form of cash or letters of credit. The Utility may accept other formsof performance assurance in
 the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility).Security or performance as
surance may be required from the Utility or counterparties when current net receivables/payables and exposure exceed contractuallyspecified limits.

ity plus collateral posted by the Utility and held by the counterparties. For purposes of this table, parental guarantees arenot included as part of the calculation. Exposure amounts reported above do not include adjust
ments for time value or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recordedamounts of assets and liabi
lities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Theaccounting policies desc
ribed below are considered to be critical accounting estimates due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant andmaterial to the f
inancial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgmentsand estimates. Actual res
ults may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting estimates and their key characteristics are outlinedbelow.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund
The Wildfire Fund is expect
ed to be capitalized with (i) $10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resourcescharge to customers, (i
i) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs, and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid byCalifornia’s three l
arge electric IOUs for a 10-year period. The contributions from the IOUs will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they willnot be permitted to re
cover these costs through rates. The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the IOUs pursuant to a “Wildfire Fundallocation metri
c” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable IOU’s service territory classified as HFTDs and adjusted to account for risk mitigationefforts. The Utility’s W
ildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions ofapproximately $193 mill
ion).On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and firstannual contribution of approx
imately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. The other large electric IOUs made theirinitial contributions 
to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. On December 30, 2020 and 2021, the Utility made its second and third annual contributions of$193 million each to the W
ildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have seven remaining annual contributions of $193 million(based on the current Wi
ldfire Fund allocation metric). PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for the contributions to the Wildfire Fund similarly to prepaidinsurance with expense being a
llocated to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage.As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $1.1 billion in Other non-current liabilities,$461 million in current ass
ets - Wildfire fund asset, and $5.3 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During theyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, th
e Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $517 million and $413 million, respectively. Theamortization of the asset, accreti
on of the liability, and acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income. Expe
cted contributions recorded in Wildfire Fund asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discounted to the present value using the 10-year U.S. treasury rate at 
the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund. A useful life of 15years is being used to amort
ize the Wildfire Fund asset. (1) (1) 
94

AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating theperiod of coverage, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data fromwildfires caused by elec
trical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data and theeffectiveness of mitigation effort
s by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These assumptions alongwith the other assumptions below c
reate a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation creates annualdistributions of potentia
l losses due to fires that could be attributed to the participating electric utilities. Starting with a five-year period of historical data, withaverage annual statewid
e claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion, compared to approximately $2.9 billion for the 12-year historical data, would havedecreased the amort
ization period to six years. As of December 31, 2021, a 10% change to the assumption around current and future mitigation effort effectivenesswould increase the amort
ization period by three years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease the amortization period by two years assuming lesseffectiveness.
Other assumptions 
used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by other electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claimswould be settled, the likely 
adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and determination of any amounts required to be reimbursed to theWildfire Fund, the impac
ts of climate change, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, andthe future transmission 
and distribution equity rate base growth of other electric utilities. Significant changes in any of these estimates could materially impact theamortization period.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility eva
luate all assumptions quarterly and upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and theexpected life of the 
Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of claimsthat a participat
ing utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset foracceleration of the amortization of
 the asset in the event that a participating utility’s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophicwildfire. Timing of an
y such acceleration of the amortization of the asset could lag as the emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take manyquarters and could be
 limited to public disclosure of the participating electric utility, if ignition were to occur outside the Utility’s service territory. There were firesin the Utility’s and other p
articipating utilities’ services territories since July 12, 2019, including fires for which the cause is currently unknown, which may in thefuture be determined 
to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $150 million in Other noncurrentassets for Wildfire Fun
d receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire and $43 million of accelerated amortization, reflected in Wildfire Fund expense.For more information, see 
“Initial and Annual Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054” in Note 3 and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054”in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in Item 8.Loss Contingencies
As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, andenvironmental remediation liabilities
. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.Wildfire-Related Liabilities
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability whenthey determine that 
a loss is probable and they can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless anamount within the range is a b
etter estimate than any other amount.95

Potential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including negotiations and settlements or the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires(including alternat
ive potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of suchstructures and other person
al property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of anypersonal injuries, includ
ing the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utilitymay be responsible for if 
found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number of unknownfacts and legal consideratio
ns that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted againstPG&E Corporation or the Utility. For exa
mple, the Utility’s wildfire-related accruals have changed in the past as new facts and information became available to theUtility, including the ava
ilability of new evidence and additional information about the scope and nature of damages.The process for estimatin
g wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including the f
actors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  See Note 14 of the Notesto the Consolidated Financial St
atements in Item 8.Enforcement and Litigation Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims andlawsuits. In addition, penalt
ies may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record aprovision for a loss contingency when 
it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluat
e the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is abetter estimate 
than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,often involves a series of 
complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of allknown information, such as negotia
tions, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to aparticular matt
er. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actualresults may differ m
aterially from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 14 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, through rates, and from the Wildfire Fund.The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable fora recovery when it is deem
ed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur and they can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The assessment ofwhether recovery is probabl
e or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgmentsabout future events.  Loss recov
eries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, including contractual liabilityinsurance policy coverag
e, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, conversations with the Wildfire Fund administrators, the CPUC and FERC,and other information and 
events pertaining to a particular matter. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.
Environmental Remediation Liabiliti
esThe Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to payfor environmental re
mediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling,or disposal of potentially h
azardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.96

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
 (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperationwith regulatory agencies. For 
example, the Utility has a program related to certain former MGP sites.) Based on such notification, the Utility completes anassessment of the potenti
al site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records an environmental remediationliability when site assess
ments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses. Given the complexities of thelegal and regulatory envir
onment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediationliabilities is subje
ctive and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substancesat a potential site, 
the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties,and the extent to which such costs 
are recoverable from third parties.When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending onthe level of informa
tion available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a si
gnificant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenance
 activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.Remediation efforts fo
r a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process maychange, as well as site condi
tions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Utility
’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion each. The Utility’s undiscounted futurecosts could increase to
 as much as $2.2 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentiallyresponsible parties are n
ot financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatoryrequirements. Although the Uti
lity has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may varysignificantly from a
ctual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.Regulatory Accounting
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despitethe ongoing losses related to wi
ldfires (see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.), there is no actual or anticipated change in thecost of service regula
tion of the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated Operations . These amounts would otherwise be recorded to exp
ense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 3 as well as Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatorybalancing accounts rec
eivable) of $12.7 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $13.8 billion.Determining probability 
requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatoryhearings, proposed regulatory d
ecisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of theUtility’s regulatory asset
s, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from theCPUC. The Utility also records a regula
tory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery ofincurred costs is probable, su
ch as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt. If th
e Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceasedto be subject to rate r
egulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accountingdid not apply, the Utility’s fu
ture financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing ofexpense or revenue recogni
tion.97

A portion of the Utility's regulatory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting fromcatastrophic events, ch
anges in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in amemorandum account and th
e CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudentlyincurred. These accounts, which 
include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to trackthe costs associated with work r
elated to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. In addition, the CPPMA and RUBA accountstrack costs incurred to 
implement the CPUC’s Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer Protections to SupportCalifornia Customers During the COVID-19 Pandem
ic. While the Utility generally believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorizationin separate proceedings o
r through a GRC. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the Wildfire ExpenseMemorandum Account” and “Regula
tory Matters - Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications” above.Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanis
m for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-relatedcosts found to be just and reasonab
le by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. The Utility mustevaluate the likelihood of
 recovery in future rates each period. If the criteria are met at a later date, the Utility would recognize a regulatory asset and a related gainin the consolidated incom
e statement in the period in which it is determined that the likelihood of recovery is probable.In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemakingpurposes and if a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regardingprobability of recovery, 
as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expectedto exceed the amount to be 
recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included inthird-party contracts, hist
orical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors. Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ac
count for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valueand its settlement da
te can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived ass
et. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recoveredthrough the ratemaking pro
cess. See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.To estimate its liab
ility, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and the e
stimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the riskassociated with the decom
missioning obligation.At December 31, 2021, the Utility’s 
recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $5.3 billion. Changes in theseestimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefi
t PlansPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non
-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement healthcare and medical plans for eli
gible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees andretirees. Adjustments to 
the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amountsare deferred in ac
cumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expenserecognized in accordan
ce with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable ofrecovery through rates. To th
e extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. See Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.98

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarialassumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health carecost trend rate and the 
expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes oramendments, or significant
 changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future planexpenses. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consol
idated Financial Statements in Item 8.In establishing health c
are cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluationsuggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the designof PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed h
ealth care cost trend rate for 2022 was 6.0%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in2028 and beyond.
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit p
lan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based onreal maturity and c
redit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and realearnings growth added to a long-t
erm inflation rate. For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 5.5% compares to a ten-year actual returnof 9.6%.
The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 817 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 2021. This yield cu
rve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pensionand other postretirem
ent benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.The following reflects th

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PR
ESENTATIONOrganization and Basis of Presentation
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia. The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility is primarily regulated by theCPUC and the FERC. In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, cons
truction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utilityand its wholly owned and controlled subsid
iaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on aconsolidated basis (i.e., th
e companies operate in one segment).The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form10-K. The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,liabilities, revenu
es and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to theUtility’s regulatory asset
s and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation liabilities,AROs, wildfire-related rec
eivables, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptionsreflected in the Consolid
ated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in anadjustment that would have a 
material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows duringthe period in which such change oc
curred.NOTE 2: BANKRUPTCY FILING
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility commenced the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Prior to the Emergence Date, PG&ECorporation and the Utility con
tinued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with theapplicable provisions of th
e Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.On June 20, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered th
e Confirmation Order confirming the Plan filed on June 19, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility emergedfrom Chapter 11 on the Emergen
ce Date of July 1, 2020.Except as otherwise set for
th in the Plan, the Confirmation Order or another order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition liabilities were dischargedunder the Plan.
Unresolved Chapter 11 Claims
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
received over 100,000 proofs of claim since the Petition Date, of which approximately 80,000 were channeled to a trust forthe benefit of holders of 
certain subrogation claims (the “Subrogation Wildfire Trust”) and Fire Victim Trust. The claims channeled to the Subrogation WildfireTrust and Fire Victim Trust wil
l be resolved by such trusts, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility have no further liability in connection with such claims. PG&ECorporation and the
 Utility continue their review and analysis of certain remaining claims, including asserted litigation claims, trade creditor claims, along withother tax and regulatory 
claims, and therefore the ultimate liability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for such claims may differ from the amounts asserted insuch claims. Allowed claims 
are paid in accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order. Amounts expected to be allowed are reflected as current liabilitiesin the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts.114

Holders of certain claims may assert that they are entitled under the Plan or the Bankruptcy Code to pursue, or continue to pursue, their claims against PG&ECorporation and the Utility on or 
after the Emergence Date, including claims arising from or relating to indemnification or contribution claims, including withrespect to the wildfir
e that began on November 8, 2018 near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Camp fire”), the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires, and the wildfir
e that began September 9, 2015 in Amador and Calaveras counties in Northern California (the “2015 Butte fire”).In addition, Subordinated Debt Clai
ms and HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims (each as defined in Note 14 below) continue to be pursued against PG&ECorporation and the Utility in 
the claims reconciliation process in the Bankruptcy Court, and claims against certain former directors and current and formerofficers, as well as ce
rtain underwriters, are being pursued in the purported securities class action that is further described in Note 14 under the heading “SecuritiesClass Action Litigation.”
In addition to filing obje
ctions in the Bankruptcy Court to claims with respect to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe they have liability, PG&ECorporation and the Utility a
re working to resolve certain disputed general unsecured claims before a panel of mediators. On November 4, 2021, the BankruptcyCourt entered an order ext
ending the deadline for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to object to claims to June 21, 2022, except for a claim filed by the CaliforniaDepartment of Water Resou
rces, for which the Bankruptcy Court set an objection deadline of March 23, 2022.Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s 2001 prior proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energysupplied to the Utility’s cus
tomers between May 2000 and June 2001. While the FERC and judicial proceedings were pending, the Utility pursued settlements withelectricity suppliers and entere
d into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and recover onthe Utility’s refund cl
aims against these electricity suppliers. After the Utility received $145 million from the California Power Exchange and various escrows thatwere established as part o
f the disputed claims settlements in December 2021, the Utility filed at the Bankruptcy Court to close out its 2001 bankruptcy case. OnDecember 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court gr
anted the motion for entry of final decree and closed the 2001 bankruptcy case. As of December 31, 2021, theConsolidated Balance Sheets re
flected $0 in net claims within Disputed claims and customer refunds compared to $242 million as of December 31, 2020. TheUtility expects to refund 
current regulatory liabilities of $422 million, reflected in Current liabilities – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, $145 million ofwhich would be funded from the amounts 
received from the California Power Exchange and various escrows discussed above.Reorganization Items, Net
Reorganization items, ne

TING POLICIESRegulation and Regulated Operations
The Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenuerequirements through ra
tes is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assetsand liabilities tha
t result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes andrecords, as regulatory ass
ets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered through future rates. Regulatory assets are amo
rtized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently beingrecovered through rates, 
the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded tocustomers in the future 
are also recorded as regulatory liabilities.The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of recovery or r
efund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customerbillings or authorized r
evenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have noimpact on net income.  See 
“Revenue Recognition” below.Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To theextent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated atfair value.  As of December 31, 2020, 
the Utility also held restricted cash that primarily consisted of cash held in escrow to be used to pay bankruptcy relatedprofessional fees.

Revenue RecognitionRevenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes r
evenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Ratescharged to customers ar
e based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because ofseasonality, weather, and cus
tomer usage patterns.Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRCs, which occur every four years.  The Utility's ability to recover revenue requirementsauthorized by the CPUC in these rate 
cases is independent or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility's sales of electricity and natural gas services. The Utilityrecognizes revenues that 
have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24months.  Generally, elect
ric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year. The Utility records a balancing account asset or liability fordifferences between cus
tomer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.The Utility also collec
ts additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, including costs topurchase electric
ity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, the revenue recognitioncriteria for pass-
through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability fordifferences between in
curred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable ofrecovery or refund. As a resul
t, these differences have no impact on net income.The following table presents

Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost – Credit LossesPG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility use the current expected credit loss model to estimate the expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets measured at amortizedcost. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
evaluate credit risk in their portfolio of financial assets quarterly. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and theUtility have identified the
 following significant categories of financial assets.Trade Receivables
Trade receivables a
re represented by customer accounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record an allowance for doubtful accounts to recognize an estimate ofexpected lifetime credit losses.
 The allowance is determined on a collective basis based on the historical amounts written-off and an assessment of customercollectability. Furthermore, ec
onomic conditions are evaluated as part of the estimate of expected lifetime credit losses using an analysis of regional unemploymentrates.
As of December 31, 2021, the allowance 
also included the estimated impact of the CAPP which offers financial assistance from the State of California for eligiblecustomers in the form of 
a credit to the customer’s bill. The Utility recorded a reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $207 million inthe fourth quarter of 2021 as 
a result of the expected CAPP funding, which was received on January 27, 2022.As of December 31, 2021, the Utility r
ecorded $209 million of long-term accounts receivables as a result of the CPUC’s June 30, 2021 final decision on bill debtrelief which offers financial a
ssistance for eligible customers in the form of a 24-month payment plan.As of December 31, 2021, expected cr
edit losses of $154 million were recorded in Operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Incomefor credit losses associ
ated with trade and other receivables. The portion of expected credit losses that are deemed probable of recovery are deferred to the RUBA,CPPMA and a FERC regulatory asset. At December 31, 2021, the RUBA current b
alancing accounts receivable balance was $127 million, and CPPMA and FERClong-term regulatory 
asset balances were $30 million and $12 million, respectively.Other Receivables and Available-For-Sale Debt Se
curitiesInsurance receivables are related t
o the liability insurance policies PG&E Corporation and the Utility carry. Insurance receivable risk is related to each insurancecarrier’s risk of de
faulting on their individual policies. Wildfire fund receivables are the funds available from the statewide fund established under AB 1054 forpayment of eligible c
laims related to the 2021 Dixie fire that exceed $1.0 billion and available insurance coverage. For more information, see Note 14 below.Wildfire fund rece
ivables risk is related to the Wildfire Fund’s durability, which is a measurement of the claim-paying capacity. Lastly, PG&E Corporation and theUtility are required to determi
ne if the fair value is below the amortized cost basis for its available-for-sale debt securities. An impairment may exist if there is anintent to sell or a requ
irement to sell before recovery of the amortized basis. If such an impairment exists, then PG&E Corporation and the Utility must determinewhether a portion of the imp
airment is a result of expected credit loss.As of December 31
, 2021, expected credit losses for insurance receivables, Wildfire Fund receivables, and available-for-sale debt securities were immaterial.Inventories
Inventories are car
ried at weighted-average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground isrecorded to inventory when inj
ected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materialsand supplies are recorded 
to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.Emission Allowances
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations. Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.118

Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor andmaterials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  See “AFUDC” below.  The Utility’s estimated service lives of its property, plant, and equipment were as follows:

it is used based on the amount of energyoutput. See Note 15 below.
 Includes $850 million of fire risk mitigation-related property, plant, and equipmen
t securitized in accordance with AB 1054. See Note 5 below. The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment balance 
in a particular class of property, with the exception of its securitized property, plant and equipment, which is depreciated over the life ofthe bond and a pattern consist
ent with principal payments.  This method approximates the straight-line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,plant, and equipment.  The Util
ity’s composite depreciation rates were 3.82% in 2021, 3.76% in 2020, and 3.80% in 2019.  The useful lives of the Utility’sproperty, plant, and equipmen
t are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers. Depreciation expense inc
ludes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value atretirement.  Upon reti
rement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs andmaintenance, including pla
nned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs o
f debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and iscapitalized as par
t of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service. AFUDC related to the cost of debt is re
corded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  The Utilityrecorded AFUDC related to debt and equi
ty, respectively, of $56 million and $133 million during 2021, $35 million and $140 million during 2020, and $55 millionand $79 million during 2019.

The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement dateor range of potential se
ttlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirementactivities associated with 
substations, certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment fromleased property; and res
toration of land to the conditions under certain agreements.Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding.  In December 2021, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning cost estimate to the CPUC andcorrespondingly decreased 
its ARO liabilities by $1.4 billion. The adjustment was a result of a decrease in estimated costs based on refinements to the site-specificdecommissioning analysis. The d
ecommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility's nuclear power plants. Actual decommissioning costs 
may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements;technology; and costs of labor, 
materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs through rates through a non-bypassable charge that th
e Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.The total nuclear deco
mmissioning obligation accrued was $3.9 billion and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The estimated undiscountednuclear decommissioning 
cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $7.6 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Disallowance of Plant Costs
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts
The Utility’s nuclear gen
eration facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires thesafe removal of a nuclear ge
neration facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license andrelease of the proper
ty for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered through rates and are held in trusts until authorized forrelease by the CPUC. 
The Utility classifies 
its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assetsare managed by externa
l investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses areconsidered other-than-temporar
y impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, fromcustomers through rates.  The
refore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact onthe Utility’s earnings or 
accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiaryand is required to consolida
te the VIE.  120

Consolidated VIEsReceivables Securitiza
tion ProgramThe SPV created in connection with th
e Receivables Securitization Program (as defined below in Note 5 below) in October 2020 is a bankruptcy remote, limitedliability company wholly owned by th
e Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the ReceivablesSecuritization Program, t
he Utility sells certain of its receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations of the Utility with respect to suchreceivables, and cer
tain other related rights to the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables from financial institutions (the “Lenders”).Amounts received from the L
enders, the pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included in Accounts receivable, Other noncurrent assets, and Long-term debt, respectiv
ely, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of the loans made by the Lenders cannotexceed $1.0 billion outstanding 
at any time. On September 15, 2021, the Receivables Securitization Program was amended and extended to September 15, 2023.The SPV is considered a VIE because its equ
ity capitalization is insufficient to support its activities. The most significant activities that impact the economicperformance of the SPV are de
cisions made to manage receivables. The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPV as it makes thesedecisions. No additional finan
cial support was provided to the SPV during the year ended December 31, 2021 or is expected to be provided in the future that wasnot previously contractua
lly required. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the SPV had net accounts receivable of $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, andoutstanding borrowings of $974 million 
and $1.0 billion, respectively, under the Receivables Securitization Program.AB 1054 Securitization
PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, 
limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&ECorporation or the Utility. Pursuan
t to the Financing Order for AB 1054, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the non-bypassable wildfire hardeningfixed recovery charge 
(“Recovery Property”) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued recovery bonds secured by the Recovery Property. OnNovember 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximat
ely $860 million of senior secured recovery bonds. The recovery bonds were issued in threetranches: (1) approxim
ately $266 million with an interest rate of 1.46% and is due July 15, 2033, (2) approximately $160 million with an interest rate of 2.28% andis due January 15, 2038, and (3) approxim
ately $434 million with an interest rate of 2.82% and is due July 15, 2048. The recovery bonds are scheduled to payprincipal and interes
t semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The final scheduled payment date is July 15, 2046. Amounts owed to bond-holders areincluded in Long-term debt 
and Long-term debt, classified as current, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because 
its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant activities thatimpact the economic p
erformance of PG&E Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the Recovery Property. The Utility is considered theprimary beneficia
ry and consolidates PG&E Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer. No additional financial support was provided to PG&ERecovery Funding LLC during the year ended Dec
ember 31, 2021 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required. As ofDecember 31, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC has outstanding bor
rowings of $860 million.Non-Consolidated VIEs
Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that wouldgenerate electr
icity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2021, it assessedwhether it absorbs any of the VIE’s 
expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchaseagreement, analyzed 
the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are mostsignificant to the VIE’s pe
rformance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amountthe Utility pays for deliv
ered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are mostsignificant to the econo
mic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2021, it didnot consolidate any of them.

Initial and Annual Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054The Wildfire Fund is expect
ed to be capitalized with (i) $10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resourcescharge to customers, (i
i) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid byCalifornia’s three l
arge electric IOUs for a 10-year period. The contributions from the IOUs will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they willnot be permitted to re
cover these costs through rates. The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the IOUs pursuant to a “Wildfire Fundallocation metri
c” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable IOU’s service territory classified as HFTDs and adjusted to account for risk mitigationefforts. The Utility’s W
ildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions ofapproximately $193 mill
ion).On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and firstannual contribution of approx
imately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. San Diego Gas & Electric Company andSouthern California Edison made 
their initial contributions to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. On December 30, 2020 and 2021, the Utility made its secondand third annual contribut
ions of $193 million each to the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have seven remainingannual contributions of $193 mi
llion (based on the current Wildfire Fund allocation metric). PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for the contributions to theWildfire Fund similar
ly to prepaid insurance with expense being allocated to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage.As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $1.1 billion in Other non-current liabilities,$461 million in current ass
ets - Wildfire fund asset, and $5.3 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As ofDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, th
e Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $517 million and $413 million, respectively. Theamortization of the asset, accreti
on of the liability, and acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income. Expe
cted contributions recorded in Wildfire Fund asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discounted to the present value using the 10-year U.S. treasury rate at 
the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund. A useful life of 15years is being used to amort
ize the Wildfire Fund asset.AB 1054 did not specify a period of cover
age; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating theperiod of coverage, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data fromwildfires caused by elec
trical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data and theeffectiveness of mitigation effort
s by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These assumptions alongwith the other assumptions below c
reate a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation creates annualdistributions of pote
ntial losses due to fires that could be attributed to the participating electric utilities. Starting with a five -year period of historical data, withaverage annual statewid
e claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion, compared to approximately $2.9 billion for the 12-year historical data, would havedecreased the amort
ization period to six years. As of December 31, 2021, a 10% change to the assumption around current and future mitigation effort effectivenesswould increase the amort
ization period by three years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease the amortization period by two years assuming lesseffectiveness.
Other assumptions 
used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by other electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claimswould be settled, the likely 
adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and determination of any amounts required to be reimbursed to theWildfire Fund, the impac
ts of climate change, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, andthe future transmission 
and distribution equity rate base growth of other electric utilities. Significant changes in any of these estimates could materially impact theamortization period.
122

PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate all assumptions quarterly, and upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and theexpected life of the 
Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California, and the amount of claimsthat a participat
ing utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset foracceleration of the amortization of
 the asset in the event that a participating utility’s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophicwildfire. Timing of an
y such acceleration of the amortization of the asset could lag as the emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take manyquarters and could be
 limited to public disclosure of the participating electric utility, if ignition were to occur outside the Utility’s service territory. There were firesin the Utility’s and other p
articipating utilities’ services territories since July 12, 2019, including fires for which the cause is currently unknown, which may in thefuture be determined 
to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $150 million in Other noncurrentassets for Wildfire Fun
d receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire and $43 million of accelerated amortization, reflected in Wildfire Fund expense.Other Accounting Policies

Recognition of Lease Assets and LiabilitiesA lease exists when an arrange
ment allows the lessee to control the use of an identified asset for a stated period in exchange for payments. This determination ismade at inception of th
e arrangement. All leases must be recognized as a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet of the lessee. The ROU asset reflectsthe lessee’s right to use 
the underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability reflects the obligation to make the lease payments. PG&E Corporation and theUtility have elected no
t to separate lease and non-lease components.The Utility estimates 
the ROU assets and lease liabilities at net present value using its incremental secured borrowing rates, unless the implicit discount rate in theleasing arrangement can be a
scertained. The incremental secured borrowing rate is based on observed market data and other information available at the leasecommencement date. Th
e ROU assets and lease liabilities only include the fixed lease payments for arrangements with terms greater than 12 months. Theseamounts are presented with
in the supplemental disclosures of noncash activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Renewal and termination optionsonly impact the lease 
term if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. PG&E Corporation recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm. The Utility recogn
izes lease expense in conformity with ratemaking.Operating leases are in
cluded in operating lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financingleases are included in p
roperty, plant, and equipment, other current liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing leaseswere immaterial 
for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.For the years ended December 31, 2021 
and 2020, the Utility made total cash payments, including fixed and variable, of $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively,for operating leases which 
are presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The fixed cash payments for the principalportion of the financing l
ease liabilities are immaterial and continue to be included within financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Anyvariable lease paym
ents for financing leases are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The majority of the Util
ity’s ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to various power purchase agreements. These power purchase agreements primarily consist ofgeneration plants leas
ed to meet customer demand plus applicable reserve margins. Operating lease variable costs include amounts from renewable energy powerpurchase agreements wher
e payments are based on certain contingent external factors such as wind, hydro, solar, biogas, and biomass power generation. See“Third-Party Power Purchase Agreem
ents” in Note 15 below. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities related toproperty and land arrange
ments.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Utility
’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.04 years and 5.7 years and a weighted averagediscount rate of 6.1% and 6.2%, r
espectively.The following table shows the leas

$ 1,277  Sale of Transmission Tower Wireless Licenses
On February 16, 2021, the Utility granted 
to a subsidiary of SBA Communications Corporation (such subsidiary, “SBA”) an exclusive license enabling SBA tosublicense and market 
wireless communications equipment attachment locations (“Cell Sites”) on more than 700 of the Utility’s electric transmission towers,telecommunications towers,
 monopoles, buildings or other structures (collectively, the “Effective Date Towers”) to wireless telecommunication carriers(“Carriers”) for attachment of 
wireless communications equipment, as contemplated by a Master Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) datedFebruary 2, 2021, between the Utility 
and SBA. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Utility also assigned to SBA license agreements between the Utilityand Carriers for substanti
ally all of the existing Cell Sites on the Effective Date Towers.The exclusive license was gr
anted pursuant to a Master Multi-Site License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) between the Utility and SBA. The term of theLicense Agreement is for 100 y
ears. The Utility has the right to terminate the license for individual Cell Sites for certain regulatory or utility operational reasons,with a corresponding payment to SBA. Pursuant to 
the License Agreement, SBA is entitled to the sublicensing revenue generated by new sublicenses of Cell Siteson the Effective Date Towers, sub
ject to the Utility’s right to a percentage of such sublicensing revenue.The Utility and SBA also entered into 
a Master Transmission Tower Site License Agreement (the “Tower Site Agreement”), pursuant to which SBA received theexclusive rights to sublic
ense and market additional attachment locations on up to 28,000 of the Utility’s other electric transmission towers to Carriers forattachment of wirel
ess communications equipment. The Tower Site Agreement provides for a split of license fees from Carriers between the Utility and SBA. TheTower Site Agreement has a li
censing period of up to 15 years, depending on SBA’s achievement of certain performance metrics, and any sites licensed duringsuch licensing period will con
tinue to be subject to the Tower Site Agreement for the same term as the License Agreement.In addition, the Utility and SBA ente
red into a Pipeline Cell Site Transaction Agreement pursuant to which the Utility and SBA established terms and conditionsfor adding additional ce
ll sites under the License Agreement. Pipeline Cell Sites are locations where the Utility was in the process of locating a new Cell Site for awireless carrier at the close 
of the transaction.In exchange for the exclus
ive license and entry into the License Agreement, SBA paid the Utility $946 million of the purchase price at the closing. On August 15,2021, the post-closing period ended, 
and the final purchase price was $947 million, pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement.The Utility recorded approx
imately $370 million of the $947 million sales proceeds as a financing obligation, as this portion of the proceeds for existing Cell Sitesrepresents a sale of fu
ture revenues. The Utility recorded approximately $106 million of the $947 million sales proceeds as a contract liability (deferred revenue),as a portion of proceeds with r
espect to the sublicensing of Cell Sites, as well as the Tower Site Agreement, represents an upfront payment for access to space onthe Utility’s assets. The Uti
lity utilized a third-party discounted cash flow model based on business assumptions and estimates to determine the allocation of thepurchase price between th
e financing obligation and deferred revenue. The financing obligation and deferred revenue are included in Other noncurrent liabilities onthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Utility recorded the 
remaining approximately $471 million ($455 million of which was noncurrent) of the sale proceeds to regulatory liabilities, for the portionthat is probable to be re
turned to customers in accordance with existing revenue sharing practices.125

The financing obligation is amortized through Electric operating revenue and Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income using the effectiveinterest method and the 
deferred revenue balance is amortized through Electric operating revenue ratably over the 100-year term.Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which amends the existing guidance to reduce compl
exity relating to Income Tax disclosures. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021. There was no materialimpact on PG&E Corporation’s or the Ut
ility’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related disclosures resulting from the adoption of this ASU.Government Assistance
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance
 (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Enti ties about Government Assistance, which increases the transp
arency of government assistance including the disclosure of (1) the types of assistance, (2) an entity’s accounting for the assistance, and(3) the effect of th
e assistance on an entity’s financial statements. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2021. There was nomaterial impac

In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E 
Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s 2001 proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUCauthorized the Utility to recover $1.2 billion of costs related to the Ut
ility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of these regulatory assets are being amortized over therespective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent wi
th the period over which the related revenues are recognized. Includes costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorit
ies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020,$49 million in COVID-19 related costs was recorded to CEMA regulatory assets. Recovery of CEMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.

At the Market Equity Distribution Program
On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equ
ity Distribution Agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc., BofASecurities, Inc., Credit Suisse Se
curities (USA) LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents and as forward sellers (in such capacities as applicable, the“Agents” and the “Forward Sellers,
” respectively), and Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse Capital LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, NationalAssociation, as forward purchase
rs (the “Forward Purchasers”), establishing an at the market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation,through the Agents, may offer and s
ell from time to time shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400 million.PG&E Corporation has no obligation to off
er or sell any of its common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend offers underthe Equity Distribution Agreem
ent.The Equity Distribution Agreemen
t provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the Agents,PG&E Corporation may enter into fo
rward sale agreements (collectively, the “Forward Sale Agreements”) pursuant to which the relevant Forward Purchaser willborrow shares from third par
ties and, through its affiliated Forward Seller, offer a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of commonstock underlying the parti
cular Forward Sale Agreement.(1)(1) (1) 
134

During the year ended December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation did not sell any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement or any Forward SaleAgreement. As of December 31, 2021, the
re was $400 million available under PG&E Corporation’s at the market equity distribution program for future offerings.Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
Under Section 382 of the Interna
l Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit PG&E Corporation or the Utility’s ability to use these DTAs to offset taxableincome). In general, an owne
rship change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certainlook-through and aggregation ru
les) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally threeyears). The Amended Articles 
limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons)ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity secu
rities to 4.75% or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approvalby the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporat
ion.On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and th
e Fire Victim Trust entered into an agreement (the “Share Exchange and Tax MattersAgreement”), pursuant to which PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility made a “grantor trust” election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inceptionof the Fire Victim Trust. As a r
esult of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held bythe Utility and, in turn at
tributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust, along with any sharesowned by the Utility directly, 
are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage StockOwnership (as defined in the Amended Ar
ticles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by ShareCo are alsoeffectively exclud
ed because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had 2,463,891,104 sharesoutstanding as of February 4, 2022, only 1,548,403,924 shar
es (that is, the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held by theFire Victim Trust, the Util
ity and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based on the totalnumber of outstanding equity se
curities and assuming the Fire Victim Trust has not sold any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, a person’s effectivePercentage Stock Ownership limi
tation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of February 4, 2022 was 2.98% of the outstanding shares. As of December 31,2021, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fir
e Victim Trust had not sold any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. On January 31, 2022, the FireVictim Trust initiat
ed an exchange of 40,000,000 Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and TaxMatters Agreement and announ
ced that it had entered into a transaction for the sale of these shares.As of the date of this report, 
it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and consequently, its net operating losscarryforwards and other t
ax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement
In accordance with the Shar
e Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, the grantor trust election has been filed.With the grantor trust 
election, the Utility’s tax deductions occur as and when the Fire Victim Trust pays the fire victims rather than when the Utility transferredcash and other property (in
cluding PG&E Corporation common stock) to the Fire Victim Trust. For PG&E Corporation common stock transferred to the FireVictim Trust, the amount of 
the tax deduction will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time suchshares were transferr
ed to the Fire Victim Trust.135

Under the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, the parties agreed to exchange the 477,743,590 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock issued to theFire Victim Trust pursuant to 
the Plan (the “Plan Shares”) for an equal number of newly-issued shares of PG&E Corporation common stock (the “New Shares”).Accordingly, on July 9, 2021, PG&E Corporation issued 477,743,590 New Shares to Sha
reCo, which has the sole purpose of holding the New Shares in adesignated brokerage ac
count to facilitate the exchange process. When the Fire Victim Trust desires to sell any or all of its Plan Shares, the Fire Victim Trust mayexchange any number of Plan Shares 
for a corresponding number of New Shares on a share-for-share basis (without any further consideration payable by eitherparty) and thereaft
er promptly dispose of the New Shares in one or more transactions with one or more third parties. In the event that the Fire Victim Trust isunable to timely dispose of New Shar
es under certain circumstances (such shares, the “Nonconforming New Shares”), PG&E Corporation has authorized up to250,000,000 additional shares of PG&E Corporat
ion common stock, which may be transferred by ShareCo to the Fire Victim Trust on behalf of the Utility, inexchange for the Nonconforming New Shar
es, following the same procedures as for an exchange of Plan Shares for New Shares. The Plan Shares and any Non-Conforming New Shares exchanged will be he
ld thereafter by the Utility. In the event that the Fire Victim Trust disposes of any share of PG&E Corporation’scommon stock subject to the Sha
re Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement without complying with the terms of the agreement, the Fire Victim Trust may berequired to make a paym
ent to the Utility designed to compensate the Utility for adverse tax consequences arising from nonconforming sale transactions.Upon PG&E Corporation’s issuance of the New Shares to Sha
reCo, PG&E Corporation’s common stock increased by $4.85 billion, the fair value of the shares onJuly 9, 2021. The increase to common s
tock is fully offset by the fair value of treasury stock recorded. The issuance of the New Shares did not have an impact onthe total number of outst
anding common shares as the New Shares are currently held by ShareCo and as such, there was no impact on basic or diluted EPS for theyear ended December 31, 2021.
When the Fire Victim Trust no
tifies the Utility that it intends to sell shares, ShareCo (on behalf of the Utility) will transfer the New Shares to the Fire Victim Trust,and the Fire Victim Trust wil
l transfer the Plan Shares to the Utility. The Utility has no plan or intention to dispose of the Plan Shares at any time. As shares areexchanged with the Fire Victi
m Trust, the Utility will record the cost of shares and PG&E Corporation’s investment under additional paid in capital and PG&ECorporation’s common stock and t
reasury stock will decrease by the fair value per share established on July 9, 2021.As of December 31, 2021, none of the 250,000,000 rese
rved shares had been issued.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.On March 20, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a Case Resolution Contingency Process Motion with the Bankruptcy Court that includes a dividendrestriction for PG&E Corporat
ion. According to the dividend restriction, PG&E Corporation “will not pay common dividends until it has recognized $6.2 billion innon-GAAP core earnings following the Effe
ctive Date” of the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court entered the order approving the motion on April 9, 2020.In addition, the Corporation Revolv
ing Credit Agreement requires that PG&E Corporation (1) maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidatedcapitalization of no g
reater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) if revolving loans are outstanding as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio ofadjusted cash to fixed cha
rges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% prior to the date that PG&E Corporation first declares a cash dividend on itscommon stock and at least 100
% thereafter.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid.  As of January 31, 2022, th
ere were $59.1 million of such cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. Additionally, theCPUC requires the Utility to maint
ain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in theChapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among oth
er things, grants the Utility a temporary, five -year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure forthe financing in place upon 
the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.  136

Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, resul
ts of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of Directorsmay deem relevant. On Februa
ry 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’spreferred stock as of Janu
ary 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, payable on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 and declared a dividend on theUtility’s preferred s
tock totaling $3.5 million that will be accrued during the three-month period ending April 30, 2022, payable on May 15, 2022, to holders ofrecord on April 29, 2022. It is uncer
tain when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on their common stock.Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP permits various forms o
f share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other share-based awards,to eligible employees o
f PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receive certain share-basedawards.  A maximum of 91 million sh
ares of PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuance under the LTIP, ofwhich 58,552,722 shares were availabl
e for future awards at December 31, 2021.The following table provides a su

Stock Options
The exercise price of s
tock options granted under the LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’s commonstock on the date of grant.  Stock op
tions generally have a 10-year term and vest over three years of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting in certaincircumstances. As of Decemb
er 31, 2021, there were no unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options for PG&E Corporation.The fair value of each s
tock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method. No stock options were granted in 2021 and 2020.  Expected volatiliti
es are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date ofgrant.  The risk-free in
terest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant.  Theexpected life of stock o
ptions is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.There was no tax benefit re
cognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2021.137

Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units gran
ted after 2014 generally vest equally over three years. Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation commonstock accompanied by cash pay
ments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generallyrecognized ratably ove
r the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2021,2020, and 2019 was $11.01, $9.25, and $18.57, respectively.  The to
tal fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $19 million,$31 million, and $42 million, r
espectively.  The tax detriment from restricted stock units that vested in 2021 was $11 million.  In general, forfeitures are recordedratably over the vesting p
eriod, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2021, $81 million of total unrecognizedcompensation costs rela
ted to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 2.19 years.The following table summar

NOTE 7: PREFERRED STOCK
PG&E Corporation has authorized 400 mi
llion shares of preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.The Utility has authorized 75 
million shares of first preferred stock, with a par value of $25 per share, and 10 million shares of $100 first preferred stock, with a parvalue of $100 per share.  At Decemb
er 31, 2021 and 2020, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with interest rates between 5%and 6% designated as nonredee

ely.  The Utility’s preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption. No shares of $100 first preferred stock areoutstanding.
On December 31, 2021, annual dividends on the Ut
ility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferredstock is subject to redemp
tion at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividendsthrough the redemption dat
e.  At December 31, 2021, annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share.Dividends on all Utility pref
erred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights. Upon liquidation or dissolution of th
e Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaiddividends, as specified for 
the class and series. On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaiddividends on the Utility’s pre
ferred stock as of January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, payable on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 anddeclared a dividend on the Ut

NOTE 8: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calcula

NOTE 9: INCOME TAXESPG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferredincome taxes resulting 
from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating DTAs andliabilities.  DTAs and liabi
lities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expense.PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will besustained upon examination by t
axing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measuredbased on the largest amount o
f benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken orexpected to be taken in a 
tax return in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents anunrecognized tax benefit. 
Investment tax credits are deferre
d and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period.  The
 Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under whichthe Utility determin
es its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis. The significant components o

 Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the
deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impac
ted as thesedifferences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that 
these amounts will be recovered from orreturned to customers in future rates.  In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of
the Tax Act passed in December 2017.
The Utility includes an adjustment for a DTA write-off associated with the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust 
in 2021 and an adjustment for the DTA write-off for differencebetween the liability recorded related to the TCC RSA and the ul
timate value of PG&E Corporation stock contributed to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020. PG&E Corporation includes the sameadjustment as the Utility in 2021 and 2020 as well as a permanent non-deduct
ible equity backstop premium expense in 2020. This combined with a pre-tax loss and a pre-tax income forPG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively in 2020, accounts for the remaining difference.
 These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settle
ments and non-tax deductible penalty costs in  2021 and 2020.Unrecognized Tax Benefits

t the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards. PG&E Corporationwill continue to monitor th
e status of tax carryforwards.Other Tax Matters
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits are not likely to change significantly within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2021, it isreasonably possible that with
in the next 12 months, unrecognized tax benefits will decrease. The amount is not expected to be material.As of the date of this report, 
it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating losscarryforwards and other t
ax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.In March 2020, Congress passed, and the Presid
ent signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. Under the CARES Act,PG&E Corporation and the Utility have d
eferred the payment of 2020 payroll taxes for the remainder of the year to 2021 and 2022. Half of the payment was paidin 2021.
During June 2020, the State of Californ
ia enacted AB 85, which increases taxes on corporations over a three-year period beginning in 2020 by suspension of thenet operating loss deduction 
and a limit of $5 million per year on business tax credits. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not anticipate any material impacts toPG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financia
l Statements due to this legislation.143

Additionally, as a result of the grantor trust election, the Utility’s tax deductions occur when the Fire Victim Trust pays the fire victims, rather than when theUtility transferred 
cash and other property (including PG&E Corporation common stock) to the Fire Victim Trust. Therefore, $5.4 billion of cash and $4.54 billionof PG&E Corporation common stock, in the 
aggregate $10.0 billion, that were transferred to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020, will not be deductible for tax purposesby the Utility until the Fir
e Victim Trust pays the fire victims. Furthermore, the activities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for taxpurposes. PG&E Corporation’s net operat
ing loss has decreased by approximately $10.0 billion, which will be offset by payments made by the Fire Victim Trust tothe fire victims (whi
ch totaled approximately $1.67 billion in 2021) and the net activities of the Fire Victim Trust to date. Additionally, there was a $1.3 billioncharge, net of tax, decr
easing net DTAs for the payment made to the Fire Victim Trust in PG&E Corporation common stock on its Consolidated FinancialStatements for activ
ity through December 31, 2020. PG&E Corporation will recognize income tax benefits and the corresponding DTA as the Fire Victim Trustsells shares of PG&E Corporation com
mon stock, and the amounts of such benefits and assets will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells theshares, rather than the p
rice at the time such shares were transferred to the Fire Victim Trust. As of December 31, 2021, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation,the Fire Victim Trust had not so
ld any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, resulting in no tax impact in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sconsolidated financia
l statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. On January 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust initiated an exchange of 40,000,000 PlanShares for an equal number of New Shar
es in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement and announced that it had entered intoa transaction for the s
ale of these shares. For more information, see Note 6 above.NOTE 10: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered through rates.The Utility uses both derivat
ive and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices. Derivatives includecontracts, such as power purchas
e agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.Derivatives are presen
ted in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangementsfor each counterparty. Th
e fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention tooffset exist.
Price risk management activities
 that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments are notheld for speculative purpos
es and are subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Utility expects to fully recover through rates all costs related to derivativesunder the applicable ratemakin
g mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.Therefore, all unrea
lized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatoryassets and liabiliti
es on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost ofnatural gas with corresponding 
increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.The Utility elects the n
ormal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives. Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These items 
are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. 144

 agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. Multiple credit agencies continue to rate the Utility belowinvestment grade, which resu
lts in the Utility posting additional collateral. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility satisfied or has otherwise addressed its obligationsrelated to the credit-risk related c
ontingency features.NOTE 11: FAIR VALUE 
MEASUREMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets, and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair valuehierarchy is establish
ed that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:•
Level 1 – Observable inputs  that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.(1)(2) (3)
(1) 
(2)
(3)
145

•Level 2 – Other inputs that are  directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are support ed by little or no market activities.The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.Assets and liabilities m
easured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are heldby PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions onthe terms and conditions upon which 
the investments may be redeemed. There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31,2021 and 2020.
Trust Assets
Assets Measured at Fair Value
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. Nuclear decommissioning trust assetsand other trust assets ar
e composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are money market funds valued atLevel 1.
Global equity securities p
rimarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. (1) 
(2)(1)
(2)
147

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified asLevel 2 using evaluated pri
cing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Exped
ientInvestments in the nucle
ar decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedienthave not been classified 
in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amountspresented in the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchangesas well as fixed-income s
ecurities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities and asset-backed securities.Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, andCRRs that are traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter. Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable marketforward prices for the unde
rlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or arevalued using forward prices f
rom broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued usingobservable market data and
 market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3. These Level 3 contracts are valued usingeither estimated b
asis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond aperiod for which market da
ta is available.  The Utility utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricinginputs from brokers and histor
ical data.The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.Level 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis
Inputs used and the fair valu
e of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related toLevel 3 instruments are e
xpected to be recoverable through rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of theseinstruments.  See Note 10 above.

cost trend rate as of December 31, 2021 was 6.0%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in 2028 andbeyond. 
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit p
lan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based onreal maturity and c
redit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and realearnings growth added to a long-t
erm inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 5.5% compares to a ten-year actual return of 9.6%.  The rate usedto discount pension benefits and o
ther benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 817 Aa-grade non-callable bonds atDecember 31, 2021.  This yield curve h
as discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefitsand other benefit obliga
tions were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.Investment Policies and Strategies
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefitobligations.  Volatility in 
funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financialreporting, as well as the a
mount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of fundedstatus volatility. 
The trusts’ asset alloc
ations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes alsoinfluence liabili
ty valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significantallocations in long matu
rity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-termfunding costs due to their highe
r expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-incomeinvestments by exhibiting r
eturns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include global real estate investment trusts (“REITS”), globallisted infrastructu
re equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios. Derivative instruments su
ch as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasuryfutures, are also used to r
ebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion ofthe non U.S. dollar exposure of global equ
ity investments.154

ised primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable. Valuation Techniques
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that arevalued using a NAV per share can be red
eemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.155

Short-Term InvestmentsShort-term investments 
consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.
Global Equity Securities
The global equity category 
includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on publicexchanges and are there
fore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identicalsecurities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.Real Assets
The real asset catego
ry includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodityfutures, global REITS, and global lis
ted infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets. Fixed-Income Securities
Fixed-income securiti
es are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the trusts 
that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tablesabove. The fair value amoun
ts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Theseinvestments include com
mingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges, fixed-income securities that are composed primarily ofU.S. government securities, cr
edit securities and asset-backed securities, and real assets and absolute return investments that are held to diversify the trust’sholdings in equity and fixed-in
come securities.Transfers Between Levels

Employer Contributions
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
ributed $335 million to the pension benefit plans and $10 million to the other benefit plans in 2021.  These contributions areconsistent with PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicableregulatory decisions and f
ederal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirementrequiring a cash contribu
tion in 2021.  The Utility’s pension benefits met all the funding requirements under Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp
ect to make total contributions of approximately $327 million and $15 million to the pension plan and other postretirement benefitplans, respectively, for 2022. 
Benefits Payments and Receipts
As of December 31, 2021, the estima
ted benefits expected to be paid and the estimated federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the next five fiscalyears, and in aggregate
 for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (in millions)

There were no material differences between the estimated benefits expected to be paid by PG&E Corporation and paid by the Utility for the years presented above. There were also no mater
ial differences between the estimated subsidies expected to be received by PG&E Corporation and received by the Utility for the yearspresented above.
Retirement Savings Plan
PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirem
ent savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code 1986, asamended.  This plan permits 
eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provide for employer contributions to be made toeligible particip
ants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were$133 million, $119 million, and $109 m
illion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporation changed its default matchingcontributions under its 401(k) p
lan from PG&E Corporation common stock to cash. Beginning in March 2019, at PG&E Corporation’s directive, the 401(k) plantrustee began purchasing new sha
res in the PG&E Corporation common stock fund on the open market rather than directly from PG&E Corporation.There were no materia
l differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.NOTE 13: RELATED PARTY A
GREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONSThe Utility and other subsidia
ries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility andPG&E Corporation exchange administ
rative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility arepriced at the higher of 
fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of theservices.  Services provided d
irectly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending onthe nature and value of th
e services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries usingagreed-upon allocation 
factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies. Management believes that the
 methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.The Utility’s significan

NOTE 14: WILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIESLiability Overview
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a losscontingency is recorded when i
t is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluate 
which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their bestestimate or the lower 
end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or arange of losses is estimab
le, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates areadjusted to reflect 
the impact of all known information, such as negotiations (including those during mediations with claimants), discovery, settlements andpayments, rulings, advice of 
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision forloss and expense excludes anti
cipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows may be 
materially affected by the outcome of the following matters.The process for estimat
ing losses associated with potential claims related to wildfires requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number ofassumptions and s
ubjective factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience withwildfires. As more i
nformation becomes available, including from potential claimants as litigation or resolution efforts progress, management estimates andassumptions regarding the pot
ential financial impacts of wildfire events may change.Potential liabilit
ies related to wildfires depend on various factors, including the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire (including alternative potentialorigins, weather- and cli
mate-related issues, and forest management and fire suppression practices), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed,the contents of such structu
res and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the natureand extent of any personal in
juries, including the loss of lives, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible forif found negligent, and the a
mount of any penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities.Criminal charges have be
en filed against the Utility in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. Under California law (including Penal Codesection 1202.4), if the Utili
ty were convicted of any of the charges, the sentencing court must order the Utility to “make restitution to the victim or victims in anamount established by
 court order” that is “sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of” theUtility’s underlying conduct, 
in addition to interest and the victim’s or victims’ attorneys’ fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is notwaivable by either the gove
rnment or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers.If convicted of any of the 
charges, the Utility could be subject to fines, penalties, and restitution to victims for their economic losses (including property damage,medical and mental h
ealth expenses, lost wages, lost profits, attorneys’ fees and interest), as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements. In theevent that the Utility we
re convicted of certain charges in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire or 2020 Zogg fire, the Utility currently believes that, depending onwhich charges it were to be conv
icted of, its total losses associated with such fire would materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities that PG&E Corporationand the Utility have reco
rded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. The Utility is currently unable to determine areasonable estimat
e of the amount of such additional losses. The Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitutionpayments ordered by the cour
ts presiding over the criminal proceedings.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e aware of numerous civil complaints related to the following wildfire events and expect that they may receive further suchcomplaints. The complain
ts include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violations of the Public UtilitiesCode, violations of the Health & Sa
fety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance and private nuisance. The plaintiffs in each action principally assert thatPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect, and de-energize their transmission lines was the cause of the relevant wildfire.The timing and outcome for 
resolution of any such claims or investigations are uncertain. The Utility believes it will continue to receive additional informationfrom potential cla
imants in connection with these wildfire events as litigation or resolution efforts progress. Any such additional information may potentially allowPG&E Corporation and the Utility to r
efine the estimates of their accrued losses and may result in changes to the accrual depending on the information received.PG&E Corporation and the Utility int
end to vigorously defend themselves against both criminal charges and civil complaints.159

If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are judicially determined to be the substantial cause of the following matters, andthe doctrine of inverse 
condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without havingbeen found negligent. Californ
ia courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders againstutilities on the grounds tha
t losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community thatbenefited from such under
taking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs through rates. Further, California courts havedetermined that the do
ctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs.The CPUC may decide not to authorize cos
t recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrineof inverse condemnation. In 
addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees under inverse condemnation, PG&ECorporation and the Utility cou
ld be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages and otherdamages under other theor
ies of liability in connection with the following wildfire events, including if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were found to have beennegligent.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cur
rently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater than the accrued estimated amounts butare unable to reasonably 
estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because, as described above, there are a number of unknown facts and legalconsiderations that may 
impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporationand the Utility and the outco
me of the criminal proceedings initiated against the Utility. If the liability for wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate inany Coverage Year, the Utility 
may be eligible to make a claim to the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated eligible claims inexcess of such amount, except 
that claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to the 40% limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising beforeemergence from bankrup
tcy. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and other information as it becomesavailable, including ev
idence in the possession of Cal Fire or the relevant district attorney’s office, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yetbeen submitted, and addition
al information about the nature and extent of personal and business property damages and losses, the nature, number and severity ofpersonal injuries, and info
rmation made available through the discovery process.2019 Kincade Fire
According to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at 
approximately 9:27 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the“2019 Kincade fire”), loc
ated in the service territory of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update dated March 3, 2020, 3:35 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2019Kincade fire consumed 77,758 ac
res and resulted in no fatalities, four first responder injuries, 374 structures destroyed, and 60 structures damaged. In connectionwith the 2019 Kincade fire, sta
te and local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings. Based on County of Sonomainformation, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation order or an evacuation warningbetween October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 inc
luded approximately 200,000 persons.On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press rele
ase with its determination that the Utility’s equipment caused the 2019 Kincade fire.On April 6, 2021, the Sonoma County District Attorney
’s office filed the Kincade Complaint charging the Utility with five felonies and 28 misdemeanors related tothe 2019 Kincade fire. On April 6, 2021, PG&E Corporat
ion announced that it disputed the charges in the Kincade Complaint. It further announced that it wouldaccept Cal Fire’s finding 
that a Utility transmission line caused the 2019 Kincade fire. On May 11, 2021, the Utility filed a demurrer to 25 of the 33 countscontained in the Kincade Compl
aint. At a hearing on September 9, 2021, the Sonoma County Superior Court overruled the demurrer. The Utility pled not guilty toall charges on October 13, 2021. On January 28, 2022, 
the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office filed the Kincade Amended Complaint, which replaces twofelonies with five diff
erent felonies and drops six misdemeanor counts. On January 28, 2022, the court deemed the Utility’s demurrer and the court’s prior ruling asapplying to 22 of the 30 counts in the Kin
cade Amended Complaint, and the Utility thereafter pled not guilty to all charges in the Kincade Amended Complaint. Apreliminary hearing on 
the charges began on February 8, 2022.160

On December 2, 2021, the CPUC approved a settlement between the Safety Enforcement Division and the Utility (the “Kincade SED Settlement”). The KincadeSED Settlement resolves SED’s investig
ation into the 2019 Kincade fire and provides for the removal of approximately 70 transmission lines or portions of linesthat are no longer in serv
ice and are de-energized but have not been removed as required by CPUC rules. The Kincade SED Settlement provides that (i) the Utilitywill pay $40 million to Califo
rnia’s General Fund; (ii) the Utility will remove permanently abandoned transmission lines over a ten-year period; and (iii) the Utilitymust incur $85 million of th
e costs of such work by December 31, 2024, and it may not seek recovery of this $85 million of costs. SED agreed to refrain frominstituting enforcem
ent proceedings against the Utility for not having removed the lines previously. The Kincade SED Settlement states that it does not constitutean admission by the Utility of v
iolations of GOs or statutory requirements. In connection with the Kincade SED Settlement, PG&E Corporation and the Utilityrecorded a liabili
ty of $40 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2021. For the$85 million of cost of remov
al that the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record such disallowances in 2022. On January 10, 2022, TURN filedan application for reh
earing of the Kincade SED Settlement. On January 25, 2022, the Utility filed an opposition to the application for rehearing.As of February 3, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of approximately 100 complaints on behalf of at least 2,605 plaintiffs related to the 2019Kincade fire. The plaint
iffs filed master complaints on July 16, 2021; PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s response was filed on August 16, 2021; and PG&ECorporation and the Utility f
iled a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer.In addition, on January 5, 2022, Cal Fire f
iled a complaint in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately $90 million for fire suppression andother costs incurred in conn
ection with the 2019 Kincade fire. Following a November 5, 2021 hearing, the San Francisco County Superior Court set a trial date ofNovember 7, 2022.
Based on the current state o
f the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utilityas of the date of this fi
ling, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sinvestigation, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. PG&E Corporation andthe Utility recorded a 
liability in the aggregate amount of $625 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (before available insurance). Based on the facts andcircumstances avai
lable to the Utility as of the filing of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,2021, including the status of negot
iations with certain subrogation entities, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in 2021 for potentiallosses in connection with the 2019 Kinc

2020 Zogg FireAccording to Cal Fire, on September 27, 2020, 
at approximately 4:03 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane,north of Igo in Shasta County, Californi
a (the “2020 Zogg fire”), located in the service territory of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update datedOctober 16, 2020, 3:08 p.m. Pacific Tim
e, the 2020 Zogg fire consumed 56,338 acres and resulted in four fatalities, one injury, 204 structures destroyed, and 27structures damaged.
On March 22, 2021, Cal Fire issued a press re
lease with its determination that the 2020 Zogg fire was caused by a pine tree contacting electrical facilities ownedand operated by the Utility 
located north of the community of Igo.On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County Distric
t Attorney’s Office filed the Zogg Complaint charging the Utility with 11 felonies and 20 misdemeanors relatedto the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2020 Daniel 
fire, the 2020 Ponder fire, and the 2021 Woody fire. On September 24, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility announcedthat they disputed the cha
rges in the Zogg Complaint. They further announced that they would accept Cal Fire’s finding that a Utility electric line caused the 2020Zogg fire, even though PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility did not have access to all of the evidence that Cal Fire gathered. On November 18, 2021, the Utility fileda demurrer to 10 of the 31 coun
ts contained in the Zogg Complaint. A hearing on the demurrer is set for April 4, 2022.Various other entities, which 
may include other law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertain when any such investigations will becomplete.
As of February 3, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of approximately 21 complaints on behalf of at least 382 plaintiffs related to the 2020 Zoggfire. The plaintiffs s
eek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and otherdamages. The plaintiffs 
filed master complaints on August 6, 2021, and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s answer was filed on September 7, 2021, and PG&ECorporation and the Utility f
iled a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer.At an October 4, 2021 hearing, the San Franc
isco County Superior Court set a trial date of February 6, 2023. In addition, PG&E Corporation and the Utility havebeen contacted by Cal Fire to 
accept service of a complaint filed against them for fire suppression costs incurred in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.Based on the current state o
f the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utilityas of the date of this fi
ling, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sinvestigation, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. PG&E Corporation and theUtility recorded a li
ability in the aggregate amount of $275 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (before available insurance). Based on the facts andcircumstances avai
lable to the Utility as of the filing of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the status ofnegotiations with certa
in agencies, subrogation entities, and individual plaintiffs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in 2021 forpotential losses in connec
tion with the 2020 Zogg fire in the amount of $100 million, for an aggregate liability of $375 million (before available insurance).Following continued negotiations dur
ing the quarter ended December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered agreements with all but one of theinsurance subrogation plain
tiffs in the 2020 Zogg fire litigation to resolve their claims arising from the 2020 Zogg fire.The Utility’s accrued es
timated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed bycourts or other government
al entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federalor state agencies othe
r than state fire suppression costs, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.162

$ 211  The Utility has liabili
ty insurance for third-party liability attributable to the 2020 Zogg fire in an aggregate amount of $611 million. This amount is reduced fromthe $867.5 million of coverag
e disclosed in the 2020 Form 10-K due to the Utility’s commuting certain insurance policies in connection with its April 2021wildfire liability 
insurance renewal. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility has recorded an insurance receivable for $337 million for probable insurance recoveriesin connection with the 2020 Zogg fir
e, which equals the $375 million probable loss estimate less an initial self-insured retention of $60 million, plus $22 million inlegal fees incurred. Re
covery under the Utility’s insurance policies for the 2021 Dixie fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds available for the 2020Zogg fire by the same amount.
2021 Dixie Fire
According to Cal Fire, on July 13, 2021, at approx
imately 5:15 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the Feather River Canyon near Cresta Dam (the “2021 Dixiefire”), located in 
the service territory of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update, dated October 25, 2021, 7:46 a.m. Pacific Time, the 2021 Dixie fireconsumed 963,309 acres and result
ed in 1,329 structures destroyed (including 717 residential, 143 commercial, and 443 other structures), 95 structures damaged,and one fatality, which ac
cording to published reports was a fire fighter who passed away due to COVID-19 after returning home from the 2021 Dixie fire.On January 4, 2022, Cal Fire issued a press re
lease with its determination that the 2021 Dixie fire was caused by a tree contacting electrical distribution linesowned and operated by the Utility.
The Butte County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Lassen County and Teha
ma County District Attorneys’ Offices, as well as the SED and OEIS, are investigatingthe fire; various other entitie
s, which may include other state and federal law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. The United StatesAttorney’s Office for the E
astern District of California issued a subpoena for documents as well. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with theinvestigations. It is unce
rtain when any such investigations will be complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into thecause of the 2021 Dixie fire. Th
is investigation is ongoing, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have access to all of the evidence in the possession of CalFire or other third part
ies.As of February 3, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of approximately 20 complaints on behalf of at least 1,005 plaintiffs related to the 2021 Dixiefire and expect that 
they may receive further such complaints. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages,exemplary damages, attorney
s’ fees and other damages.Based on the current state o
f the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utilityas of the date of this fi
ling, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sinvestigation, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and theUtility recorded a li
ability in the aggregate amount of $1.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 (before available recoveries).The Utility’s accrued es
timated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed bycourts or other government
al entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federalor state agencies inc
luding for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are notreasonably estimable.
163

As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs fromfederal, state, county, o
r local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and theUtility have not concluded th
at a loss is probable due to the incomplete information available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing as tofacts pertinent to pot
ential claims and defenses. Moreover, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possiblelosses for any such claims due 
to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that wouldbear on the amount, type, and va
luation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the2021 Dixie fire and corresponding 
magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to landand vegetation in nationa
l parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national park and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixiefire. According to the Nation
al Interagency Coordination Center Incident Management Situation Report dated October 29, 2021 at 7:30 a.m. Mountain Time, over$630 million of costs had been in
curred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility currently estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres ofnational parks and approxim
ately 685,000 acres of national forests.The Utility has liabili
ty insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to periods in which both the 2020 Zogg fire and 2021 Dixie fire occurred in anaggregate amount of $900 mi
llion. Recovery under the Utility’s insurance policies for the 2020 Zogg fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds availablefor the 2021 Dixie fire by the s
ame amount. An immaterial decrease was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility has recordedan insurance receivab
le of $563 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, which equals the aggregate $900 million ofavailable insurance 
coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2021 Dixie fire, less the $337 million insurance receivable recorded in connection with the2020 Zogg fire.
As of December 31, 2021, the Utility has 
recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of $150 million for probable recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. See“Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below. The Util
ity has also recorded a $101 million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that weredetermined to be probabl
e of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a $347 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable ofrecovery through the WEMA. See “Regul
atory Recovery” below. Decreases in the amount of the insurance receivable for the 2021 Dixie fire may also increase theamount that is probable of 
recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and the WEMA. An immaterial increase was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, customers, and the Wildfire Fund. PG&ECorporation and the Utility r
ecord a receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur, and the Utility can reasonablyestimate the amount o
r its range. While the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of suchinsurance recoveries.

InsuranceInsurance Coverage
In April 2021, the Utility purchas
ed approximately $268 million in wildfire liability insurance coverage for the period from April 13, 2021 to April 1, 2022, andapproximately $32 mill
ion in incremental wildfire liability reinsurance for the period from April 1, 2021 to April 1, 2022 at a cost of approximately $220 million.This coverage is in addition 
to approximately $11 million in existing wildfire liability reinsurance for the period from July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021 andapproximately $600 mill
ion in existing wildfire liability insurance purchased by the Utility in August 2020 for the period from August 1, 2020 to August 1, 2021.On August 1, 2021, the $600 million of existing wild
fire liability coverage renewed on a 12-month term covering the period from August 1, 2021 to August 1,2022 at a cost of approximat
ely $516 million pursuant to multi-year policy terms. The Utility’s wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insuredretention of $60 million.
In June 2021, the Utility purchased 
approximately $535 million in non-wildfire liability coverage for the period from June 1, 2021 to April 1, 2022 at a cost ofapproximately $89 mill
ion. This coverage is in addition to approximately $140 million in existing non-wildfire liability insurance for the period from August 1,2020 to August 1, 2021. In connection with the June 2021 r
enewal, the Utility procured an extension of this existing coverage to April 1, 2022 at a premium cost ofapproximately $30 mill
ion. The Utility also has $50 million in additional non-wildfire liability coverage available through one of its wildfire liability policies withshared limits. The Utili
ty’s non-wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million. As of December 31, 2021, PG&ECorporation and the Utility had p
repaid insurance of $358 million, reflected in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Various coverage limit
ations applicable to different insurance layers could result in material uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type ofdamages resulting from 
covered events.In the Utility’s 2020 GRC proceeding, the CPUC also approv
ed a settlement agreement provision that allows the Utility to recover annual insurance costs for up to$1.4 billion in general li
ability insurance coverage. For more information about the RTBA, see Note 4 above.Insurance Receivable
Through December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility recorded $430 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire,$337 million for probable insu
rance recoveries in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, and $563 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and the Ut

Regulatory RecoveryFERC TO rates
The Utility recognizes in
come and reduces its regulatory liability for potential refund through the FERC TO formula rate in future rates for a portion of the third-party wildfire-rel
ated claims in excess of insurance coverage. The allocation to transmission customers was based on a FERC-approved allocation factor asdetermined in the for
mula rate. Based on information currently available to the Utility regarding the 2021 Dixie fire, for the year ended December 31, 2021, theUtility recorded a $101 mi
llion reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through theFERC TO formula rate.
WEMA
In June 2018, the CPUC approved the establishmen
t of the WEMA, which provides for tracking of incremental wildfire claims and outside legal costs plusincremental insuran
ce premium costs above what is being recovered through rates. For the year ended December 31, 2021, based on information currentlyavailable to the Util
ity, incremental wildfire claims-related costs for the 2021 Dixie fire were determined to be probable of recovery and the Utility recorded a $347million regulatory ass
et in the WEMA.Wildfire Fund under AB 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California governor sign
ed into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available foreligible electric utility companies t
o pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electricutility company’s equipm
ent, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Each of California’s large electric IOUs has elected to participate in the WildfireFund. Eligible claims are 
claims for third-party damages resulting from any such wildfires, limited to the portion of such claims that exceeds the greater of (i)$1.0 billion in the aggregat
e in any Coverage Year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to be in place for the electric utility company pursuant toSection 3293 of the Public Utilit
ies Code, added by AB 1054. The accrued Wildfire Fund receivable as of December 31, 2021 reflects an expectation that theCoverage Year will be based on the 
calendar year with coverage limited to the 2021 Dixie Fire. For 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected aCoverage Year that commen
ces on January 1, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time and ends on December 31, 2022 at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time.Electric utility 
companies that draw from the Wildfire Fund will only be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC in a proceeding for costrecovery applying the pruden
cy standard in AB 1054, not to be just and reasonable, subject to a disallowance cap equal to 20% of the IOU’s transmission anddistribution equity rat
e base. For the Utility, the disallowance cap would be approximately $2.9 billion based on its 2021 equity rate base, and is subject toadjustment based on changes in 
the Utility’s total transmission and distribution equity rate base and would apply for a three calendar year period. The disallowancecap is inapplicable in certain
 circumstances, including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions thatresulted in the applic
able wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain avalid safety certi
fication. Costs that the CPUC determines to be just and reasonable in accordance with the prudency standard in AB 1054 will not be reimbursed tothe Wildfire Fund, result
ing in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund. The Utility expects that the same prudency standard would also be applied in any CPUC reviewof an application fil
ed by the Utility seeking recovery of costs recorded to the WEMA.Before the expiration of 
any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification from the OEIS, which the Utility expects to be issuedwithin 90 days if the Utility has p
rovided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safety certification pursuant to Section 8389(e) of the PublicUtilities Code, added by AB 1054. An issued safety c
ertification is valid for 12 months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon,whichever occurs later. On Janu
ary 14, 2021, the OEIS (then the Wildfire Safety Division of the CPUC) approved the Utility’s 2020 application and issued theUtility’s 2020 safety cer
tification pursuant to the requirements of AB 1054. The safety certification is separate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and doesnot preclude the CPUC from pursuing rem
edies for safety or other applicable violations. On January 31, 2022, the OEIS approved the Utility’s 2021 applicationand issued the Utility’s 2021 saf
ety certification.The Wildfire Fund and disallowan
ce cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i)$10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds support
ed by a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resources charge to customers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initialcontributions from Califo
rnia’s three large electric IOUs and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large electric IOUs for a 10-yearperiod. For more informat
ion see “Initial and Annual Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054” in Note 3 above.166

The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could bedepleted more quickly tha
n expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. The Wildfire Fund isavailable to pay for th
e Utility’s eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019, the effective date of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the allowed amount of suchclaims arising between 
the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11. The 40% limit does not apply to eligible claims that arise afterthe Utility’s emergen
ce from Chapter 11.As of December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $150 million in Other noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021Dixie fire.

e LitigationTwo purported derivative lawsui
ts alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court onNovember 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respect
ively, naming as defendants certain then-current and former members of the boards of directors and certainthen-current and form
er officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are named as nominal defendants. These lawsuits wereconsolidated by the court on Febru
ary 14, 2018 and denominated In Re California North Bay Fire Derivati ve Litigation (now re-captioned Trotter v. Williams et al.
). On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. After the parties reached an agreement regarding a stay of the derivative proceeding pendingresolution of the tort a
ctions related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and any regulatory proceeding relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, onApril 24, 2018, the court entered 
a stipulation and order to stay. The stay was subject to certain conditions regarding the plaintiffs’ access to discovery in otheractions. On January 28, 2019, the plaint
iffs filed a request to lift the stay for the purposes of amending their complaint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Campfire. Prior to resolution o
f the plaintiffs’ request to lift the stay, this matter was automatically stayed by PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commencement ofthe Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s rights with respect to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s claims directly or indirectly related to anyof the Fires (as defined in 
the Plan) against former officers and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were assigned to the Fire Victim Trust under thePlan. Any such recovery is limit
ed to the extent of any director and officer insurance policy proceeds paid by any insurance carrier to reimburse PG&E Corporationor the Utility for amounts p
aid pursuant to their indemnification obligations in connection with such causes of action. The assignment became effective as of theEmergence Date. On November 12, 2020, the 
trustee for the Fire Victim Trust filed a motion to intervene to substitute as the plaintiff in the matter, to which theparties later stipu
lated. On March 8, 2021, the court granted the parties’ stipulation to substitute the trustee for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.On December 24, 2018, a separate de
rivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger v. Chew, et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Chew, et al. ), was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging cla
ims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fireagainst certain then
-current and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. On February 5, 2019, theplaintiff filed a 
response to the notice asserting that the automatic stay did not apply to his claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility accordingly filed a Motion toEnforce the Automatic Stay wi
th the Bankruptcy Court as to the Bowlinger action, which was granted. On November 5, 2020, th e court entered a stipulation andorder to substitute the t
rustee for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.On February 24, 2021, the trustee fil
ed an amended complaint in the Trotter v. Chew  action, asserting two cla ims for breach of fiduciary duty against certain ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
former directors and officers. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is a party to the action. On March 30, 2021, theTrotter v. Chew
 and Trotter v. Williams  actions were consolidated. On Apri l 26, 2021, the defendants filed demurrers to the amended complaint. On November 8,2021, the Court entered an order sus
taining in part and overruling in part the demurrers. On November 18, 2021, the trustee filed a second amended complaint. OnDecember 21, 2021, the defendants 
filed demurrers to the second amended complaint. Trial is set for June 27, 2022.On January 25, 2019, a separate purport
ed derivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg v. Chew, et al. , was filed in San Francisco Superior Cour t, alleging claims forbreach of fiduciary duty, 
abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain then-current and formerofficers and directo
rs, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. A stipulation and proposed order to voluntarily dismiss this actionwas filed on April 20, 2021 and a case m
anagement conference on the dismissal order is set for March 9, 2022.167

The above purported derivative lawsuits were brought against the named defendants on behalf of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. As a result of the assignment ofthese claims to the Fir
e Victim Trust, any recovery based on these claims would be paid to the Fire Victim Trust. Any such recovery is limited to the extent of anydirector and office
r insurance policy proceeds paid by any insurance carrier to reimburse PG&E Corporation or the Utility for amounts paid pursuant to theirindemnification oblig
ations in connection with such causes of action.Securities Class Action Litigation
Wildfire-Related Securiti
es Class ActionIn June 2018, two purported securiti
es class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”),naming PG&E Corporation and certa
in of its then-current and former officers as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al. and  Jon PaulMoretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al.
, respectively.  The compl aints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, vegetationmanagement and transm
ission line safety in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a)of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promu
lgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Both complaintsidentified a proposed cl
ass period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases, and the litigation is nowdenominated 
In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion, U.S. District Court for the Northern Dist rict of California, Case No. 18-03509. The court alsoappointed PERA as lead plaintiff. PERA fil
ed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. On December 14, 2018, PERA filed a second amendedconsolidated complaint 
to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, the proceedings were automatically stayed as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.On February 22, 2019, a third purported secu
rities class action was filed in the District Court, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retiremen t Fund,et al. v. Rambo, et al. 
(the “York County Action”). The compl aint names as defendants certain then-current and former officers and directors, as well as theunderwriters of four public o
fferings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is named as a defendant. The complaint allegesmaterial misrep
resentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetationmanagement and wildfir
e safety measures. The complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks unspecifiedmonetary relief, a
ttorneys’ fees and other costs, and injunctive relief. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action was consolidated with In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation.
On May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the 
consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims assertedin the previously filed a
ctions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain current and former officers and former directors, and theunderwriters. On August 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court den
ied PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s request to extend the stay to the claims against the officer,director, and underwrite
r defendants. On October 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint,which motions are under submission wi
th the District Court. The securities actions have been enjoined as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Planwith any such claims submitt
ed through a proof of claim to be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court as part of the claims reconciliation process in the Chapter 11Cases. On April 29, 2021, the District Court issued 
a notice of intent to stay this action pending completion of the claims procedures in the bankruptcy proceedings.PERA filed objections to the notic
e of intent to stay on May 28, 2021. PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a response to PERA’s objections on June 10, 2021,the officer, direc
tor, and underwriter defendants filed a response to PERA’s objections on June 11, 2021, and PERA filed a sur-response on June 21, 2021. TheDistrict Court has not taken fu
rther action with respect to its notice of intent to stay.168

Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt ClaimsClaims against PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility relating to, among others, the three purported securities class actions (described above) that have beenconsolidated and denominat
ed In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion, U.S. District Court for the Northern Dist rict of California, Case No. 18-03509, willbe resolved pursuant to the Plan. As des
cribed above, these claims consist of pre-petition claims under the federal securities laws related to, among other things,allegedly misleading statements
 or omissions with respect to vegetation management and wildfire safety disclosures, and are classified into separate categoriesunder the Plan, each of which is subj
ect to subordination under the Bankruptcy Code. The first category of claims consists of pre-petition claims arising from orrelated to the common s
tock of PG&E Corporation (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation, the “HoldCo Rescission or DamageClaims”). The second catego
ry of pre-petition claims, which comprises two separate classes under the Plan, consists of claims arising from debt securities issuedby PG&E Corporation and the Utility (such 
claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the “Subordinated Debt Claims,”and together with the HoldCo Rescission or Da
mage Claims, the “Subordinated Claims”).While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe they have defenses to the Subordinated Claims, as well as insurance coverage that may be available with respectto the Subordinated Claims, thes
e defenses may not prevail and any such insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the full amount of the allowed claims.In that case, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility will be required, pursuant to the Plan, to satisfy any such allowed claims as follows:•
each holder of an allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim will receive a number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation equal to suchholder’s HoldCo Rescission or Damage Clai
m Share (as such term is defined in the Plan); and•
each holder of an allowed Subordinated Debt Claim will receive payment in full in cash.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have b
een engaged in settlement efforts with respect to the Subordinated Claims. If the Subordinated Claims are not settled,PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct that the Subordinated Claims will be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court in the claims reconciliation process and treated asdescribed above under the Plan. Unde
r the Plan, after the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have the authority to compromise, settle, object to,or otherwise resolve proofs of 
claim, and the Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction to hear disputes arising in connection with disputed claims. With respect to theSubordinated Claims, the cla
ims reconciliation process may include litigation of the merits of such claims, including the filing of motions, fact discovery, andexpert discovery. The tota
l number and amount of allowed Subordinated Claims, if any, was not determined at the Emergence Date. To the extent any such claimsare allowed, the total 
amount of such claims could be material, and therefore could result in (a) the issuance of a material number of shares of common stock ofPG&E Corporation with respect to al
lowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, or (b) the payment of a material amount of cash with respect to allowedSubordinated Debt Claims. There c
an be no assurance that such claims will not have a material adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows.Further, if shares are issu
ed in respect of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust shouldreceive additional sh
ares of common stock of PG&E Corporation (assuming, for this purpose, that shares issued in respect of the HoldCo Rescission or DamageClaims were issued on the Emerg
ence Date).The named plaintiffs in 
the consolidated securities actions filed proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court on or before the bar date that reflect their securitieslitigation claims 
against PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PERA has filed two motions seeking approval from the Bankruptcy Court to treat its proof of claim asa class claim. On February 27, 2020 and J
anuary 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued orders denying the motions. PERA filed an appeal of the February 27,2020 order and on March 8, 2021, the Distri
ct Court issued an order dismissing the appeal.On July 2, 2020, PERA filed a notice of appeal of 
the Confirmation Order to the District Court, solely to the extent of seeking review of that part of theConfirmation Order approving th
e Insurance Deduction (as defined in the Plan) with respect to the formula for the determination of the HoldCo Rescission orDamage Claims Share. On August 10, 2021, the Distri
ct Court issued an order affirming the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling with respect to the Insurance Deduction. OnSeptember 9, 2021, PERA filed a notice of 
appeal of the District Court’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and on December 15, 2021, PERA filed itsopening brief. PERA’s appeal to the Ninth Ci
rcuit remains pending.169

On September 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion (the “Securities Claims Procedures Motion”) with the Bankruptcy Court to approveprocedures to help faci
litate the resolution of the Subordinated Claims. The motion, among other things, requested approval of procedures which would allowPG&E Corporation and the Utility to co
llect trading information with respect to the Subordinated Claims, to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process forresolving disputed Subordinated Cla
ims, and to file certain omnibus claim objections with respect to the Subordinated Claims. PERA and a number of other partiesfiled objections to the Se
curities Claims Procedures Motion. On January 25, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Securities Claims Procedures Motion.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have b
een working to resolve the Subordinated Claims in accordance with the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court,including by requesting trad
ing information from holders of Subordinated Claims. Also, pursuant to those procedures, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have filednumerous omnibus objections in th
e Bankruptcy Court to certain of the Subordinated Claims. The Bankruptcy Court has entered several orders disallowing andexpunging Subordinated Claims that we
re subject to these omnibus objections, and certain Subordinated Claims subject to these omnibus objections remainpending. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
expect to file additional omnibus objections with respect to certain of the Subordinated Claims and to continue to actunder the procedures approved by 
the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the Subordinated Claims.Based on discussions with certain hold
ers of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a loss inconnection with the HoldCo Rescission or Dam
age Claims. As of the date of this filing, PG&E Corporation determined that the amount or range of such loss is notreasonably estimable b
ecause either a negotiated resolution would be contingent upon available insurance coverage, the scope of which has not yet been agreed, orany negotiated resolutions would b
e limited to a subset of immaterial claims. PG&E Corporation is further unable to estimate the amount or range of loss becausethe nature and value of HoldCo Resciss
ion or Damage Claims varies significantly among potential claimholders, and as of the date of this filing, PG&ECorporation has only engaged in substan
tive discussions with a limited subset of claimholders.PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to believe it is reasonably possible that they will incur a loss in connection with the Subordinated Debt Claims but areunable to reasonably esti
mate the amount or range of loss because the nature and value, if any, of such claims varies significantly among potential claimholders. Asof December 31, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility have not recorded a liability in connection with the Subordinated Claims.De-energization Securities Class Action
On October 25, 2019, a purported securit
ies class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Vataj v. Johnson et al
. The complaint named as de fendants a then-current director and certain then-current and former officers of PG&E Corporation. Neither PG&ECorporation nor the Utility was na
med as a defendant. The complaint alleged materially false and misleading statements regarding PG&E Corporation’s wildfireprevention and safety proto
cols and policies, including regarding the Utility’s PSPS events, that allegedly resulted in losses and damages to holders of PG&ECorporation’s securities. Th
e complaint asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, andsought unspecified monetary 
relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs.On April 17, 2020, the plaintiffs fi
led an amended complaint asserting the same claims. The amended complaint added PG&E Corporation and a current officer ofPG&E Corporation as defendants, and re
moved claims against certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation previously named in the action.On February 16, 2021, the plaintiffs f
iled a motion with the District Court for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement. On November 2, 2021, the DistrictCourt entered an order gran
ting final approval of the settlement, which is now effective. Pursuant to the settlement stipulation: (1) PG&E Corporation paid$10 million, and (2) plaint
iffs and the Settlement Class (as defined in the stipulation of settlement) released the Released Persons (as defined in the stipulation ofsettlement, including PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and each of their officers, directors, as well as the current and former officers named in both the originaland amended complaints) 
from all claims that have been or could have been asserted by or on behalf of PG&E Corporation shareholders that relate to (a)allegations that were 
asserted or could have been asserted in either of the complaints in Vataj , and (b) investments in PG&E Corporat ion’s stock during the relevantperiod specified in the 
stipulation of settlement.170

Indemnification Obligations and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance CoverageTo the extent permitt
ed by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while adirector or office
r is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations extend to the claims asserted against certain directors and officers in thesecurities class actions an
d in the litigation matters enumerated above under the heading “Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation.” PG&E Corporation and theUtility maintain dir
ectors’ and officers’ insurance coverage to reduce their exposure to such indemnification obligations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility haveprovided notice to their
 insurance carriers of the claims asserted in the litigation matters enumerated above under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities ClassAction” and “Wildfire-Related
 Derivative Litigation,” and are in arbitration with the carriers regarding, among other things, the applicability of multiple years ofdirectors’ and officers’ ins
urance policies to those matters. Recovery under the directors’ and officers’ insurance policies in one such litigation matter will impactthe directors’ and officers’ i
nsurance proceeds available in the other matters.On March 17, 2021, the trustee for th
e Fire Victim Trust filed a lawsuit entitled Trotter v. PG&E Corporation, et al. , in San Francisco Superior Court, seeking, among other things, a decla
ration that the trustee for the Fire Victim Trust be permitted to participate in the arbitration with the carriers. The trustee named PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and th
e insurance carriers as defendants. On March 25, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility removed the action to the BankruptcyCourt. On March 29, 2021, the Fire Victim Trus
t filed a motion to remand the lawsuit back to state court, which the Bankruptcy Court denied on April 20, 2021.On April 30, 2021, the Fire Victim Trust mov
ed for summary judgment. Oppositions and cross-motions to the summary judgment motion were filed by PG&ECorporation, the Utility and th
e insurance carriers on May 21, 2021. On June 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order denying the Fire Victim Trust’smotion for summary judgmen
t and granting the defendants’ cross-motions for summary judgment. On June 29, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment infavor of all defendants 
and against the Fire Victim Trust.PG&E Corporation and the Utility addi
tionally have potential indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to theunderwriting agreements 
associated with those offerings. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indemnification obligations to the officers, directors andunderwriters may be lim
ited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases, among other things.The extent of PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s recovery of the directors’ and officers’ insurance proceeds could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Butte County District Attorney’s Offic
e Investigation into the 2018 Camp FireFollowing the 2018 Camp fire, the Butte County Dis
trict Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office opened a criminal investigation of the2018 Camp fire.
On March 17, 2020, the Utility enter
ed into the Plea Agreement and Settlement (the “Plea Agreement”) with the People of the State of California, by and throughthe Butte County District Attorney
’s office to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. Subject to the terms andconditions of the Plea Agreem
ent, the Utility pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192(b) and one count ofunlawfully causing a fire 
in violation of Penal Code section 452, and to admit special allegations pursuant to Penal Code sections 452.1(a)(2), 452.1(a)(3) and452.1(a)(4).
On August 20, 2021, the Butte County Superior Court held a bri
ef hearing on the status of restitution, which involves distribution of funds from the Fire VictimTrust. The Court continued the hea
ring to February 25, 2022.Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCC
On December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into the TCC RSA. The TCC RSA (as incorporated into the Plan) provides for, among otherthings, a combination of cash 
and common stock of the reorganized PG&E Corporation to be provided by PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Plan(together with certa
in additional rights, the “Aggregate Fire Victim Consideration”) in order to settle and discharge the Fire Victim Claims, upon the terms andconditions set forth in the TCC RSA and the Plan. The Aggr
egate Fire Victim Consideration that has funded and will fund the Fire Victim Trust pursuant to thePlan for the benefit of hold
ers of the Fire Victim Claims consists of (a) $5.40 billion in cash that was contributed on the Emergence Date, (b) $1.35 billion in cashconsisting of (i) $758 mill
ion that was paid in cash on January 15, 2021 and (ii) the remaining balance of $592 million that was paid in cash on January 18, 2022,in each case pursuant to th
e terms of the tax benefits payment agreement between the Fire Victim Trust and the Utility, and (c) an amount of common stockrepresenting 22.19% of the outs
tanding shares of PG&E Corporation on the Emergence Date, subject to potential adjustments.171

NOTE 15: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigationmatters and environmen
tal remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of theloss can be reasonably esti
mated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lowerend of the range, unless an amoun
t within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, penaltiesrelated to regulato
ry compliance, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation and the Utilityexclude anticipated 
legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connectionwith agreements enter
ed into to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have financialcommitments describ
ed in “Other Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flowsmay be materially 
affected by the outcome of the following matters.Enforcement Matters
U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
In connection with the Utili
ty’s probation proceeding, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California had the ability to impose additionalprobation conditions on the Util
ity. On January 25, 2022, the period of probation expired.CPUC and FERC Matters
Order Instituting Investigation into the 2017 Northern California Wildf
ires and the 2018 Camp FireOn June 27, 2019, the CPUC issued the Wildfires OII to de
termine whether the Utility “violated any provision(s) of the California Public Utilities Code,Commission General 
Orders or decisions, or other applicable rules or requirements pertaining to the maintenance and operation of its electric facilities that wereinvolved in igniting fires 
in its service territory in 2017.” On December 5, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a second amended scoping memo and rulingthat amended the scope of 
issues to be considered in this proceeding to include the 2018 Camp fire.As previously disclosed, on December 17, 2019, 
the Utility, the SED of the CPUC, the CPUC’s Office of the Safety Advocate, and the Coalition of CaliforniaUtility Employees jointly sub
mitted to the CPUC a proposed settlement agreement in connection with this proceeding and jointly moved for its approval. Thesettlement agreement became effective on
 the Emergence Date.Pursuant to the settleme
nt agreement, the Utility agreed to (i) not seek rate recovery of wildfire-related expenses and capital expenditures in future applications inthe amount of $1.625 billion, as spe
cified below, and (ii) incur costs of $50 million in shareholder-funded system enhancement initiatives as described further inthe settlement agreement. The am
ounts set forth in the table below include actual recorded costs and forecasted cost estimates as of the date of the settlementagreement for expenses 
and capital expenditures which the Utility has incurred or planned to incur to comply with its legal obligations to provide safe and reliableservice. While actual costs i
ncurred for certain cost categories are different than what was assumed in the settlement agreement, the Utility recorded $1.625 billionof the disallowed costs for th
e year ended December 31, 2020.172

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.The Utility expects addit
ional system enhancement spending pursuant to the settlement agreement to occur through 2025.On April 20, 2020, the assigned commissione
r issued a decision different adopting, with changes, the proposed modifications set forth in the request for review.The decision different 
(i) increases the amount of disallowed wildfire expenditures by $198 million (as set forth in the POD); (ii) increases the amount ofshareholder funding for syste
m enhancement initiatives by $64 million (as set forth in the POD); (iii) imposes a $200 million fine but permanently suspendspayment of the fine; and 
(iv) limits the tax savings that must be returned to customers to those savings generated by disallowed operating expenditures. Thedecision different a
lso denies all pending appeals of the POD and denies, in part, the Utility’s motion requesting other relief. The CPUC approved the decisiondifferent on May 7, 2020.
As it relates to the addi
tional $198 million in disallowed costs as adopted in the decision different, the Utility has recorded the full amount, primarily in theWMPMA through December 31, 2021.
Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before theFERC has issued a final decision. The Util
ity bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimateof the amounts that are p
robable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, March 1, 2018, and May 1, 2019 for the TO rate case for2017 (“TO18”), the TO rate case fo
r 2018 (“TO19”), and the TO rate case for 2019 (“TO20”), respectively.On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among o
ther things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required theallocation of all co
mmon plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for thelimited purpose of allowing 
the parties an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology adopted in FERC OpinionNo. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying 
requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utilityfiled four appeals. The app
eals related to two issues: (i) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (ii) aspects of the rehearing orderother than the Tax Act. The appe
als have been consolidated and are currently being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue.As a result of an order denying r
ehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its Regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during theTO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 th
rough the fourth quarter of 2021 by approximately $324 million. A portion of these common plant costs areexpected to be recover
ed at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, the Utility has recorded approximately $197 million to Regulatory assets.(1)(2)

On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party settlement with the FERC, which was approved by the FERC on December 20, 2018, in connection withTO19. As part of the settlement, 
the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon issuanceof a final unappealabl
e decision in the TO18 proceeding.On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved an all-pa
rty settlement agreement in connection with TO20. The TO20 settlement resolved all issues of the Utility’sformula rate. However, some o
f the formula rate issues are contingent on the outcome of TO18, including the allocation of costs related to common, general andintangible plant. The set
tlement provides that the formula rate will remain in effect through December 31, 2023. The TO20 rate case provides that the transmissionrevenue requirement 
and rates are to be updated annually on January 1, subject to true-up. The Utility is required to make a successor rate filing in 2023, whichwould go into effect on January 1, 2024.
2018 CEMA Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophicevents that included fi
re and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017to cut back or remove dead o
r dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The Utility filed three revisions to thisapplication, resulting 
in a total cost recovery request of $763 million.On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s reques
t for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at thattime. The interim r
ate relief was implemented commencing on October 1, 2019. Costs included in the interim rate relief are subject to audit and refund.On November 2, 2021, the Utility filed 
a settlement agreement with the active parties in the matter. The settlement agreement, if approved by the CPUC, wouldauthorize the Utility 
to collect a total of $683 million plus interest for the 2018 CEMA application. As noted above, $373 million of the total amount has alreadybeen collected in int
erim rates. The interim rates would become final and no longer subject to refund. The remainder of the authorized revenue requirement that hasyet to be collected would be 
amortized over a 12-month period.2020 WMCE Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund
On September 30, 2020, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation, certaincatastrophic events, and 
a number of other activities (the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which exclude amounts disallowed as a result ofthe CPUC’s decision in the OII into the 2017 North
ern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, consist of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capitalexpenditures, resulting in 
a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion.As previously disclosed, on October 23, 2020, the CPUC approved $447 m
illion in interim rate relief (which includes interest) pertaining to costs addressed in the2020 WMCE application. All of the cos
ts presented in the 2020 WMCE application are subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review, which could result in someor all of the interim rate relief of
 $447 million being subject to refund.The costs addressed in the 2020 WMCE appl
ication cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and are incremental to those previously authorized in theUtility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The 
majority of costs addressed in this application reflect work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk and to respond tocatastrophic events oc
curring during the years 2017 to 2019. The Utility’s requested revenue includes amounts for the FHPMA of $293 million, the FRMMA andthe WMPMA of $740 million, and the CEMA of $251 mil
lion.On September 21, 2021, the Utility fi
led a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would authorize the Utility to continue torecover an interim 
revenue requirement of $447 million over a 17-month amortization period, followed by an additional revenue requirement of $591 million overa 24-month amortizat
ion period. On September 23, 2021, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline for a PD in this hearing to April 1, 2022.174

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case and 2011-2014 Gas Transmission and Storage Capital Expenditures AuditIn its final decision in 
the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014. This was theamount forecast to be r
ecorded in excess of the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount andordered that the rem
aining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a futureproceeding. The audit repor
t was released June 2, 2020 and did not recommend any additional disallowances. The 2015 GT&S decision authorized the Utility toseek recovery, through a sepa
rate application, of those costs not recommended for disallowance by the audit.On July 31, 2020, the Utility filed an app
lication seeking recovery of $416.3 million in 2015 to 2022 revenue associated with $512 million of recorded capitalexpenditures. On July 7, 2021, the Utility 
filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement reached with the active parties in the proceeding. If approved by theCPUC, the settlement agreemen
t would resolve all issues in this proceeding and would authorize a $356.3 million revenue requirement for the period of 2015through 2022. Of this amount, $313.3 million o
f revenues for the period 2015 through 2021 would be amortized in rates over 60 months and $43 million associatedwith 2022 would be amortized in ra
tes over 12 months through an annual gas true-up filing for rates effective January 1, 2022. Going forward, the as-yetundepreciated capit
al plant associated with this application would be included in test year 2023 rate base in the Utility’s consolidated 2023 GRC. No partysubmitted comments on the s
ettlement.The Utility is unable to det
ermine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various claims and lawsuits that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for contingencies related to suchmatters (excluding a
mounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”) totaled $77 million and $144 million as ofDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, r
espectively. These amounts were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements.PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not be
lieve it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financialcondition, results of opera
tions, or cash flows.PSPS Class Action
On December 19, 2019, a complaint was f
iled in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California naming PG&E Corporation and theUtility. The plaintiff s
eeks certification of a class consisting of all California residents and business owners who had their power shut off by the Utility during theOctober 9, October 23, October 26, October 28, o
r November 20, 2019 power outages and any subsequent voluntary outages occurring during the course oflitigation. The plaint
iff alleges that the necessity for the October and November 2019 power shutoff events was caused by the Utility’s negligence in failing toproperly maintain its 
electrical lines and surrounding vegetation. The complaint seeks up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and exemplarydamages and injunctive r
elief to require the Utility to properly maintain and inspect its power grid. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the allegations arewithout merit and intend to d
efend this lawsuit vigorously.On January 21, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative strike the class action allegations. On March30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Ut
ility’s motion to dismiss this class action because the plaintiff’s class action claims are preempted as a matter of lawby the California Public Util
ities Code. On April 3, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing the action without leave to amend.The plaintiff appeal
ed the decision dismissing the complaint to the District Court. On March 26, 2021, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissalof this action, and the pla
intiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellant filed its opening brief on June 25, 2021. A formerexecutive director o
f the CPUC filed an amicus brief on July 2, 2021, asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the decision of the District Court and toremand the case for fu
rther proceedings. The answering brief of PG&E Corporation and the Utility was filed August 25, 2021. On September 1, 2021, the CPUCfiled an amicus brie
f asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to affirm the District Court’s dismissal. The appellant’s reply brief was filed on October 15, 2021.A panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appe
als heard oral argument on the plaintiff’s appeal on January 12, 2022.The Utility is unable to det
ermine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.175

CZU Lightning Complex Fire Notices of ViolationBetween November 2020 and January 2021, sever
al governmental entities raised concerns regarding the Utility’s emergency response to the 2020 CZU LightningComplex fire, including Cal Fir
e, the California Coastal Commission, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, and Santa Cruz County Board ofSupervisors alleging environm
ental, vegetation management, and unpermitted work violations. In the matter of Santa Cruz County’s complaint with the CPUC, theparties reached a se
ttlement, and the CPUC dismissed the complaint on December 15, 2021. The Utility continues to work with the California CoastalCommission, Cal Fire, and the Centra
l Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board to resolve any outstanding issues and to work with Santa Cruz County toimplement the terms of the settleme
nt agreement.Based on the information cur
rently available, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Accordingly, PG&ECorporation and the Utility r
ecorded a charge during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021 for an amount that is not material. PG&E Corporation and theUtility do not believe tha
t the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Violationscan result in penalties, reme
diation and other relief.Environmental Remediation Contingencies
Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities req
uires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate thatremediation is probabl
e, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liabilitybased on the lower end of the rang
e of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors thatinform the development of
 estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,post-remediation moni
toring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to theirpresent value. The Utility
’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprisedof the following:

 Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.
The Utility’s gas compressor s
tations, former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and disposalof potentially hazardous subs
tances are subject to requirements issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Resource Conservation andRecovery Act in addition to othe
r state hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with federal, state, and locallaws and regulations rela
ted to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors theenvironmental requirements o
n an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the DTSC, several California reg
ional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.The Utility’s environment
al remediation liability as of December 31, 2021, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the currentassessment data and regul
atory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans,the Utility’s time frame for remediati
on, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materiallydifferent than this es
timate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which theyare recorded. As of Decembe
r 31, 2021, the Utility expected to recover $982 million of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through variousratemaking mechanis
ms authorized by the CPUC. (1)(2)

Natural Gas Compressor Station SitesThe Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gascompressor stations. The Util
ity is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.Topock Site
The Utility’s remedia
tion and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of theInterior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized 
the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic andnon-soluble form of chromiu
m. Construction activities began in October 2018 and will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costsassociated with the Topock sit
e may increase by as much as $220 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. Thecosts associated with environ
mental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recoveredthrough rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been imple
menting remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and controlmovement of the plume. The Ut
ility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional WaterQuality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In Novemb
er 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up andabatement order directing the 
Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The finalorder states that the Ut
ility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally,the final order sets plu
me capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.The United States Geological Survey 
team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. A draftbackground report was receiv
ed in January 2020 and is expected to be finalized in 2022. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley sitemay increase by as much as $138 
million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated withenvironmental remed
iation at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce g
as for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this processwere often disposed of at the MGPs the
mselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of thesites in the program have b
een addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $477 million if the extentof contamination or neces
sary remediation at currently identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at theMGP sites are recovered through 
the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Part
y Disposal SitesUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated withUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $50 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation isgreater than anticipated. The
 environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recoveredthrough the HSM, where 90% of the costs ar
e recovered through rates.Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites
In 1998, the Utility divested i
ts generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, theUtility retained the 
environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generationsites may increase by as
 much as $43 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediationcosts associated with the foss
il fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.177

Nuclear InsuranceThe Utility maintains mu
ltiple insurance policies through NEIL, a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities, and EMANI, covering nuclear or non-nuclear events at the Ut
ility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt Bay Unit 3.  NEIL provides insurance coverag
e for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur atthe Utility’s two nuclear g
enerating units at Diablo Canyon. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclearincident and $2.7 billion per non
-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon. For Humboldt Bay Unit 3, NEIL provides up to $50 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.
NEIL also provides coverage for d
amages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to $3.2 billion available to themembership to cover this 
exposure. This coverage amount is shared by all NEIL members and applies to all terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month periodagainst one or more comm
ercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL.In addition to the nuclea
r insurance the Utility maintains through NEIL, the Utility also is a member of EMANI. EMANI shares losses with NEIL as part of thefirst $400 million in cove
rage for nuclear or non-nuclear property damages. Additional coverage is procured through EMANI, which provides excess insurancecoverage for property da
mages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. Theexcess insurance coverag
e through EMANI provides an additional $200 million for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amountrecoverable under the Ut
ility’s NEIL policies.If NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,the maximum aggregat
e annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $42 million.  If EMANI losses in any policy year exceedaccumulated funds, the Uti
lity could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $4 million. Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation ofmaterial to and fro
m Diablo Canyon are limited to approximately $13.6 billion. The Utility purchases the maximum available public liability insurance of$450 million for Diablo Canyon. The bal
ance of the $13.6 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among nuclear reactor owners.The Utility may be assessed up to $275 
million per nuclear incident under this loss sharing program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of$41 million per incident. Both 
the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at
 the fuel fabricator’s facility. The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidentsup to a maximum of $450 mill
ion per incident. In addition, the Utility has approximately $53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a$500 million indemnific
ation from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess of the$53 million in liabili
ty insurance.Diablo Canyon Outages
Diablo Canyon Unit 2 experienced fiv
e outages between July 2020 and April 2021, each due or related to malfunctions within the main generator associated withexcessive vibrations. Addition
al inspections and replacement of a redesigned component of the generator occurred during Unit 2’s planned spring 2021 refuelingoutage. The affected co
mponent is part of the secondary system and does not involve a risk of release of radioactive material into the environment. During July2020 through April 2021, the Utility imp
lemented effective corrective actions. The Utility continues to monitor the affected component.If additional shutdowns occur in 
the future, the Utility may incur incremental costs or forgo additional power market revenues. The Utility will also be subject to areview of the reasonablen
ess of its actions before the CPUC in the 2021 Energy Resource Recovery Account compliance proceeding.PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not cu
rrently believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material impact on their financial condition, results ofoperations, or cash flows.

ess, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchaseagreements to purchase powe
r and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the currentmarket price of either natural ga
s or electricity at the date of delivery.Renewable Energy
 Power Purchase Agreements.  In order to comply with Califo rnia’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to itscustomers at a gradual
ly increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement. TheUtility’s obligations under 
a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expectedto grow.  As of December 31, 2021, renewable en
ergy contracts expire at various dates between 2022 and 2041.Conventional Energy Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, whichinclude tolling agree
ments and RA agreements.  The Utility’s obligations under a portion of these agreements are contingent on the third parties’ development ofnew generation facili
ties to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. These power purchase agreements expire at various dates between 2022 and 2041.Other Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that owngeneration facili
ties that meet the definition of a QF under federal law. As of December 31, 2021, QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 2022and 2041.  In addition, the Utility h
as agreements with various irrigation districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.The net costs incurred for 
all power purchases and electric capacity amounted to $3.0 billion in 2021, $2.9 billion in 2020, and $3.0 billion in 2019.Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments 
The Utility purchases natur
al gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-generation facili
ties.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the US RockyMountain supply area, and the southwes
tern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire atvarious dates between 2022 and 2041.  In add
ition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in Northern California to more reliably meetcustomers’ loads.
Costs incurred for natural g
as purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,amounted to $1.2 billion in 2021, $0.8 bil
lion in 2020, and $0.9 billion in 2019.179

Nuclear Fuel AgreementsThe Utility has entered in
to several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2022 and 2024 and are intended toensure long-term nucle
ar fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide securityof supply.  Pricing terms are 
also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices. Payments for nuclear fue
l amounted to $79 million in 2021, $111 million in 2020, and $74 million in 2019.Other Commitments

On October 23, 2020, the Utility and BA2 300 Lakeside LLC (“L
andlord”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC, entered into anoffice lease agreement for appro
ximately 910,000 rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrativeheadquarters (the “Le
ase”). In connection with the Lease, the Utility also issued to Landlord (i) an option payment letter of credit in the amount of $75 million, and(ii) a lease secur
ity letter of credit in the amount of $75 million.The term of the Lease wil
l begin on or about April 8, 2022. The Lease term will expire 34 years and 11 months after the commencement date, unless earlierterminated in acco
rdance with the terms of the Lease. In addition to base rent, the Utility will be responsible for certain costs and charges specified in the Lease,including insurance costs, m
aintenance costs and taxes.The Lease requires the Land
lord to pursue approvals to subdivide the real estate it owns surrounding the Lakeside Building to create a separate legal parcel thatcontains the Lakeside Building 
(the “Property”) that can be sold to the Utility. The Lease grants to the Utility an option to purchase the Property, following suchsubdivision, at a price of $892 m
illion, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price would not be paid until 2023.As space in the Lakeside Building be
comes available following the expiration of existing tenants’ leases and completion of the redevelopment of the property tothe Utility’s specifi
cations, the Utility expects to relocate employees and operations from the SFGO and certain East Bay office locations to the Lakeside Buildingin phases over several yea

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal controlover financial reporting incl
udes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe transactions and disposi
tions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation o
f financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or
 disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management assessed the e
ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria,management has concluded 
that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independen
t registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2021, b
ased on criteria established in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Com
mission.181

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board o
f Directors of PG&E CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, therelated consolidated s
tatements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, andthe related notes and the
 schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statementspresent fairly, in al
l material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flowsfor each of the three y
ears in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(GAAP).
We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control —  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza
tions of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on theCompany's internal control ove
r financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the US federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especiallychallenging, subjective, o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, takenas a whole, and we are not, by communi
cating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts ordisclosures to which they rel
ate.Regulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 14 to the financial sta
tementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas 
& Electric Company, follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover“revenue requiremen
ts” that have been authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission basedon its cost of providing servic
e. Pacific Gas & Electric Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not berecorded under GAAP for nonregulated en
tities. Pacific Gas & Electric Company capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise becharged to expense if it 
is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.182

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affectedaccount balances and disc
losures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates duein part to the uncerta
inty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate settingprocess due to its inherent 
complexities and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’sconclusions that the costs app
roved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset under GAAP and are recorded at theappropriate amount.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures
 related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of futuredecisions by the rate regu
lators and the costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes that meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded atthe appropriate amount 
included the following, among others:•

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board o
f Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric CompanyOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the "Utility") as of December 31, 2021 and2020, the related consolida
ted statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2021, and the rela
ted notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, thefinancial statem
ents present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Utility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operationsand its cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America (GAAP).
We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Utility's internal controlover financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Utility's internal controlover financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Utility's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Utility's financial statements basedon our audits. We are a publi
c accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance with the USfederal securiti
es laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especiallychallenging, subjective, o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, takenas a whole, and we are not, by communi
cating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts ordisclosures to which they rel
ate.186

Regulation and Regulated Operations – Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 14 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the California Public Util
ities Commission (“CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission based on its cost of providing service. The Utility recordsassets and liabiliti
es that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitalizes andrecords, as regulatory ass
ets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates. Weidentified the impact of rate reg
ulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affectedaccount balances and disc
losures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates duein part to the uncerta
inty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate settingprocess due to its inherent 
complexities and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’sconclusions that the costs app
roved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset under GAAP and are recorded at theappropriate amount.

erred StockThe rights of holders of Common Stock m
ay be materially limited or qualified by the rights of holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Set forthbelow is a description of PG&E Corporat
ion’s authority to issue preferred stock and the possible terms of that stock.Our Board of Directors is authori
zed, pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fixand determine the numbe
r of shares of preferred stock of any series, to determine the designation of any such series, to increase or decrease the number of shares ofany such series subsequent to the 
issue of shares of that series, and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposedupon any such series.
Prior to the issuance of shar
es of each series of our preferred stock, our Board of Directors is required to adopt resolutions and file a certificate of determinationwith the Secretary of Stat
e of the State of California. The certificate of determination will fix for each series the designation and number of shares and the rights,preferences, privil
eges and restrictions of the shares including, but not limited to, the following:•the title and stated value
 of the preferred stock;•voting rights, if any, of the pr
eferred stock;•any rights and terms of red
emption (including sinking fund provisions);•the dividend rate(s), pe
riod(s) and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation applicable to the preferred stock;•whether dividends are cumul
ative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on the preferred stock will accumulate;•the relative ranking 
and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;•the terms and conditions, i
f applicable, upon which the preferred stock will be convertible into our Common Stock, including the conversion price (or manner ofcalculation) and conve
rsion period;•the provision for redempt
ion, if applicable, of the preferred stock;•the provisions for a sinking fund, i
f any, for the preferred stock;•liquidation preferences;
•any limitations on issuanc
e of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the class or series of preferred stock as to dividend rightsand rights upon liquidation, dissolu
tion or winding up of our affairs; and•any other specific terms,
 preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock.All shares of preferred s
tock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable and will not have any preemptive or similar rights.In addition to the terms 
listed above, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following terms relating to the class or series of preferred stock being offered:
•the number of shares of preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock;•the procedures for any auc
tion and remarketing, if any, for the preferred stock;•any listing of the prefe
rred stock on any securities exchange; and•a discussion of a
ny material and/or special United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock.Until our Board of Directors det
ermines the rights of the holders of a series of preferred stock, we cannot predict the effect of the issuance of any shares of suchseries of preferred s
tock upon the rights of holders of our Common Stock. However, the effect could include one or more of the following:•restricting dividends on our Com
mon Stock;•diluting the voting power of our Common Sto
ck;•impairing the liquida
tion rights of our Common Stock; or•delaying or preventing a ch
ange in control of us without further action by our shareholders.Our preferred stock, if issu
ed, would rank, with respect to dividends and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up:•senior to all classes or s
eries of our Common Stock and to all of our equity securities ranking junior to the preferred stock;•on a parity with all of our equ
ity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank on a parity with the preferred stock; and•junior to all of our equity s
ecurities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank senior to the preferred stock.Holding Company Structure
PG&E Corporation conducts its operat
ions primarily through its subsidiaries and substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries, includingPacific Gas and Electri
c Company (the “Utility”). Accordingly, PG&E Corporation’s cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent uponthe earnings of its subsidia
ries and the distribution or other payment of these earnings to PG&E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances andrepayment of loans and advan
ces. PG&E Corporation’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts or make anyfunds available for paym
ent pursuant to PG&E Corporation’s obligations.Because PG&E Corporation is a holding comp
any, its obligations will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, includingall debt securities 
and issued and outstanding preferred stock of the Utility (see Exhibit 4.[51](b) for a description of such preferred stock). Furthermore, the rightsof PG&E Corporation to participa
te in the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or reorganization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims ofsuch subsidiary’s creditors, 
including any holders of preferred stock of such subsidiary. To the extent that PG&E Corporation is itself a creditor with recognizedclaims against any of i
ts subsidiaries, its claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interest in, or mortgages or other liens on, the assets of thesubsidiary and would be subordinated to 
any indebtedness or other liabilities of the subsidiary that are senior to the claims held by PG&E Corporation.Description of the Equity Units
In July and August 2020, we issued 16,000,000 Equity Units, each with 
a stated amount of $100. Each Equity Unit is comprised of (i) a prepaid forward stockpurchase contract (a 
“purchase contract”) of PG&E Corporation and (ii) a
1/48,000th undivided beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips that mature on a quarterly basis from, and including, August 15, 2020 through,and including, August 15, 2023 and are held by th
e custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units (a “U.S. treasury strips component”). The followingsummary of the terms of 
the Equity Units, the summary of the terms of the purchase contracts set forth under the caption “Description of the Purchase Contracts”and the summary of the te
rms of the U.S. treasury strips components set forth under the caption “Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components” belowcontain a description of 
all of the material terms of the Equity Units and their components but are not complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety byreference to, the related contracts
. We refer you to the purchase contract agreement and the custodial agreement, which are incorporated by reference to thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of the Equity Units
Each Equity Unit is comprised of:
•
a prepaid forward stock purch ase contract of PG&E Corporation entitling the holder to receive a number of shares of our Common Stock onAugust 16, 2
023 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances, the “purchase contract settlement date”), or earlier if a“fundamental change” occurs
 prior to the settlement date or if the holder has elected “early settlement” (in each case, as defined herein anddescribed below), determ
ined by reference to the settlement rate described below; and•
a U.S. treasury strips component. Unless previously settled at 
the holder’s option as described in “Description of the Purchase Contracts-Early Settlement” or “Description of the PurchaseContracts-Early Settle
ment Upon a Fundamental Change,” we will deliver to the holder, on the purchase contract settlement date, in respect of each purchasecontract not more than 10.5263 sh
ares of our Common Stock and not less than 8.5929 shares of our Common Stock, based upon the applicable “settlement rate”(as defined below), which is subje
ct to adjustment as described herein, and the “applicable market value” (as defined below) of our Common Stock, as describedbelow under “Description of the Pur
chase Contracts-Delivery of Common Stock.”Each holder of Equity Units will be p
aid the amount received by the custodian from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying theEquity Units owned by such holder on the business day 
immediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15 andNovember 15 of each year, with such p
ayments commencing on, and including, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023, as describedbelow under “Description of the U.S. Tre
asury Strips Components.”The stated amount of each Equ
ity Unit must be allocated between the U.S. treasury strips component and the purchase contract based upon their relative fairmarket values. We have d
etermined that the fair market value of each U.S. treasury strips component is $17.1402 and the fair market value of each purchasecontract is $82.8574. Each holder 
agrees to such allocation and this position is binding upon each holder (but not on the Internal Revenue Service).Separating and Recreating Equity Units
Upon the conditions and under the ci
rcumstances described below, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) has the right to separate itsEquity Units into its component pa
rts, and a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral multiple thereof) and the underlying U.S. treasury stripshas the right to combine th
ese components to recreate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof).Separating Equity Units
At initial issuance, the pu
rchase contracts and U.S. treasury strips components may be purchased and transferred only as Equity Units and will trade under theCUSIP number for the Equity Units.
On any business day during the period beginn
ing on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will havethe right to separate su
ch Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000thbeneficial ownership int
erest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any separation of Equity Units
may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units. To withdraw the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units, the holder must:•
deliver the relevan t Equity Units to the purchase contract agent; and•
deliver a notice to th e purchase contract agent requesting that the purchase contract agent instruct the custodian to release to the holder the U.S.treasury strips underlying 
those Equity Units.The purchase contract ag
ent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts underlying those Equity Units, which we refer toas “separate purchase 
contracts” and (ii) instruct the custodian to deliver to the holder the underlying U.S. treasury strips. If the holder has withdrawn the U.S.treasury strips previously und
erlying an Equity Unit, it may either continue to hold the separate purchase contract in global form through the purchase contractagent or receive a certificate for its
 separate purchase contract and hold it directly as the owner registered on the purchase contract register maintained on ourbehalf by the purchase cont
ract registrar. Any administrative fees and expenses related to withdrawing the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units thatare payable to the purch
ase contract agent or the custodian will be at the expense of the holder of Equity Units requesting withdrawal.“Business day”
 means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or obligated byapplicable law or execu
tive order to close or be closed.There is no current or expe
cted trading market for the separate purchase contracts and we do not intend to apply to have the separate purchase contracts listed onany securities exchange o
r quoted on any automated quotation system. Accordingly, we do not expect there to be a liquid market in the separate purchase contractsat any time. Separate pu
rchase contracts and the withdrawn U.S. treasury strips will be transferable independently from each other.Recreating Equity Units
On any business day during the period beginn
ing on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral multiplethereof) will have the 
right to recreate Equity Units by delivering, for every 48,000 Equity Units being recreated, (i) to the purchase contract agent, 48,000 separatepurchase contracts, and (
ii) to the custodian, $66,000 face amount (or $33,000 face amount in the case of the U.S. treasury strips maturing on August 15, 2020) ofeach of the U.S. treasury strips 
that would be then remaining as a portion of the U.S. treasury strips component of an Equity Unit. Any recreation of Equity Unitsmay be made only in integr
al multiples of 48,000 Equity Units. R'The newly deposited U.S. treasury strips used to recreate the Equity Units must have the sameCUSIP numbers as the ones originally comp
rising the U.S. treasury strips component.Global Securities
Each Equity Unit and purchase cont
ract are represented by global securities registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).Holders are not entitled
 to receive definitive physical certificates for the Equity Units and purchase contracts, except under the limited circumstances describedunder “Book-Entry Procedures and Sett
lement.” Beneficial interests in an Equity Unit and, after separation, the separate purchase contract, will be representedthrough book-entry accounts of, and 
transfers will be effected through, direct or indirect participants in DTC.Deemed Actions by Holders by Acceptance
Each holder of Equity Units or sepa
rate purchase contracts, by acceptance of such securities, is deemed to have:•
irrevocably authorized and  directed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and perform on its behalf the purchase contract agreement,and appointed the purchase con
tract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes;
•in the case of a purchase contract that is a component of an Equity Unit, or that is evidenced by a separate purchase contract, irrevocablyauthorized and direct
ed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and hold on its behalf the separate purchase contract or the componentpurchase contract evid
encing such purchase contract, and appointed the purchase contract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any and all suchpurposes;
•
consented to, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement;•
in the case of a holder of an Equity Unit, agreed, for all purposes, including U.S. federal income tax purposes, to treat:•
an Equity Unit as an investment un it composed of two separate instruments, in accordance with its form;•
the allocation of the s tated amount per Equity Unit between the purchase contract and the U.S. treasury strips component so that suchholder’s initial tax b
asis in each purchase contract will be $82.8574 and such holder’s initial tax basis in each U.S. treasury stripscomponent will be $17.1402;
•
represented and warrant ed that neither the beneficial holder of the purchase contracts (including for these purposes a purchase contract that is acomponent of any Equity Unit) nor, to 
the knowledge of such beneficial holder, any other person, would become a “Substantial Shareholder”(as defined in the Amended Art
icles) as a result of such beneficial holder’s acquisition of purchase contracts (treating the beneficial holder andany such other person as actua
lly holding, solely for purposes of this representation, the number of shares of our Common Stock that would bereceived upon settlement at t
he maximum settlement rate of all purchase contracts acquired or beneficially owned by such beneficial holder orany such other person, as applic
able, but treating all other purchase contracts as still unsettled), and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking intoaccount such beneficia
l holder’s and any such other person’s (i) current ownership of our Common Stock and any of the Utility’s preferredstock and (ii) other acqu
isitions of our Common Stock and any of the Utility’s preferred stock (if any) concurrent with or in connection withsuch beneficial holder
’s acquisition of purchase contracts; and•
appointed the custodian to hold on its behalf and to receive payments related to the U.S. treasury strips components and agreed to indemnifythe custodian from and aga
inst any liability it may incur in connection with such appointment in the absence of gross negligence or willfulmisconduct on its part.
Listing of Securities
Our Equity Units are listed on the NYSE under th
e symbol “PCGU.” However, listing on the NYSE does not guarantee that a trading market will develop, and theunderwriters may discontinu
e market making at any time in their sole discretion without prior notice to Equity Unit holders. Accordingly, there can be noassurance that a liquid 
trading market will develop for the Equity Units (or, if developed, that a liquid trading market will be maintained), that the holder will beable to sell Equity Units at 
a particular time or that the prices the holder receives when the holder sells will be favorable.Title
The purchase contract ag
ent may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit, which at initial issuance was a nominee of DTC, or, upon withdrawal of the U.S.treasury strips, the reg
istered owner of any separate purchase contract, as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of making payment and settling the purchasecontracts and for all o
ther purposes. Similarly, the custodian may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose ofmaking payments of the U.S. treasu
ry strips components and deliveries of the underlying U.S. treasury strips, if applicable, and for all other purposes.
Accounting for the Equity UnitsWe record the issuance o
f the purchase contract portion of the Equity Units as Common Stock, net of issuance costs of the purchase contracts, in our financialstatements. All of the pro
ceeds from the issuance of the U.S. treasury strips components were paid to the custodian, and we did not receive any proceeds from suchissuance.
Based on U.S. GAAP, we do not expect the purchase contract 
component of the Equity Units to be revalued under fair value accounting principles.Our earnings per share cal
culations will reflect the shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts portion of the Equity Units. Our basic earnings pershare will include the m
inimum shares issuable under the purchase contract for each period and our diluted earnings per share will include any incremental sharesthat would be issuable assuming a s
ettlement of the purchase contract at the end of each accounting period, if dilutive.Replacement of Equity Unit Certificates
In the event that physica
l certificates evidencing the Equity Units have been issued, any mutilated equity unit certificate will be replaced by us at the expense of theholder upon surrender of the c
ertificate to the purchase contract agent. Equity Unit certificates that have been destroyed, lost or stolen will be replaced by us at theexpense of the holder upon deliv
ery to us and the purchase contract agent of evidence of their destruction, loss or theft satisfactory to us and the purchase contractagent. In the case of a des
troyed, lost or stolen Equity Unit certificate, an indemnity satisfactory to us and the purchase contract agent may be required at theexpense of the holder of the Equ
ity Units before a replacement will be issued.Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will no
t be obligated to replace any Equity Unit certificates on or after the second scheduled trading day immediately precedingAugust 16, 2023 or any early settlem
ent date. In those circumstances, the purchase contract agreement will provide that, in lieu of the delivery of a replacementEquity Unit certifica
te, the purchase contract agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, will deliver or arrange for delivery of the sharesof Common Stock issuable pursuant to th
e purchase contracts included in the Equity Units evidenced by the Equity Unit certificate.Miscellaneous
The purchase contract ag
reement provides that we will pay all fees and expenses related to the offering of the Equity Units and the enforcement by the purchasecontract agent of the 
rights of the holders of the Equity Units or the separate purchase contracts, other than expenses (including legal fees) of the underwriters.Should the holder elect to sep
arate or recreate Equity Units, the holder will be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection with that separation orrecreation, and we will
 have no liability therefor.Description of the Purchase Contracts
The purchase contracts a
re issued pursuant to the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement. The following summary contains a description of all ofthe material te
rms of the purchase contracts but is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the purchasecontract agreement, including
 the definitions in the purchase contract agreement of certain terms. We refer you to the purchase contract agreement which isincorporated by refer
ence to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Each purchase contract wi
ll initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business dayimmediately following 
the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023,the holder will have the r
ight to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units.Following such separation, purchase 
contracts may be transferred separately from the U.S. treasury strips components.Delivery of Common Stock
Unless settled early at 
the holder’s option, for each purchase contract we will deliver to the holder on August 16, 2023 (subject to postponement in certain limitedcircumstances descr
ibed below, the “purchase contract settlement date”), a number of shares of our Common Stock. The number of shares of our Common Stockissuable upon settlement o
f each purchase contract (the “settlement rate”) will be determined by us as follows:
•if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price, then the holder will receive 8.5929 sharesof Common Stock
 for each purchase contract (the “minimum settlement rate”);•
if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is greater than or equal to the reference price but less than or equal to the thresholdappreciation price, 
then the holder will receive a number of shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract equal to the Equity Unit statedamount of $100, 
divided by the applicable market value; and •
if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is less than the reference price, then the holder will receive 10.5263 shares of CommonStock for each purcha
se contract (the “maximum settlement rate”).The maximum settlement rate and
 minimum settlement rate are each subject to adjustment as described under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed SettlementRates” below. Each
 of the minimum settlement rate and the maximum settlement rate is referred to as a “fixed settlement rate.”The reference pric
e is equal to $100 divided by  the maximum settle ment rate and is approximately equal to $9.5000.The threshold appreciat
ion price is equal to $100 divided by  the minimum settlement rate. T he threshold appreciation price, which is initially approximately$11.6375, represents an appreci
ation of approximately 22.50% over the reference price.For illustrative purposes only, 
the following table shows the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of a purchase contract at assumedapplicable market v
alues, based on a reference price of $9.5000 and a threshold appreciation price of $11.6375. The table assumes that there will be no adjustmentsto the fixed settlem
ent rates described below under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates” below or settled early at the option of holders asdescribed under “-Early Se
ttlement” or “-Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change” below. There can be no assurance that the actual applicable market valuewill be within the assumed rang
e set forth below.A holder of an Equity Unit or a separ
ate purchase contract, as applicable, would receive on the purchase contract settlement date the following numbers of sharesof Common Stock for each Equity Unit or s
eparate purchase contract at the following assumed applicable market values:Assumed Applicable Market Value
Number of Shares of Common Stock
$2.00
10.5263 $4.00
10.5263 $6.00
10.5263 $8.00
10.5263 $9.50
10.5263 $10.50
9.5238 $11.64
8.5929 $13.00
8.5929 $15.00
8.5929 $18.00
8.5929 $21.00
8.5929 $25.00
8.5929 $30.00
8.5929 $35.00
8.5929 
As the above table illustrates, if, on the purchase contract settlement date, the applicable market value is greater than the threshold appreciation price, we would beobligated to deliver 8.5929 sha
res of Common Stock for each purchase contract.If, on the purchase contra
ct settlement date, the applicable market value is less than or equal to the threshold appreciation price but greater than or equal to thereference price o
f approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to deliver a number of shares of our Common Stock on the purchase contract settlement dateequal to $100, 
divided by  the applicable mark et value. As a result, we would retain all appreciation in the market value of our Common Stock underlying eachpurchase contract between
 the reference price and the threshold appreciation price.If, on the purchase contra
ct settlement date, the applicable market value is less than the reference price of approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to deliverupon settlement of the pur
chase contract 10.5263 shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract, regardless of the market price of our Common Stock. As aresult, the holder would suffe
r the full decline in market value of the Common Stock below the reference price.Because the applicable 
market value of the Common Stock is determined over the “valuation period” (as defined below), the number of shares of Common Stockdelivered for each pur
chase contract may be greater than or less than the number that would have been delivered based on the closing price (or daily VWAP) of theCommon Stock on the last trading day o
f such valuation period. In addition, the holder will bear the risk of fluctuations in the market price of the shares ofCommon Stock deliverable upon set
tlement of the purchase contracts between the end of such valuation period and the date such shares are delivered.The term “applicabl
e market value” means the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock on each trading day of the valuation period.The term “valuation pe
riod” means each of the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately precedingAugust 16, 2023.
The “daily VWAP” of our Common Stock on any trad
ing day means the per share volume-weighted average price as displayed under the heading “BloombergVWAP” on Bloomberg page “PCG <equity> AQR” (or its equiva
lent successor if such page is not available) in respect of the period from the scheduled open oftrading until the schedul
ed close of trading of the primary trading session on such trading day (or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the marketvalue of one share of our Common Stock on su
ch trading day determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized independentinvestment banking firm 
retained for this purpose by us). The “daily VWAP” will be determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other trading outsideof the regular trading s
ession trading hours. The “average VWAP” per share over a certain period means the arithmetic average of the daily VWAP per share foreach trading day in such per
iod.“Trading day” means a day on which 
(i) there is no “market disruption event” (as defined below) and (ii) trading in our Common Stock (or other security for whicha daily VWAP must be determined
) generally occurs on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock (or such other security) is not then listed on the NYSE, on theprincipal other U.S. national o
r regional securities exchange on which our Common Stock (or such other security) is then listed or, if our Common Stock (or suchother security) is not th
en listed on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock (or such othersecurity) is then trad
ed. If our Common Stock (or such other security) is not so listed or traded, “trading day” means a “business day.”“Scheduled trading day” me
ans a day that is scheduled to be a trading day on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on the NYSE, on the principalother U.S. national or regional s
ecurities exchange on which our Common Stock is then listed or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on a U.S. national orregional securities 
exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock is then traded. If our Common Stock is not so listed or admitted fortrading, “scheduled trad
ing day” means a “business day.”“Market disruption event
” means (i) a failure by the primary U.S. national or regional securities exchange or market on which our Common Stock is listed oradmitted for trading 
to open for trading during its regular trading session or (ii) the occurrence or existence prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on anyscheduled trading day for our Com
mon Stock for more than one half-hour period in the aggregate during regular trading hours of any suspension or limitationimposed on trading (by reason of 
movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the relevant stock exchange, relevant market or otherwise) in our CommonStock or in any options contracts o
r futures contracts relating to our Common Stock.On the purchase contract se
ttlement date, our Common Stock will be issued and delivered to the holder or the holder’s designee, upon (i) surrender of certificatesrepresenting the purchas
e contracts, if such purchase contracts
are held in certificated form, and (ii) payment by the holder of any transfer or similar taxes payable in connection with the issuance of our Common Stock to anyperson other than the holder. As long 
as the purchase contracts are evidenced by one or more global purchase contract certificates deposited with DTC, proceduresfor settlement will b
e governed by DTC’s applicable procedures.If one or more of the 20 conse
cutive scheduled trading days in the valuation period is not a trading day, the purchase contract settlement date will be postponeduntil the second business day im
mediately following the last trading day of the valuation period.Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the l
ast trading day of the valuation period, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not beoutstanding, and the holder of such pu
rchase contract will not have any voting rights, rights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of ourCommon Stock by virtue of holding such purch
ase contract. The person in whose name any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon settlement of thepurchase contract on the pu
rchase contract settlement date will be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the lasttrading day of the 20 consecut
ive trading day period during which the applicable market value is determined.We will pay any documentary, s
tamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of our Common Stock upon settlement of the purchasecontracts, unless the tax 
is due because the holder requests any shares to be issued in a name other than the holder’s name, in which case the holder will pay thattax.
Early Settlement
Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the se
cond scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, any holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or anyintegral multiple thereof) or a 
holder of one or more separate purchase contracts, may elect to settle such Equity Units or separate purchase contracts early andreceive a number of shares
 of Common Stock per purchase contract equal to the “early settlement rate.” The early settlement rate is equal to the minimumsettlement rate on 
the early settlement date, subject to adjustment as described below under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates,” unless theholder elects to sett
le the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with a fundamental change, in which case the holder will receive upon settlement of theholder’s purchase contra
cts a number of shares of our Common Stock based on the “fundamental change early settlement rate” as described under “-EarlySettlement Upon a Fundamental Chang
e.” We refer to this right as the “early settlement right.”The holder’s right to rec
eive Common Stock upon early settlement of a purchase contract is subject to (i) delivery of a written and signed notice of election (an“early settlement notice”) to the 
purchase contract agent electing early settlement of such purchase contract, (ii) if such purchase contract or the Equity Unit thatincludes such purcha
se contract is held in certificated form, surrendering the certificates representing the purchase contract and (iii) payment by the holder of anytransfer or simila
r taxes payable in connection with the issuance of our Common Stock to any person other than the holder. As long as the purchase contracts or theEquity Units are evidenced by one o
r more global certificates deposited with DTC, procedures for early settlement will be governed by DTC’s applicableprocedures.
Upon surrender of the Equity Unit or th
e separate purchase contract, as applicable, and payment of any applicable transfer or similar taxes due because of any issueof such shares in a name of a p
erson other than the holder, the holder will receive the applicable number of shares of Common Stock (and any cash payable forfractional shares) du
e upon early settlement on the second business day following the “early settlement date” (as defined below).If the holder complies wi
th the requirements for effecting the early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day, then that day willbe considered the “ear
ly settlement date.” If the holder complies with such requirements at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day or at anytime on a day that is not a bus
iness day, then the next succeeding business day will be considered the “early settlement date.” Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York Citytime, on the early set
tlement date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such purchase contractwill not have any voting rights, r
ights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding such purchasecontract. The person in whose nam
e any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon such early settlement of the purchase contract will be treated as theholder of record of such shar
es as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant early settlement date.Because each Equity Unit eviden
ces a 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any early settlement of Equity Units may be madeonly in integral multip
les of 48,000 Equity Units.
Upon early settlement at the holder’s election of purchase contracts held as components of Equity Units, the custodian will deliver the U.S. treasury stripsevidenced by those Equity Units to such ho
lder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following the early settlement date.Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change
If a “fundamental ch
ange” occurs and the holder elects to settle the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with such fundamental change in accordancewith the procedures describ
ed under “-Early Settlement” above, the holder will receive per purchase contract a number of shares of our Common Stock or cash,securities or other propert
y, as applicable, equal to the “fundamental change early settlement rate,” as described below. An early settlement will be deemed forthese purposes to be “in connec
tion with” such fundamental change if the holder delivers the holder’s early settlement notice to the purchase contract agent, andotherwise satisfies the 
requirements for effecting early settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, during the period beginning on, and including, the effectivedate of the fundamenta
l change and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 35th business day thereafter (or, if earlier, the second scheduled trading dayimmediately preceding Aug
ust 16, 2023) (the “fundamental change early settlement period”). We refer to this right as the “fundamental change early settlementright.”
If the holder complies wi
th the requirements for effecting the fundamental change early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any businessday during the fun
damental change early settlement period, then that day will be considered the “fundamental change early settlement date.” If the holder complieswith such requirements at o
r after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day during the fundamental change early settlement period or at any time on aday during the fundamental 
change early settlement period that is not a business day, then the next succeeding business day will be considered the “fundamentalchange early settlement date.”
Any early settlement of Equ
ity Units in connection with a fundamental change may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.We will provide the purchas
e contract agent, custodian and the holders of Equity Units and separate purchase contracts with a notice of a fundamental changewithin five business days afte
r its effective date and issue a press release announcing such effective date. The notice will also set forth, among other things, (i) theapplicable fundament
al change early settlement rate, (ii) if not Common Stock, the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable by the holderupon settlement and (ii
i) the deadline by which each holder’s fundamental change early settlement right must be exercised.A “fundamental change” wil
l be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following:•
any “person” or “group” within th e meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), other than us,any of our wholly owned subsidiaries and any o
f our and their employee benefit plans, files a Schedule TO or any other schedule, form orreport under the Exchange Act d
isclosing that such person or group has become the direct or indirect “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of mo
re than 50% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock;•
the consummation of (A) any r ecapitalization, reclassification or change of our Common Stock (other than changes resulting from asubdivision or combination) as 
a result of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, otherproperty or assets; (B) any sha
re exchange, consolidation or merger of us pursuant to which our Common Stock will be converted into cash,securities or other prop
erty or assets; or (C) any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantiallyall of the consolidated 
assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; or•
our Common Stock (or other Common Stock re ceivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if applicable) ceases to be listed orquoted on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market 
(or any of their respective successors).A transaction or transac
tions described in either of the first two bullets above will not constitute a fundamental change, however, if (i) at least 90% of theconsideration receiv
ed or to be received by stockholders of our Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in connection with such transactionor transactions consists of sh
ares of Common Stock that are listed on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (orany of their respectiv
e successors), or will be so listed when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction or transactions and (ii) as a result of suchtransaction or transactions
 such consideration becomes the consideration receivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if applicable, excludingcash payments for frac
tional shares.
If any transaction in which our Common Stock is replaced by the securities of another entity occurs, following completion of any related fundamental change earlysettlement period (o
r, in the case of a transaction that would have been a fundamental change but for the immediately preceding paragraph, following the effectivedate of such transaction
), references to us in the definition of “fundamental change” above shall instead be references to such other entity.The “fundamental change 
early settlement rate” will be determined by us by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the fundamental changeoccurs or becomes effective (t
he “fundamental change effective date”) and the “stock price” in the fundamental change, which will be:•
in the case of a fundamen tal change described in the second bullet of the definition of “fundamental change” in which all holders of shares ofour Common Stock receive only cash 
in the fundamental change, the stock price will be the cash amount paid per share of our Common Stock;and
•
in all other cases, the s tock price will be the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock over the five consecutive tradingday period ending on the trading d
ay immediately preceding such fundamental change effective date.The stock prices set forth 
in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the fixed settlement rates are adjusted. The adjustedstock prices will equal th
e stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximumsettlement rate immediately prior to t
he adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the maximum settlement rate as soadjusted. The fundame
ntal change early settlement rates per purchase contract in the table below will be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as thefixed settlement r
ates as set forth under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”The following table 
sets forth the fundamental change early settlement rate per purchase contract for each stock price and fundamental change effective date setforth below:

fundamental change effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:•
if the applicable sto ck price is between two stock prices in the table or the applicable fundamental change effective date is between twofundamental change effective date
s in the table, the fundamental change early settlement rate will be determined by straight line interpolationbetween the fundamental c
hange early settlement rates set forth for the higher and lower stock prices and the earlier and later fundamentalchange effective da
tes, as applicable, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable;
•if the applicable sto ck price is greater than $35.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock pricesset forth in the column he
adings of the table above), then the fundamental change early settlement rate will be the minimum settlement rate; or•
if the applicable sto ck price is less than $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock prices setforth in the column hea
dings of the table above, the “minimum stock price”), the fundamental change early settlement rate will be determinedas if the stock price equ
aled the minimum stock price, and using straight line interpolation, as described in the first bullet of this paragraph, ifthe fundamental change effective
 date is between two fundamental change effective dates in the table.The maximum number of shar
es of our Common Stock deliverable under a purchase contract is 10.5263, subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the sametime as the fixed set
tlement rates as set forth under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”Our obligation to 
settle the purchase contracts at the fundamental change early settlement rate could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceabilitythereof would be subject to gen
eral principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.We will deliver the sha
res of our Common Stock, securities, cash or other property payable as a result of the holder’s exercise of the fundamental change earlysettlement right on th
e second business day following the fundamental change early settlement date. Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fundamentalchange early settle
ment date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such purchase contract willnot have any voting rights, rights 
to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding such purchase contract.The person in whose name any shares of ou
r Common Stock or other securities, if applicable, shall be issuable following exercise of a holder’s fundamentalchange early settle
ment right will be treated as the holder of record of such shares or other securities, if applicable, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on thefundamental change ea
rly settlement date.Upon early settlement of pu
rchase contracts held as components of Equity Units at the holder’s election upon a fundamental change, the custodian will deliver theU.S. treasury strips evidenced by thos
e Equity Units to such holder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following thefundamental change ea
rly settlement date.If the holder does not ele
ct to exercise the holder’s fundamental change early settlement right, the holder’s purchase contracts will remain outstanding and will besubject to normal sett
lement on any subsequent early settlement date or any subsequent fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rat
esEach fixed settlemen
t rate will be adjusted as described below, except that we will not make any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates if holders of the purchasecontracts particip
ate (other than in the case of a share split or share combination or a tender or exchange offer described in clause (5) below), at the same time andupon the same terms as holde
rs of our Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the purchase contracts, in any of the transactions described below withouthaving to settle their pu
rchase contracts as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the maximum settlement rate as of the record date for suchtransaction, 
multiplied by  (ii) the number of purch ase contracts held by such holder.(1)
If we exclusively issue shar es of our Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock, or if we effect a share split orshare combination, each 
fixed settlement rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
OS1 OS0
where,

CR0= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date (as defined below) of such dividend ordistribution, or immedi
ately prior to the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on such record date or immediately after the open of businesson such effective date, 
as applicable;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or immediatelyprior to the open of business on such e
ffective date, as applicable, before giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or sharecombination; and
OS1
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split orshare combination.
Any adjustment made under this 
clause (1) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution, orimmediately aft
er the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the typedescribed in this clause 
(1) is declared but not so paid or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board ofdirectors or a commi
ttee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend ordistribution had not been dec
lared. For the purposes of this clause (1), the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close ofbusiness on the relevant re
cord date or immediately prior to the open of business on the relevant effective date, as the case may be, and the number of shares of ourCommon Stock outstanding immedia
tely after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination shall, in each case, not include sharesthat we hold in treasury. We wi
ll not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of our Common Stock that we hold in treasury.“Effective date” 
as used in this clause (1) means the first date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the relevant stock exchange, regular way,reflecting the relevant share s
plit or share combination, as applicable.“Record date” means, with r
espect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of our Common Stock (or other applicablesecurity) have the righ
t to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which our Common Stock (or such other security) is exchanged for or converted intoany combination of cash, secu
rities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of our Common Stock (or such other security) entitled to receivesuch cash, securities or oth
er property (whether such date is fixed by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, statute, contract or otherwise).(2)
If we issue to all or substant ially all holders of our Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than45 calendar days after 
the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our Common Stock at a price per sharethat is less than the ave
rage VWAP per share of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, thetrading day immediat
ely preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on thefollowing formula:
CR1 = CR0 x
OS0 + X OS0 + Y
where,

CR0= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such issuance;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date;X
= the total number of shar es of our Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; andY
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck equal to (i) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by
 (ii) the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, thetrading day immediat
ely preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants.Any increase made under this 
clause (2) will be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effectiveimmediately aft
er the close of business on the record date for such issuance. To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to theirexpiration or shares of Common Sto
ck are not delivered after the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased to suchfixed settlement r
ate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of deliveryof only the number of shares of Com
mon Stock actually delivered, if any. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each fixed settlement rate shall beimmediately read
justed, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants to such fixedsettlement rate 
that would then be in effect if such record date for such issuance had not occurred.For the purpose of this clause (2
), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of our Common Stock to subscribe for or purchaseshares of our Common Stock at less th
an such average VWAP per share for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading dayimmediately prec
eding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of our Common Stock, thereshall be taken into accoun
t any consideration received by us for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, thevalue of such consideration, 
if other than cash, to be determined by our board of directors in good faith.(3)
If we distribute shares of ou r capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants toacquire our capital s
tock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, excluding:•
dividends, distributions or issuan ces as to which the provisions set forth in clause (1) or (2) shall apply;•
dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the provisions set forth in clause (4) below shall apply;
•any distributions upon conversion of, o r in exchange for, our Common Stock in connection with a recapitalization, reclassification,change, consolidation, merg
er or other combination, share exchange, or sale, lease or other transfer or disposition resulting in the changein the consideration due upon se
ttlement of the purchase contracts as described below under “-Recapitalizations, Reclassifications andChanges of Our Common Stock”;
•
except as otherwise descr ibed below, rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan adopted by us; and•
spin-offs as to which the provisions s et forth below in this clause (3) shall apply;then each fixed settlement rate 
will be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
SP0 SP0 - FMV
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;SP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the tradingday immediately pre
ceding the ex-date (as defined below) for such distribution; andFMV
= the fair market va lue (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness,assets, property, rights, options o
r warrants so distributed, expressed as an amount per share of our Common Stock on the ex-date forsuch distribution.
“Ex-date” means the f
irst date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without theright to receive the 
issuance, dividend or distribution in question, from us or, if applicable, from the seller of our Common Stock on such exchange or market (inthe form of due bills or oth
erwise) as determined by such exchange or market.Any increase made under the po
rtion of this clause (3) above will become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such distribution.If such distribution is not so pa
id or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committeethereof determines no
t to pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
“FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holdershall receive, in resp
ect of each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of our Common Stock, without having to settle suchpurchase contract, the 
amount and kind of our capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants to acquireour capital stock or othe
r securities that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximumsettlement rate 
in effect on the record date for the distribution.If we issue rights, options or warr
ants that are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then:
•we will not adjust the fixed se ttlement rates pursuant to the foregoing in this clause (3) until the earliest of these triggering events occurs; and•
we will readjust the fixed s ettlement rates to the extent any of these rights, options or warrants are not exercised before they expire; provided that
 the rights, options or warrants trade together with our Common Stock and will be issued in respect of future issuances of the shares of ourCommon Stock.
With respect to an adjus
tment pursuant to this clause (3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on our Common Stock of shares ofcapital stock of any cl
ass or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admittedfor trading on a U.S. national secu
rities exchange, which we refer to as a “spin-off,” each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
FMV0 + MP0 MP0
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;FMV0
= the average VWAP per share of th e capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of our Common Stock applicable toone share of our Common Stock over the 
ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the ex-date for the spin-off, or the “valuation pe
riod”; andMP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the valuation period.The increase to each f
ixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated as of the close of business on the last trading day of the valuation periodbut will be given retroac
tive effect as of immediately after the open of business on the ex-date of the spin-off. Because we will make the adjustment to each fixedsettlement rate with retroactive effect,
 we will delay the settlement of any purchase contract where any date for determining the number of shares of our CommonStock issuable to a holder occu
rs during the valuation period until the second business day after the last trading day of such valuation period. If such dividend ordistribution is not 
so paid, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not tomake or pay such dividend or dist
ribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.(4)
If any cash dividend or distr ibution is made to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, each fixed settlement rate will be adjustedbased on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x
SP0 SP0 - C
where,

CR0= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;SP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the TradingDay immediately prec
eding the ex-date for such distribution; andC
= the amount in cash per shar e we distribute to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock.Any increase made under this 
clause (4) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution. If suchdividend or distributi
on is not so paid, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereofdetermines not to make o
r pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had notbeen declared.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
“C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holder shallreceive, in respect o
f each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of our Common Stock, without having to settle suchpurchase contract, the 
amount of cash that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to the maximumsettlement rate on 
the record date for such cash dividend or distribution.(5)
If we or any of our subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for our Common Stock, to the extent that the cash andvalue of any other consider
ation included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average VWAP per share of our CommonStock over the ten consecutiv
e trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tendersor exchanges may be made pursu
ant to such tender or exchange offer, or the “expiration date”, each fixed settlement rate will be increased basedon the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x
AC + (SP1x OS1) OS0 x SP1
where,

CR0= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately prior to the close of business on the expiration date;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on the expiration date;AC
= the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) paid or payable forshares purchased in such tende
r or exchange offer;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the expiration date (prior to giving effect to the purchaseof all shares accept
ed for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);OS1
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately after the expiration date (after giving effect to the purchase of allshares accepted for pur
chase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); andSP1
= the average VWAP of our Common Stock over th e ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading daynext succeeding the expir
ation date (the “averaging period”).The increase to each f
ixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated at the close of business on the last trading day of the averaging periodbut will be given retr
oactive effect as of immediately after the close of business on the expiration date. Because we will make the adjustment to each fixedsettlement rate wi
th retroactive effect, we will delay the settlement of any purchase contracts where any date for determining the number of shares of our CommonStock issuable to a holder occu
rs during the averaging period until the second business day after the last trading day of such averaging period. For the avoidance ofdoubt, no adjustment under this c
lause (5) will be made if such adjustment would result in a decrease in any fixed settlement rate.In the event that we or one of ou
r subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but we or suchsubsidiary is permanently p
revented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each fixed settlement rate shallagain be adjusted to be such f
ixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made (or had been made only inrespect of the purchases 
that have been made and not rescinded).We may, to the extent pe
rmitted by law and the rules of NYSE or any other securities exchange on which our Common Stock or the purchase contracts is thenlisted, increase ea
ch fixed settlement rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 business days if such increase is irrevocable during such 20 business days andour board of directors (or 
a committee thereof) determines that such increase would be in our best interest. In addition, we may make such increases in each fixedsettlement rate 
as we deem advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of our Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution ofshares of our Common Stock (or issuanc
e of rights or warrants to acquire shares of our Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposesor for any other reason. We 
may only make such a discretionary adjustment if we make the same proportionate adjustment to each fixed settlement rate.Beneficial owners of the pur
chase contracts may, in certain circumstances, including upon a distribution of cash dividends to holders of our shares of CommonStock, be deemed to have rec
eived a distribution subject to U.S. federal income tax as a dividend as a result of an adjustment or the nonoccurrence of anadjustment to the fixed s
ettlement rates. See “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences.”If we have a rights plan in e
ffect upon settlement of the purchase contracts into Common Stock, the holder will receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stockreceived in connection wi
th such settlement, the rights under the rights plan. However, if, prior to any settlement, the rights have separated from the shares ofCommon Stock in accordance with th
e provisions of the applicable rights plan, each fixed settlement rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if wedistributed to all or subst
antially all holders of our Common Stock, shares of our capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options orwarrants as described in c
lause (3) above, subject to
readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. We do not currently have a stockholder rights plan in effect.Adjustments to the fixed set
tlement rates will be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of our Common Stock, and corresponding adjustments to thereference price 
and the threshold appreciation period will be calculated to the nearest $0.0001.The fixed settlement 
rate will not be adjusted:•
upon the issuance of any shares of ou r Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends orinterest payable on our se
curities and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan;•
upon the issuance of any shares of ou r Common Stock or options, rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or futurebenefit or other incen
tive plan or program of or assumed by us or any of our subsidiaries;•
subject to the second imm ediately preceding paragraph, upon the issuance of any shares of our Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant,right or exercisable, 
exchangeable or convertible security not described in the preceding bullet and outstanding as of the date the purchasecontracts were first 
issued;•
for a change in the par va lue of our Common Stock;•
for stock repurchases tha t are not tender or exchange offers referred to in clause (5) of the adjustments above, including structured or derivativetransactions or pursuant to 
a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors that is not a tender or exchange offer referred to inclause (5).
Except as otherwise provided abov
e, we will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the purchase contracts. These calculations include, but arenot limited to, deter
minations of the fundamental change early settlement rate, the stock price in connection with a fundamental change, the daily VWAP, theaverage VWAPs and the fixed sett
lement rates of the purchase contracts.We will be required, within 
ten business days after the fixed settlement rates are adjusted, to provide or cause to be provided written notice of the adjustment to theholders of the purcha
se contracts. We will also deliver to the purchase contract agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which theadjustment to each fixed 
settlement rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted fixed settlement rate.For the avoidance of doubt, if an 
adjustment is made to the fixed settlement rates, no separate inversely proportionate adjustment will be made to the referenceprice or the threshold app
reciation price because the reference price is equal to $100 divided by  the maximum settle ment rate (as adjusted in the manner describedherein) and the threshold 
appreciation price is equal to $100 divided by  the minimum settlement rate (as a djusted in the manner described herein).Whenever the terms of 
the purchase contracts require us to calculate the daily VWAP per share of our Common Stock over a span of multiple days, our board ofdirectors will make appro
priate adjustments in good faith (including, without limitation, to the applicable market value, the early settlement rate or the fundamentalchange early settlement rate (as t
he case may be)) to account for any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates (as the case may be) that become effective, or anyevent that would require such 
an adjustment if the record date, ex-date, effective date or expiration date (as the case may be) of such event occurs, during therelevant period used to
 calculate such prices or values (as the case may be).If:
•
the record date for a d ividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive trading day period usedfor calculating the applicable mar
ket value and before the purchase contract settlement date; and
•that dividend or distribut ion would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable to the holders of the purchase contracts hadsuch record date occurr
ed on or before the last trading day of such 20-trading day period,then we will deem the holders o
f the purchase contracts to be holders of record of our Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In this case, theholders of the purchase cont
racts would receive the dividend or distribution on our Common Stock together with the number of shares of our Common Stockissuable upon settlement o
f the purchase contracts.Recapitalizations, Reclassifica
tions and Changes of Our Common StockIn the event of:
•
any consolidation or merge r of us with or into another person;•
any sale, transfer, le ase or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all of our property and assets;•
any reclassificat ion of our Common Stock into securities (other than a share split or share combination), including securities other than ourCommon Stock; or
•
any statutory exchange of our s ecurities with another person (other than in connection with a consolidation or merger),in each case, as a resul
t of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cashor any combination thereo
f) (each, a “reorganization event”), each purchase contract outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization event shall, without theconsent of the holders of the pu
rchase contracts, become a contract to purchase the kind of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or anycombination thereof) 
that a holder of our Common Stock would have been entitled to receive in connection with such reorganization event (such stock, othersecurities or other prop
erty or assets (including cash or any combination thereof), the “exchange property”, with each “unit of exchange property” meaning thekind and amount of exchange prope
rty that a holder of one share of our Common Stock would have received in such reorganization event) and, prior to or at theeffective time o
f such reorganization event, we or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the purchase contract agent asupplemental agreem
ent pursuant to the purchase contract agreement and the purchase contracts to provide for such change in the right to settle the purchasecontracts.
If the transaction c
auses our Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined basedin part upon any form of stockhold
er election), the exchange property underlying the purchase contracts will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types andamounts of consideration a
ctually received by the holders of our Common Stock in such reorganization event.The number of units of exchange p
roperty we will deliver upon the settlement of each purchase contract following the effective date of such reorganization eventwill be determined as if refere
nces to our Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date, earlysettlement date or 
fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, were to units of exchange property (without interest thereon and without any rightto dividends or distributions th
ereon which have a record date prior to the date on which holders of the purchase contracts become holders of record of theunderlying shares of our Common Stock). For 
the purpose of determining which bullet of the definition of settlement rate in the second paragraph under “-Deliveryof Common Stock” will apply upon settl
ement of each purchase contract, and for the purpose of calculating the settlement rate if the second bullet is applicable, thevalue of a unit of exchange p
roperty will be determined in good faith by our board of directors (which determination will be final), except that if a unit of exchangeproperty includes Common Stock or Ame
rican Depositary Receipts, or “ADRs”, that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the value of such CommonStock or ADRs will be the average over th
e 20 consecutive trading day period used for calculating the applicable market value of the volume-weighted averageprices for such Common Stock or ADRs, as displayed on 
the applicable Bloomberg screen (as determined in good faith by our board of directors (whichdetermination will be final)); 
or, if such price is not available, the average market value per share of such
Common Stock or ADRs over such period as determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized independent investment bankingfirm retained by us for 
this purpose. The provisions of this paragraph will apply to successive reorganization events, and the provisions summarized under “-Anti-dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Se
ttlement Rates” will apply to any shares of common equity or ADRs of us or any successor received by the holders of sharesof our Common Stock in any such reorgani
zation event. We (or any successor to us) will, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five calendardays) after the occur
rence of any reorganization event provide written notice to the holders of the purchase contracts of such occurrence and of the kind andamount of cash, securiti
es or other property that constitute the exchange property. Failure to deliver such notice will not affect the operation of the provisionsdescribed in this section.
It is possible that cer
tain consolidations, mergers, combinations or other transactions could result in tax gains or losses to the holders either as a result of thetransaction or the conve
rsion thereafter. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the ownership,disposition and settlemen
t of the purchase contracts.Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of our Com
mon Stock will be issued to holders upon settlement of the purchase contracts. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable,holders will be entitled 
to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of our Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of thepurchase contracts being s
ettled (provided  that, so long as the Equity Units ar e in global form, we may elect to aggregate Equity Units for purposes of thesecalculations on any basis pe
rmitted by the applicable procedures of DTC), multiplied by the daily VWAP of our Common Stock on the trad ing day immediatelypreceding the purchase c
ontract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.Legal Holidays
In any case where the
 purchase contract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, shall not be abusiness day, notwithstanding any ter
m to the contrary in the purchase contract agreement or purchase contract, the settlement of the purchase contracts shall notbe effected on such date, bu
t instead shall be effected on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such settlement date, and nointerest or other amoun
ts shall accrue or be payable by us or to any holder in respect of such delay.Consequences of Bankruptcy
Pursuant to the terms
 of the purchase contract agreement, the purchase contract settlement date for each purchase contract, whether held separately or as part of anEquity Unit, will automatic
ally accelerate upon the occurrence of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us. Pursuant to theterms of the purchase con
tract agreement, upon acceleration, holders will be entitled under the terms of the purchase contracts to receive a number of shares of ourCommon Stock per
 purchase contract equal to the maximum settlement rate in effect immediately prior to such acceleration (regardless of the market value of ourCommon Stock at that time). Howeve
r, a bankruptcy court may prevent us from delivering our Common Stock in settlement of the accelerated purchase contracts.In such event, a holder would have a d
amage claim against us for the value of the Common Stock that we would have otherwise been required to deliver uponsettlement of the pur
chase contracts. Any such damage claim that holders have against us following such acceleration will rank pari passu with the claims of holders of our Common Stock in the re
levant bankruptcy proceeding. As such, to the extent we fail to deliver Common Stock to the holder upon such anacceleration, the ho
lder will only be able to recover damages to the extent holders of our Common Stock receive any recovery.Modification
The purchase contract ag
reement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent to modify the purchase contract agreement or the purchasecontracts without the consen
t of the holders of purchase contracts (whether held separately or as a component of Equity Units) for any of the following purposes:•
to evidence the succession o f another person to us, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants and obligations of ours in thepurchase contract agr
eement and the units and separate purchase contracts, if any;
•to add to the covenants for th e benefit of holders of purchase contracts or to surrender any of our rights or powers under the agreement;•
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment of a successor purchase contract agent;•
upon the occurrence of a r eorganization event, solely (i) to provide that each purchase contract will become a contract to purchase exchangeproperty and (ii) to ef
fect the related changes to the terms of the purchase contracts, in each case, as required by the applicable provisions ofthe purchase contract agreement;
•
to conform the provisions of th e purchase contract agreement to the “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and “Description of the EquityUnits” sections in the prel
iminary prospectus supplement which forms a part of the registration statement on which the Equity Units areregistered, as supplemen
ted by the related pricing term sheet;•
to cure any ambiguity or m anifest error, to correct or supplement any provisions that may be inconsistent or defective; and•
to make any other provisions with respect to such matters or questions, so long as such action does not adversely affect the interest of theholders in any materia
l respect.The purchase contract ag
reement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority ofthe purchase contracts 
at the time outstanding, to modify the terms of the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement. However, no such modificationmay, without the consent of the ho
lder of each outstanding purchase contract affected by the modification,•
reduce the number of shar es of Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contract (except to the extent expressly requiredpursuant to the anti-dilu
tion adjustments);•
change the purchase co ntract settlement date, or adversely modify the early settlement right or the fundamental change early settlement right;or
•
reduce the above-stat ed percentage of outstanding purchase contracts the consent of the holders of which is required for the modification oramendment of the provisions o
f the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement.In executing any modificati
on, the purchase contract agent shall be entitled to receive an opinion of counsel and an officer’s certificate stating that suchmodification is author
ized or permitted under the terms of the purchase contract agreement.Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance
Under the purchase contrac
t agreement, we are permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into another company. We are also permitted to sell, assign, transfer,lease or convey all or subst
antially all of our assets to another company. However, if we take any of these actions, we must meet the following conditions:•
the successor entity to such consolidation or merger, or the entity which acquires all or substantially all of our assets, shall expressly assume allof our obligations under the pur
chase contracts and the purchase contract agreement;•
the successor entity to such consolidation or merger, or the entity which acquires all or substantially all of our assets, shall be a corporationorganized and existing under 
the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and
•immediately aft er the merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance, no default has occurred and is continuing underthe purchase contracts or
 the purchase contract agreement.Reservation of Common Stock
We will at all tim
es reserve and keep available out of our authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance upon settlement of the purchase contracts,the number of shares of Common Stock 
that would be issuable upon the settlement of all purchase contracts then outstanding, assuming settlement at the maximumsettlement rate.

agent and the purchase contract agent will be entitled to conclusively rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without independentverification.
Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components
The U.S. treasury strips underlying th
e Equity Units are held by the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units and are subject to the terms of a custodialagreement between the 
custodian and purchase contract agent. The following summary contains a description of all of the material terms of the custodial agreementbut is not complete and is subj
ect to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the custodial agreement, including the definitions in thecustodial agreement o
f certain terms. We refer you to the custodial agreement which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Each U.S. treasury strips component wi
ll initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the businessday immediately fol
lowing the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16,2023, the holder will have the r
ight to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiples thereof), and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying thoseEquity Units. Following such separation, U.S. tre
asury strips may be transferred separately from purchase contracts.Payments of U.S. Treasury Strips
The U.S. treasury strips are held by 
the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian will, upon instructions from the purchase contractagent, forward to each holde
r of Equity Units the amount it receives from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying the Equity Unitsowned by such holder

on the business day immediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, with suchpayments commencing on, and in
cluding, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023. We expect that the amount payable per Equity Unit perfull quarter as descr
ibed in the immediately preceding sentence will be equal to $1.3750, which represents an annual rate of return on the stated amount per EquityUnit of 5.50%. The amount payable pe
r Equity Unit on August 17, 2020 was equal to $0.6875. These payments will consist of the pro rata amount of all amountsreceived by the custodian 
in respect of the U.S. treasury strips. So long as the Equity Units remain in the form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unitcertificates as d
escribed in “-Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement” below, the record date will be the business day prior to the relevant payment date. If theEquity Units do not remain in the 
form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unit certificates, the relevant record date will be the fifteenth day (whether or nota business day) prior to the r
elevant payment date.We have no obligation, responsib
ility or liability with respect to the purchase of the U.S. treasury strips and their delivery into the custody of the custodian, theperformance or non-per
formance of the duties of the custodian or any payment of the U.S. treasury strips components. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC has purchasedthe U.S. treasury strips to be sold to 
the purchasers of the Equity Units and delivered to the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.Each Equity Unit will initia
lly evidence its holder’s 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in the following U.S. treasury strips, which will constitute one U.S.treasury strips component:

The custodian is the agent of 
the holders of the Equity Units evidencing the U.S. treasury strips and is not a trustee, and no trust was intended to be created or wascreated by the terms o
f the custodial agreement. The custodian has no managerial role nor any discretion with respect to the U.S. treasury strips and has no right todeal with the U.S. treasury strips 
except as specifically provided in the custodial agreement. The custodian agrees to hold the U.S. treasury strips and exercise thedue care of a professiona
l custodian for hire. Under the custodial agreement, the custodian is required to remit all payments received from the U.S. government inrespect of the U.S. treasury st
rips to the holders of the Equity Units without making any deduction as instructed by the purchase contract agent.Ownership of U.S. Treasury Strips
The U.S. treasury strips will at a
ll times be the sole and exclusive property of the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian may not transfer, assign, pledge, setoff or otherwise dispose of any of 
the U.S. treasury strips or any interests therein, except as expressly permitted by the provisions of the custodial agreement.Withdrawal of U.S. Treasury Strips

On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will havethe right to separate su
ch Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. To withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying EquityUnits, holders must follow the proc
edures outlined under the above caption “Description of the Equity Units-Separating and Recreating Equity Units-SeparatingEquity Units.” The purchase contr
act agent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts evidenced by the Equity Units and(ii) instruct the cus
todian to deliver to the holder such holder’s U.S. treasury strips. Any administrative fees and expenses related to withdrawing the U.S. treasurystrips evidenced by the Equity Uni
ts that are payable to the purchase contract agent or the custodian will be at the expense of the holder of Equity Units requestingwithdrawal. To recreate 
the Equity Units, holders must follow the procedures outlined under the above caption “Description of the Equity Units-Separating andRecreating Equity Units-Recr
eation of Equity Units.” Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasurystrips, any separation or r
ecreation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.Certain Other Provisions of the Custodial Agreem
entDelivery of U.S. Treasury Strips
Payments of the U.S. treasury strips 
components will be made by the custodian to the depositary as long as the Equity Units remain in book-entry form. Inaddition, if the Equity Units do not 
remain in book-entry form, payments may be made, at the option of the custodian, by check mailed to the address of the personentitled to the paymen
ts as shown on the Equity Unit register.If the purchase contra
ct settlement date is accelerated, U.S. treasury strips will be delivered by the custodian upon presentation and surrender of the Equity Unitcertificates ev
idencing the related Equity Units at the office of the purchase contract agent or, in the case of book-entry Equity Units, upon presentation andsurrender of the Equity Units in 
accordance with the procedures of the depositary. Following such acceleration and delivery, the custodian will sell (or, at theexpense of holders, retain 
the services of a broker dealer that will sell) such U.S. treasury strips, and the custodian will distribute the net cash proceeds of such sale(less any expenses incurred by 
the custodian in connection with such sale) on a pro rata basis to holders of Equity Units (or in accordance with the procedures ofthe depositary in the cas
e of global Equity Units). Until the Equity Unit certificate is presented and surrendered or the holder provides satisfactory evidence that theEquity Unit certifica
te has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the purchase contract agent, the U.S. treasury stripswill be held by the custodian fo
r the account of the holder. The custodian will have no obligation to invest or to pay interest on any amounts held by the custodianpending delivery.
Modification
The custodial agreemen
t contains provisions prohibiting the custodian and the purchase contract agent, except under limited circumstances, from modifying oramending the terms of th
e custodial agreement without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Equity Unit affected by the modification or amendment.Governing Law
The custodial agreemen
t is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.Information Concerning the Custodian
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., whose designated off
ice is located at 400 South Hope Street, Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90071, acts as thecustodian of the U.S. treasury str
ips on behalf of the holders of Equity Units from time to time.The custodial agreemen
t does not obligate the custodian to perform any discretionary actions in connection with the terms of the Equity Units or the custodialagreement. The custodia
l agreement also contains provisions limiting the liability of the custodian and the circumstances under which the custodian may resign orbe replaced. No such resignat
ion or replacement will be effective until a successor custodian is appointed.We maintain banking re
lationships in the ordinary course of business with the custodian and its affiliates.Book Entry Procedures and Settlement

Except in the limited circumstances described herein, the Equity Units and the purchase contracts are issued in the form of one or more global Equity Unitcertificates and global purcha
se contract certificates, respectively, held by the purchase contract agent, as custodian for, and registered in the name of, TheDepository Trust Company (“DTC”), as deposit
ary, or its nominee.The depositary has advised us as fo
llows: The depositary is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York, amember of the Federal Res
erve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency”registered pursuant to Sec
tion 17A of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The depositary was created to hold securities of itsparticipants (defined belo
w) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entrychanges in accounts 
of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. The depositary’s participants include securities brokersand dealers, banks, trust comp
anies, clearing corporations and some other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own the depositary. Accessto the depositary’s book-ent
ry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodialrelationship with a part
icipant, either directly or indirectly.No Equity Unit represented by global Equ
ity Unit certificates and no purchase contract represented by global purchase contract certificates may be exchanged inwhole or in part for defini
tive Equity Units or purchase contracts, as the case may be, and no transfer of global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contractcertificates in whol
e or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the depositary or any nominee of the depositary unless:•
the depositary has notifi ed the purchase contract agent that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such global Equity Unitcertificates or g
lobal purchase contract certificates, as the case may be, or has ceased to be qualified to act as such as required by the purchasecontract agreement;
•
there shall have occur red and be continuing a default by us in respect of our obligations under the purchase contract agreement; or•
the beneficial holde r of Equity Units elects to withdraw the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by one or more of its Equity Units and elects to holdthe purchase contracts 
in definitive form.All Equity Units and purchase contr
acts represented by one or more global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates, respectively, or anyportion thereof are r
egistered in such names as the depositary may have directed.The laws of some jurisdictions 
require that some purchasers of Equity Units take physical delivery of the Equity Units in definitive form. These laws may impair aholder’s ability to tr
ansfer beneficial interests in Equity Units so long as they are represented by global Equity Unit certificates.As long as the depositary (or its no
minee) is the registered owner of the global Equity Unit certificates and the global purchase contract certificates, the depositary(or its nominee) will be 
considered the sole owner and holder of the global Equity Unit certificates, the global purchase contract certificates and all Equity Unitsand purchase contracts r
epresented thereby for all purposes under the Equity Units and purchase contracts and the purchase contract agreement. Except in thelimited circumstances referred to ab
ove, owners of beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates and owners of beneficial interests in global purchasecontract certificates:
•
are not be entitled to ha ve the global purchase contract certificates or the purchase contracts represented thereby registered in their respectivenames;
•
will not receive or be e ntitled to receive physical delivery of Equity Unit certificates or purchase contract certificates, as the case may be, inexchange therefor; and
•
are not be considered to be owne rs or holders of global Equity Unit certificates or any Equity Units represented thereby or global purchasecontract certif
icates or any purchase contracts represented thereby, for any purpose under the Equity Units, the purchase contracts or thepurchase contract agreement.

All transfers and deliveries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by us in lieu of fractional shares) issued on settlement of the purchasecontracts evidenced by th
e Equity Units in global form and all transfers and deliveries of the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units in global form willbe made to the depositary 
(or its nominee) as the holder thereof. All transfers and deliveries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by us inlieu of fractional shares) p
ursuant to the purchase contracts represented by the global purchase contract certificates will be made by the purchase contract agent tothe depositary (or its nom
inee) as the holder thereof. Cash payments in respect of the U.S. treasury strips component of Equity Units in global form will be madeby the custodian, at the dir
ection of the purchase contract agent, to the depositary (or its nominee) as the holder of such Equity Units.Ownership of beneficial int
erests in the global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates is limited to participants or persons that may holdbeneficial inter
ests through institutions that have accounts with the depositary or its nominee, which we refer to as participants. Ownership of beneficial interests inglobal Equity Unit certif
icates and global purchase contract certificates will be shown only on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected onlythrough, records maintain
ed by the depositary or its nominee (with respect to participants’ interests) or any such participant (with respect to interests of personsheld by such participants on th
eir behalf). Procedures for settlement of purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date or upon early settlement forholders who hold in book-entry form wil
l be governed by arrangements among the depositary, participants and persons that may hold beneficial interests throughparticipants designed to
 permit such settlement without the physical movement of certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries, exchanges and other matters relatingto beneficial inte
rests in global Equity Unit certificates may be subject to various policies and procedures adopted by the depositary from time to time. None ofPG&E Corporation, the purchase contr
act agent or the custodian or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of thedepositary’s or any parti
cipant’s records relating to, or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates or global purchasecontract certif
icates, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the depositary’s records or any participant’s records relating to such beneficial ownershipinterests.
Notices
So long as the global securiti
es are held on behalf of DTC or any other clearing system, notices to holders of securities represented by a beneficial interest in theglobal securities may b

Interest  Rates; LIBOR Notification.  The interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined by reference to theEurodollar
 Base Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR ”).  LIBOR is intended to representthe
 rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. OnMarch
 5, 2021, the FCA publicly announced that: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of all seven euroLIBOR
 settings, all seven Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month Japanese Yen LIBORsettings,
 the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings, and the 1-week and 2-monthU.S.
 Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S.
 Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after December 31, 2021, the 1-month, 3-month and6-month
 Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings willcease
 to be provided or, subject to consultation by the FCA, be provided on a changed methodology (or “synthetic”) basisand
 no  longer  be  representative  of  the  underlying  market  and  economic  reality  they  are  intended  to  measure  and  thatrepresentativeness will
 not be restored; and immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3- month and 6-month U.S. DollarLIBOR
 settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA’s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basisand
 no  longer  be  representative  of  the  underlying  market  and  economic  reality  they  are  intended  to  measure  and  thatrepresentativeness
 will not be restored. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that theadministrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further

 is  published.  Each  party  to  this  agreement  should  consult  its  own  advisors  to  stay  informed  of  any  suchdevelopments.
 Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative referencerates

 have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to LIBOR or other rates inthe
 definition  of  “Eurodollar  Base  Rate”  or  with  respect  to  any  alternative  or  successor  rate  thereto,  or  replacement  ratethereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to 
Section 2.13(b)
 or (c),  whether  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Benchmark  Transition  Event  or  an  Early  Opt-In  Election,  and  (ii)  theimplementation
 of  any  Benchmark  Replacement  Conforming  Changes  pursuant  to Section  2.13(d)),  including  withoutlimitation,

 Tranche Loans (Tranche B) on or prior to the 18-Month Tranche Maturity Date for such Loans) shall be made pro rata
 (i) in the case of the 364-Day Tranche Loans, according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the 364-Day
 Tranche  Loans  then  held  by  the  364-Day  Tranche  Lenders  and  (ii)  in  the  case  of  the  18-Month  Tranche  Loans,according
 to  the  respective  outstanding  principal  amounts  of  the  18-Month  Tranche  Loans  then  held  by  the  18-MonthTranche Lenders.
(c)
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  all  payments  (including  prepayments)  to  be  made  by  theBorrower
 hereunder,  whether  on  account  of  principal,  interest,  fees  or  otherwise,  shall  be  made  without  setoff  orcounterclaim
 and shall be made prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the AdministrativeAgent,
 for the account of the Lenders, as applicable, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.The Administrative Agent shall dis
tribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. Ifany

 payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loanbecomes
 due  and  payable  on  a  day  other  than  a  Business  Day,  the  maturity  thereof  shall  be  extended  to  the  nextsucceeding
 Business  Day  unless  the  result  of  such  extension  would  be  to  extend  such  payment  into  another  calendarmonth,
 in  which  event  such  payment  shall  be  made  on  the  immediately  preceding  Business  Day.  In  the  case  of  anyextension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then
applicable rate during such extension.
(d)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing thatsuch
 Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the AdministrativeAgent,
 the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the AdministrativeAgent,
 and  the  Administrative  Agent  may,  in  reliance  upon  such  assumption,  make  available  to  the  Borrower  acorresponding
 amount.  If  such  amount  is  not  made  available  to  the  Administrative  Agent  by  the  required  time  on  theEffective Date, such Lender shall pay
 to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rateequal
 to  the  greater  of  (i)  the  Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate  and  (ii)  a  rate  determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  inaccordance
 with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amountimmediately
 available  to  the  Administrative  Agent.  A  certificate  of  the  Administrative  Agent  submitted  to  any  Lenderwith
 respect  to  any  amounts  owing  under  this  paragraph  shall  be  conclusive  in  the  absence  of  manifest  error.  If  suchLender’s share of
 such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three BusinessDays after
 the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereonat the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans from the Borrower within 30 days after written demand therefor.

(e)Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of anypayment
 due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the AdministrativeAgent,
 the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agentmay,
 but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata 
shares  of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower withinthree
 Business  Days  after  such  due  date,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  recover,  on  demand,  from  eachLender
 to which  any amount which was made available  pursuant  to the preceding  sentence,  such amount with interestthereon
 at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed tolimit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
(f)
The  Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower willpromptly
 execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a “Note ”)  of the Borrower evidencing any Loans (or anyportion thereof)
 of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit H, with appropriate insertions as to date and principalamount; 
provided ,  that delivery of Notes shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Effective Date or themaking of the Loans on the Effective Date.
(g)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.14(d), then theAdministrative
 Agent  may,  in  its  discretion  and  notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  hereof,  (i)  apply  any  amountsthereafter
 received  by  the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  for  the  account  of  such  Lender  for  the  benefit  of  theAdministrative
 Agent to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, under suchSection
 until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, holdany
 such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of suchLender
 under  any  such  Section,  in  the  case  of  each  of  clauses  (i)  and  (ii)  above,  in  any  order  as  determined  by  theAdministrative Agent in its discretion.
1.3
Change of Law . (a)
If a Change of Law shall:Section 16.
subject any  Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d)of
 the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves,other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
Section
 17.impose,  modify  or  hold  applicable  any  reserve,  special  deposit,  compulsory  loan,  Federal  Deposit  InsuranceCorporation
 insurance  charge  or  other  similar  insurance  charge  or  similar  requirement  against  assets  held  by,  deposits  or  otherliabilities
 in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lenderthat
 is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate, which requirements are generally applicable to advances,loans and other extensions of credit made by such Lender; or

Section 18.impose  on any Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender or participationstherein;
and
 the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lenderor
 such other Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining  the Loans, or to reduce anyamount
 receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such otherRecipient,
 within ten Business Days after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such otherRecipient
 for  such  increased  cost  or  reduced  amount  receivable.  If  any  Lender  or  other  Recipient  becomes  entitled  to  claim  anyadditional amount
s pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of theevent by
 reason of which it has become so entitled; provided , however, that  no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled to demandsuch
 compensation more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made or(y)
 the repayment of the Loan in respect of which such demand is made. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lendershall demand
 compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender todemand
 such compensation from similarly situated borrowers (to the extent that such Lender has the right to do so under its creditfacilities with similarly situated borrowers).
(a)
If any Lender shall have determined that a Change of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements shallhave
 the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or the capital of any corporation controlling suchLender
 as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation couldhave
 achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such corporation’s policies withrespect to capital
 adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, aftersubmission
 by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, theBorrower
 shall  pay  to  such  Lender  such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as  will  compensate  such  Lender  or  suchcorporation for such reduction.
(b)
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender orany
 other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence ofsuch costs or amounts. Notwith
standing anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be required tocompensate
 a Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any amounts incurred more than six monthsprior to
 the date that such Lender or such other Recipient notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s or such other Recipient’sintention
 to claim compensation therefor; provided  that,  if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactiveeffect,
 then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelvemonths.
 The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination ofthis Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder.
1.2
Taxes . (a)
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall bemade without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any

applicable laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or Administrative Agent making the payment)require
 the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (A) the Borrower or Administrative Agent,as applicable shall withhold or make such
 deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to berequired, (B) the Borrower or Administrative Agent, as applicable shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to
the relevant Governmenta
l Authority in accordance with such laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deductionis
 made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that afterany
 required  withholding  or  the  making  of  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to  additional  sumspayable
 under this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received hadno such withholding or deduction been made.
(b)
Without  limiting  the  provisions  of  subsection  (a)  above,  the  Borrower  shall  timely  pay  to  the  relevantGovernmental
 Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburseit for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

or
 asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or required tobe
 withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respectthereto,
 whether  or  not  such  Indemnified  Taxes  were  correctly  or  legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevantGovernmental Auth
ority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lenderor

 to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to theBorrower
 pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable netafter-Tax
 position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise tosuch refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the

indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (f) shall notbe construed to require any Recipient to make availa
ble its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that itdeems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

 an Interest Period with respect thereto. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to theBorrower
 by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive for 90 days afterthe termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Change  of  Lending  Office.  Each  Lender  agrees  that,  upon  the  occurrence  of  any  event  giving  rise  to  theoperation
 of Section 2.15 or 2.16 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts(subject
 to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by suchevent
 with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, inthe
 sole  but  reasonable  judgment  of  such  Lender,  cause  such  Lender  and  its  lending  office(s)  to  suffer  no  unreimbursedeconomic disadvantage
 or any legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affector postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16.

 pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be awaiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
1.5

 and sixth ,  to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; providedthat
 if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of the Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has notfully
 funded its appropriate share such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders ona pro
 rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepaymentsor

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of anypayment
 due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the AdministrativeAgent,
 the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agentmay, but shall not be
41
        

required  to,  in  reliance  upon  such  assumption,  make  available  to  the  Lenders  their  respective pro  rata shares  of  acorresponding

(g)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.14(d), then theAdministrative
 Agent  may,  in  its  discretion  and  notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  hereof,  (i)  apply  any  amountsthereafter
 received  by  the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  for  the  account  of  such  Lender  for  the  benefit  of  theAdministrative
 Agent to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, under suchSection
 until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, holdany
 such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of suchLender
 under  any  such  Section,  in  the  case  of  each  of  clauses  (i)  and  (ii)  above,  in  any  order  as  determined  by  theAdministrative Agent in its discretion.

subject any  Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d)of
 the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves,other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
Section
 16.impose,  modify  or  hold  applicable  any  reserve,  special  deposit,  compulsory  loan,  Federal  Deposit  InsuranceCorporation
 insurance  charge  or  other  similar  insurance  charge  or  similar  requirement  against  assets  held  by,  deposits  or  otherliabilities
 in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lenderthat
 is  not  otherwise  included  in  the  determination  of  the Eurodollar Term  Benchmark Rate,  which  requirements  are  generallyapplicable to advances, loans and other extensions of credit made by such Lender; or
Section 17.
impose  on any Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender or participationstherein;
and
 the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lenderor such other Recipient deems to be material,
42
        

of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining the Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof,then,
 in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient, within ten Business Days after itsdemand,
 any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for such increased cost or reducedamount
 receivable. If any Lender or other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, itshall
 promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become soentitled; 
provided , however,  that no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 daysfollowing (x)

If any Lender shall have determined that a Change of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements shallhave
 the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or the capital of any corporation controlling suchLender
 as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation couldhave
 achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such corporation’s policies withrespect to capital
 adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, aftersubmission
 by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, theBorrower
 shall  pay  to  such  Lender  such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as  will  compensate  such  Lender  or  suchcorporation for such reduction.
(b)
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender orany
 other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence ofsuch costs or amounts. Notwith
standing anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be required tocompensate
 a Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any amounts incurred more than six monthsprior to
 the date that such Lender or such other Recipient notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s or such other Recipient’sintention
 to claim compensation therefor; provided  that,  if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactiveeffect,
 then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelvemonths.
 The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination ofthis Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder.
1.2
Taxes . (a)
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall bemade
 without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable laws (asdetermined
 in  the  good  faith  discretion  of  the  Borrower  or  Administrative  Agent  making  the  payment)  require  thededuction
 or  withholding  of  any  Tax  from  any  such  payment,  then  (A)  the  Borrower  or  Administrative  Agent,  asapplicable

(B)  the  Borrower  or  Administrative  Agent,  as  applicable  shall  timely  pay  the  full  amount  withheld  or  deducted  to  therelevant
 Governmental Authority in accordance with such laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction ismade
 on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after anyrequired withholding
 or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payableunder
 this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no suchwithholding or deduction been made.
(b)
Without  limiting  the  provisions  of  subsection  (a)  above,  the  Borrower  shall  timely  pay  to  the  relevantGovernmental
 Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburseit for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

 whether  or  not  such  Indemnified  Taxes  were  correctly  or  legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevantGovernmental Auth
ority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lenderor

x ) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extentthat

 of the Borrower to do so), (y ) the Administrative Agent against any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to complywith
 the  provisions  of  Section  10.6(c)(iii)  relating  to  the  maintenance  of  a  Participant  Register  and  (z )  the  Administrative Agentagainst
 any  Excluded  Taxes  attributable  to  such  Lender,  in  each  case,  that  are  payable  or  paid  by  the  Administrative  Agent  inconnection
 with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not suchTaxes
 were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of suchpayment
 or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lenderhereby
 authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, as the casemay
 be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause(ii).

 documentation set forth in Sections 2.16(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’sreasonable
 judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursedcost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(a)
At no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of aLender,
 any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender, as the case may be. Ifany

 indemnified  party  is  required  to  repay  such  refund  or  credit  to  such  Governmental  Authority.  Notwithstandinganything
 to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to theBorrower
 pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable netafter-Tax
 position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise tosuch
 refund  or  credit  had  not  been  deducted,  withheld  or  otherwise  imposed  and  the  indemnification  payments  oradditional
 amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (f) shall not be construed to require anyRecipient
 to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to theBorrower or any other Person.

Term Benchmark  Loans  on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. A certificateas
 to  any  amounts  payable  pursuant  to  this  Section  submitted  to  the  Borrower  by  any  Lender  shall  be  conclusive  in  theabsence of manifest error. This coven
ant shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment ofthe Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
1.3
Change  of  Lending  Office.  Each  Lender  agrees  that,  upon  the  occurrence  of  any  event  giving  rise  to  theoperation
 of Section 2.15 or 2.16 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts(subject
 to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by suchevent
 with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, inthe
 sole  but  reasonable  judgment  of  such  Lender,  cause  such  Lender  and  its  lending  office(s)  to  suffer  no  unreimbursedeconomic disadvantage

 competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’sbreach
 of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment ofany
 amounts  owing  to  the  Borrower  as  a  result  of  any  judgment  of  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  obtained  by  theBorrower

 Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest isdetermined by
 reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, orany
 Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or totake
 deposits  of,  Dollars  in  the  London  interbank  market,  then,  upon  notice  thereof  by  such  Lender  to  the  Borrower(through
 the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convertABR
 Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making ormaintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the ABR,
the
 interest  rate  on  which  ABR  Loans  of  such  Lender  shall,  if  necessary  to  avoid  such  illegality,  be  determined  by  theAdministrative
 Agent  without  reference  to  the  Eurodollar  Rate  component  of  the  ABR,  in  each  case  until  such  Lendernotifies
 the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.Upon
 receipt  of  such  notice,  (i)  the  Borrower  shall,  upon  demand  from  such  Lender  (with  a  copy  to  the  AdministrativeAgent), prepay
 or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABRLoans
 of  such  Lender  shall,  if  necessary  to  avoid  such  illegality,  be  determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  withoutreference
 to  the  Eurodollar  Rate  component  of  the  ABR),  either  on  the  last  day  of  the  Interest  Period  therefor,  if  suchLender
 may  lawfully  continue  to  maintain  such  Eurodollar  Loans  to  such  day,  or  immediately,  if  such  Lender  may  notlawfully
 continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determiningor
 charging  interest  rates  based  upon  the  Eurodollar  Rate,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  during  the  period  of  suchsuspension
 compute the ABR applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof untilthe
 Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine orcharge interest rates based upon the Eurodolla
r Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also payaccrued
 interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section2.17.

Change in ControlIn  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control,  the  surviving,  continuing,  successor,  or  purchasingcorporation
 or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror” ), may,without
 your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  PG&E  Corporation’s  rights  and  obligationsunder
 this  Agreement  or  provide  a  substantially  equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  theRestricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement.
If
 the Restricted Stock Units are neither so assumed nor so continued by the Acquiror, and theAcquiror
 does  not  provide  a  substantially  equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  the  RestrictedStock
 Units,  all  of  your  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  vest  immediately  preceding  andcontingent
 on,  the  Change  in  Control  and  be  settled  in  accordance  with  the  Normal  VestingSchedule, subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.
Termination In Connection
with a Change in Control
If  you  separate  from  service  (other  than  termination  for  cause,  your  voluntary  termination,  oryour

 Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed) subject to the earliersettlement provisions of this Agreement.
In
 the  event  of  such  a  separation  in  connection  with  a  Change  in  Control  within  two  yearsfollowing
 the  Change  in  Control,  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  (to  the  extent  they  did  notpreviously
 vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) willvest

 to  comply  with  Code  Section  409A(a)(2)(B)(i)  (relating  to  payments made  to  certain“key
 employees”  of  certain  publicly-traded  companies);  in  such  event,  any  shares  of  commonstock
 to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the dateof
 your  “separation  from  service”  under  Section  409A  (or  shorter  period  ending  on  the  date  ofyour

Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return toservice
 upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will bedeemed

 settled hereunder upon such separation. To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due toa
 medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death orto
 last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such impairment causes you to beunable

Stock Options
What is a stock option?
A
 stock option allows you to buy a certain number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock at a fixed price. The per sharepurchase
 price (or exercise price) generally will be equal to the closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock on the date on which theoption is granted, unless otherwise specified in your award agreement.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of a stock option?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that the grant of stock options would be made in recognition of your service to PG&E Corporation (or anyof
 its  subsidiaries)  and  would  not  require  any  cash  payment.  To  purchase  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock  underlying  a  stock  option,however, you must exercise the stock option and pay the exercise price as described below and set forth in your award agreement.
When may I exercise my stock options?
You
 may not exercise your stock options until your right to do so has vested in accordance with the vesting terms that are determinedwhen
 the stock options are granted and set forth in your award agreement governing your stock options. Vesting is generally contingent onyour
 continued  service  to  PG&E  Corporation  or  its  affiliates  through  the  applicable  vesting  date.  Stock  options  may  also  be  subject  toperformance-based
 vesting measures that affect the number of options that you ultimately may be permitted to exercise. Please consult youraward agreement for details regarding the vesting terms of your stock options.
How do I exercise my stock options?
You must deliver a completed electronic exercise election form to the record-keeper for the LTIP, which is currently Charles Schwab.
Instructions for completing and submitting the form are available from the recordkeeper.
What happens if my service with PG&E Corporation ends before my stock option is fully vested and exercisable?
The award
 agreement describes what happens to the stock option if your service terminates before the stock option is fully vested andexercisable.
 In general, upon termination of service with PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeit all unvested stockoptions.
When do my stock options expire?
Although
 the term of an option may vary, in general, the term of each stock option is 10 years, unless otherwise specified in youraward agreement. The options generally will expire earlier upon or within a specified period following your termination of service.
Do I have any shareholder rights?
You will
 not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares subject to the options unless an option is exercised and sharesare issued to you.
v

How do I pay for shares and taxes upon exercise of my stock options?Unless
 your award agreement provides otherwise, you may pay the option exercise price and applicable tax withholdings using (1)cash, check
 or cash equivalent; (2) shares of PG&E Corporation common stock; (3) a "cashless exercise" procedure (whereby a broker sells anumber
 of shares purchased upon exercise, with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholdings and remits thesale proceeds
 to PG&E Corporation to pay for the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholdings); (4) by surrendering a number ofshares
 of PG&E Corporation common stock that otherwise would have been issued to you in connection with the stock option exercise, withan
 aggregate fair market value (as determined as of the business day before the date of exercise) equal to the aggregate exercise price andapplicable
 tax withholdings, (5) by another method that pay be approved by the Committee or (6) any combination of the foregoing. If sharesare
 used to pay all or part of the exercise price, the cash and any shares surrendered must have a fair market value (determined as of thebusiness day before the date of exercise) that is not less than the applicable exercise price.
How is an incentive stock option different than a nonqualified stock option?    
An
 incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option have different U.S. federal tax consequences, which are explained in moredetail in the “
Tax Consequences ” section  below. Each stock option will be designated by the Committee as either an incentive stock option ora
 nonqualified stock option and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing the grant. If an option granted as an incentive stock option failsto qualify as an incentive stock option under the Code, it will be treated as a nonqualified stock option.
Stock Appreciation Rights
What is a stock appreciation right?
 
   A  stock  appreciation right  (SAR) gives  you the  right  to receive  an amount  equal  to the  excess of  the fair  market  value of  a share  ofcommon
 stock of PG&E Corporation on the date of exercise over a fixed value (the “Base Price”) of the SAR. A SAR may be settled in[shares
 of common stock, cash, or any combination thereof] as specified by the Committee. The Base Price of a SAR granted under the LTIPwill not be less than the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject to the SAR on the date the SAR is granted.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of stock appreciation rights?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that SARs would be granted in recognition of your service to PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries)and would not require any cash payment.
When may I exercise my SARs?
You
 may not exercise your SARs until your right to do so has vested in accordance with the vesting terms that are determined whenthe
 SARs are granted and set forth in your award agreement governing your SARs. Vesting is generally contingent on your continued serviceto
 PG&E Corporation or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date. SARs may also be subject to performance-based vesting measuresthat
 affect the number of SARs that you ultimately may be permitted to exercise. Please consult your award agreement for details regardingthe vesting terms of your SARs.
How do I exercise my SARs?
 
   You must deliver a completed electronic exercise election form to the record-keeper for the LTIP, currently Charles Schwab. Instructionsfor completing and submitting the form are available from the recordkeeper
What happens if my service with PG&E Corporation terminates before my stock appreciation right vests?
 
   The award agreement describes what happens to the SARs if your service terminates before the SARs are fully vested and exercisable. Ingeneral upon termination of service with PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeit all unvested SARs.

Do I have any shareholder rights?

Restricted Stock
What is a restricted stock award?
    A restricted stock award is a grant of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that is subject to vesting.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of restricted stock?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that restricted stock awards would be granted in recognition of your service to the PG&E Corporation (orany
 of its subsidiaries) and would not require any cash payment. However, in setting the terms of the grant, the Committee has the discretionto require payment.
When will restricted stock awards vest?
    
In order for your restricted stock awards to vest, you must generally remain in the service of PG&E Corporation during the vesting period.Vesting may also be
 contingent upon the achievement of specified performance conditions and/or such other terms and conditions determinedby
 the Committee. Restricted stock awards that are subject to performance-based vesting terms are referred to as Performance Shares in theLTIP,
 and  also  may  be  called  performance  share  units.  The  vesting  terms  of  a  restricted  stock  award  will  be  set  forth  in  your  awardagreement.
What happens to restricted stock awards if my service with PG&E Corporation terminates before my Award vests?
 
   The award agreement describes what happens to the restricted stock award if your service terminates before the restricted stock award isfully
 vested and transferable. In general upon termination of service with the PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeitall unvested restricted stock awards.
When will restricted stock awards be settled?
    
When restrictions on  the restricted stock award lapse  (i.e., you vest) and you  satisfy any other conditions imposed  by the Committeepursuant to the LTIP or your award agreement, you will become the owner of unrestricted shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation.
Do I have any shareholder rights?
    
 Unless otherwise provided in your award agreement, you will have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to restricted stock duringthe
 applicable restricted period, including the right to receive payment of dividends and distributions with respect to the underlying shares ofPG&E Corporation common stock (which will be subject to the same vesting terms as the underlying shares of common stock).
Restricted Stock Units

A
 restricted stock unit is a right to receive shares of PG&E Corporation common stock when the restricted stock units are settledfollowing vesting. PG&E Corporation common stock is not issued at the time of grant of a restricted stock unit award.
vii

Will I be required to pay for a grant of restricted stock units?Generally,
 no.  It  is  anticipated  that  restricted  stock  unit  awards  would  be  granted  in  recognition  of  your  service  to  the  PG&ECorporation
 (or any of its subsidiaries) and would not require any cash payment. However, in setting the terms of the grant, the Committeehas the discretion to require payment.
When will restricted stock units vest?
In
 order for your restricted stock awards to vest, you must generally remain in the service of PG&E Corporation during the vestingperiod.
 Vesting may also be contingent upon the achievement of specified performance conditions and/or such other terms and conditionsdetermined
 by  the  Committee.  Restricted  stock  unit  awards  that  are  subject  to  performance-based  vesting  terms  are  referred  to  asPerformance Shares in the LTIP. The vesting terms of a restricted stock award will be set forth in your award agreement.
What happens to restricted stock unit awards if my service with PG&E Corporation terminates before the scheduled vesting date?
 
   Your award agreement describes what happens to the restricted stock unit if your service terminates before the scheduled vesting date. Ingeneral,
 upon termination of service with the PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeit all unvested restricted stockunits.
Will I receive dividends on restricted stock units?
The
 Committee  may  provide  in  an  award  agreement  that  you  will  be  entitled  to  receive  dividend  equivalents  with  respect  to  thepayment
 of cash dividends, which, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, will be credited to you in the form of additional wholerestricted
 stock  units  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  such  cash  dividends  on  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock.  The  number  of  additionalrestricted stock
 units (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be credited shall be determined by dividing the amount of cash dividends paidon
 such date with respect to the number of shares of common stock represented by the restricted stock units previously granted to you, by thefair
 market  value  of  a  share  of  common  stock  on  such  date.  Settlement  of  dividend  equivalents  will  be  made  in  the  same  manner  as  therestricted stock units, which may include cash, shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation or a combination thereof.
How soon will I receive the shares after the restricted stock units have vested?     
PG&E Corporation will generally
 issue shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in respect of your restricted stock units within 60days after
 the restricted stock units vest but no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which any applicable performance periodends
 or at such other times as set forth in your award agreement. However, the Committee may also settle restricted stock units in cash or acombination of cash and shares of common stock.
PG&E
 Corporation  will  delay  the  issuance  of  any  shares  of  common  stock  to  the  extent  it  is  necessary  to  comply  with  Section409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
 (relating to payments made to certain “key employees” of certain publicly-traded companies). In such event, any shares ofcommon
 stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six-month period following the date of your “separation from service”under
 Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the first businessday following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
Do I have the same rights as other shareholders?
You
 will not have voting rights with respect to the restricted stock units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidencedby appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
Performance Awards
What are performance awards?
Performance
 awards may  be in the form of  Performance Shares or Performance Units  (each as may be described  above) and areawards
 that  are  eligible  to  vest  based  on  the  achievement  of  performance  measures  at  the  end  of  a  pre-established  performance  period(“Performance Period”), as set forth in your
viii

award  agreement.  Participants  may  receive  one  or  more  grants  of  performance  awards,  and  each  grant  may  reference  one  or  moreperformance measures.
What are the performance measures and how do they work?
    A description of the applicable performance measures and how they work can be found in your award agreement.
When will performance awards vest?
Except
 as otherwise set forth in your ward agreement, vesting will occur following the Committee’s certification of the extent towhich
 the performance goals applicable to each type of performance measure are achieved. Certification will occur after the completion ofthe relevant Performance Period.
Termination of Service
What happens
 to stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards if my service is terminated?In
 general,  and  unless  otherwise  specified  in  your  award  agreement,  upon  your  voluntary  termination  of  service  with  PG&ECorporation (other than retirement, if
 provided for in your award agreement), your termination of service with or without cause, or your deathor
 disability, you will forfeit (1) any awards that have not yet vested and (2) any associated accrued dividends. Vested options generally mustbe exercised within 30 days or the remaining term of the stock options, whichever is shorter.
What happens to my stock options, SARS, restricted stock, performance awards, and restricted stock units if I retire?
If applicable, your award agreement will provide for the treatment of awards in the case of retirement.
Change in Control
What
 happens to stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards if there is a “change incontrol” of PG&E Corporation?
In general, and
 unless otherwise specified in your award agreement, in the event of a “change in control” (as defined in the LTIP), thesurviving,
 continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (“Acquiror”), may,without
 your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  your  outstanding  award  or  the  Acquiror  may  provide  substantially  equivalent  awards  insubstitution for those awards.
In
 general, and unless otherwise specified in your award agreement, if the Acquiror does  not assume  or continue your outstandingaward
 or if the Acquiror does not provide substantially equivalent awards, then your awards will become fully vested, and your options andSARs become exercisable immediately prior to the “change in control.”
What
 happens to my award if my service is terminated other than for cause in connection with a “change in control” of PG&ECorporation?
Your
 award agreement describes what happens to your award upon termination of your service by PG&E Corporation other than forcause in connection with a “change in control.”
What would be considered a “change in control” of PG&E Corporation?
The LTIP defines the term “change in control.” A change in control of PG&E Corporation occurs when:
•
Any person becomes the beneficial owner of securities of PG&E Corporation representing 30% or more of the combined voting power ofPG&E Corporation’s then outstanding securities;
ix

•If  during  any  two  consecutive  years  the  directors  at  the  beginning  of  the  two-year  period  cease  to  be  a  majority  of  the  Board  ofDirectors
 at the end of the period, unless the election, or the nomination for election by the shareholders, of each new director wasapproved
 by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who were either (a) directors at the beginning of thetwo-year
 period  or  (b)  were  previously  elected  or  nominated  by  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  directors  in  office  at  the  time  of  theindividual director’s election or nomination;
•
A consolidation or merger of PG&E Corporation is consummated and results in the former PG&E Corporation shareholders owningless than 70% of the voting power in the surviving entity (or parent of the surviving entity);
•
Any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assetsof PG&E Corporation is consummated; or
•
The shareholders of PG&E Corporation approve a plan of liquidation or dissolution of PG&E Corporation.What
 happens  to  my  award  if  I  am  terminated  from  my  position  with  a  subsidiary  of  PG&E  Corporation  as  a  result  of  thedivestiture or change in control of the subsidiary?
Your
 award  agreement  describes  what  happens  to  your  award  upon  termination  of  your  position  by  a  subsidiary  of  PG&ECorporation as a result of a divestiture or “change in control” of the subsidiary.
Transferability: Resale Restrictions
May I transfer my stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards to someone else?
Unless
 otherwise  specified  in  your  award  agreement  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  LTIP,  you  may  not  transfer  your  stockoptions, SARS,
 restricted stock, performance awards, or restricted stock units during your lifetime other than pursuant to a qualified domesticrelations
 order  (QDRO)  or  similar  court  order. After  your  death,  your  awards  may  be  transferred  in  accordance  with your  will  or  inaccordance with the
 laws of descent and distribution. Except for options that may have been transferred as described above, your options maybe exercised during your lifetime only by you, your duly appointed legal representative, or the person named in a QDRO.
Are
 there any restrictions on my ability to sell common stock received when my awards are settled in shares of common stock orwhen I exercise my stock options?
You
 are  free  to  sell  your  stock  at  any  time,  except  when  you  are  subject  to  a  trading  blackout  or  while  you  are  in  possession  ofnonpublic material
 information about PG&E Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Confidential, nonpublic information should be consideredmaterial if there is substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information important. You are prohibited by securities
laws
 and  by  PG&E  Corporation’s  and  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company’s  Insider  Trading  Policy  from  trading  in  securities  of  PG&ECorporation
 or Pacific Gas and Electric Company until the information has been disclosed and widely disseminated to the investing public,typically
 two  full  trading  days  following  such  disclosure.  Also,  if  as  determined  by  PG&E  Corporation,  your  position  exposes  you  tononpublic
 material information, you may be temporarily prohibited from trading shares. You will be notified if this “blackout” period appliesto you.
What if I am an executive officer of PG&E Corporation?
If
 you are an executive officer of PG&E Corporation or Pacific Gas and Electric Company, you will be prohibited from engaging intransactions
 involving securities of PG&E Corporation or Pacific Gas and Electric Company during quarterly blackout periods and you willbe
 subject  to  the  other  conditions  of  PG&E  Corporation’s  and  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company’s  Insider  Trading  Policy  (in  particular,requiring
 10b5-1 plans for your transactions in PG&E shares subject to this prospectus). Executive officers of PG&E Corporation will beconsidered
 “affiliates” of PG&E Corporation (along with their spouses and other relatives sharing the same household). In general, if you arean affiliate of PG&E Corporation,
 your sales of shares must comply with SEC Rule 144. In addition, executive officers of PG&E Corporationand

 will not be able to buy or sell your shares if you are subject to the trading restrictions imposed by the Sarbanes OxleyAct of 2002 in connection with a blackout period under a PG&E Corporation sponsored retirement plan.
Tax Consequences
 
   The following is a general description of the United States federal income tax consequences relating to your awards under the Code ascurrently
 in effect and is not intended to be a complete description of all the possible tax consequences. Federal tax treatment may changeshould
 the Code be amended. The consequences may differ based on your personal situation. PG&E Corporation cannot assure you of anyparticular tax result and is not providing you with tax advice. If you have any questions regarding the tax consequences of receiving a grant of
stock options, SARS, restricted
 stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards you should contact your tax advisor. PG&E Corporationmakes
 no representation that the LTIP will comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to prevent Section 409A from applying tothe LTIP or any award or to mitigate its effects on any award.
You
 will be required to pay to PG&E Corporation, or to make arrangements satisfactory to PG&E Corporation for the payment ofwithholding taxes, including social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), and the California
State
 Disability Insurance (SDI) tax that become due in connection with your awards. PG&E Corporation’s obligations under the LTIP andyour
 award agreement are subject to payment of, or to the arrangement for payment of, all withholding taxes. PG&E Corporation will havethe right, to the extent permitted by law, to deduct any such withholding taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to you.
Are there any tax consequences when I am granted a nonqualified stock option or SARs?
In general, there are no immediate federal income tax consequences when you are granted nonqualified stock options or SARs.
What are the tax consequences when I exercise my stock options or SARs?
When
 you  exercise  a  nonqualified  stock  option  or  SAR,  you  generally  will  have  taxable  ordinary  income  equal  to  the  differencebetween the current fair market
 value of the shares of common stock and the exercise price or base price. The amount of ordinary income willbe included in your W-2 form for the year in which you exercised your stock option or SAR.
Will my exercise of a stock option or SAR be subject to tax withholding?
Yes.
 In  connection  with  the  exercise  of  a  nonqualified  stock  option  or  SAR,  PG&E  Corporation  will  be  required  to  withholdapplicable
 taxes on income you recognize upon the exercise. Please see your award agreement for the methods by which you may satisfy theapplicable withholding taxes.
What are the tax consequences if I sell the shares purchased upon exercise of a stock option?
If you sell
 the shares you purchased upon exercise of your nonqualified stock options you will be taxed on the excess of the sale priceover
 the market value of the shares on the exercise date (your tax basis). (The market value of the shares on the date of exercise will be thesum
 of the option exercise price plus the amount of ordinary income you recognized when the option was exercised.) Whether or not thisamount
 can be treated as long-term capital gain (or loss) depends on the length of time you held the shares before selling them. Currently, toreceive
 long-term capital gain treatment you must hold the stock for more than one year. If you are subject to alternative minimum tax, youshould consult your tax advisor.
If
 you paid the option exercise price by delivering shares you already owned, then the tax consequences upon sale of the shares areslightly
 different. Your tax basis in the surrendered shares and the length of time (the holding period) that you held the surrendered shareswill be carried over to an equal number of shares that you acquired upon exercise. If you purchased more shares than the number
xi

of shares you delivered, the holding period for the excess shares will start on the date of exercise and the price of such shares will be equal tothe market value of the shares on the date of exercise.
Are there any tax consequences when I am granted an incentive stock option?
In general, there are no immediate federal income tax consequences when you are granted incentive stock options.
What are the tax consequences when I exercise my incentive stock options?
You
 will  not  recognize  any  taxable  income,  for  regular  income  tax  purposes,  at  the  time  an  incentive  stock  option  is  exercised.However,
 the amount by which the fair market value (at the time of exercise) of the purchased shares exceeds the exercise price paid forthose shares will constitute an adjustment to your income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax.
What are the tax consequences if I sell the shares purchased upon exercise of an incentive stock option?
    The federal income tax liability will depend upon whether you make a qualifying or disqualifying disposition of the shares purchased under
the
 incentive stock option. Subject to certain requirements in the Code, a qualifying disposition will occur if the sale or other disposition ofshares
 takes place more than two years after the date the incentive stock option was granted and more than one year after the date that thestock
 option was exercised for the particular shares involved in the disposition. A disqualifying disposition is any sale or other dispositionmade before both of these requirements are satisfied.
What if I make a qualifying disposition?
 
   You will recognize a long-term capital gain equal to the excess of (a) the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition over (b) theexercise
 price paid for the shares. You will recognize a long-term capital loss if the amount realized is lower than the exercise price paid forthe shares.
What if I make a disqualifying disposition?
 
   If you dispose of shares before the minimum holding periods described above have been satisfied, you will recognize ordinary income atthe
 time of the disposition in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date over the exercise price paid for thoseshares. Any additional gain recognized on the disqualifying disposition will be taxable at capital gains rates (long-term if the shares have been
held
 for more than one year following the exercise date of the option). If the sale proceeds from a disqualifying disposition are less than thefair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, any ordinary income recognized is limited to the gain (if any) realized on the sale.
What are the tax consequences relating to restricted stock (including any Performance Share awards)?
 
   You will not recognize income until the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions lapse (i.e., you vest) unless you voluntarily elect torecognize income
 on the date of grant by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code. If you do not make a Section 83(b) election, thenat
 the time that the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions lapse, you will recognize as ordinary income an amount equal to the excessof the fair market value of the shares on the date of lapse over the purchase price (if any) paid for such shares.
What is a Section 83(b) election?
 
   A  Section  83(b)  election  is  available  only  for  awards  of  restricted  stock  (including  performance  shares).  Section  83(b)  allows  you  torecognize
 ordinary  income  on  the  fair  market  value  of  the  restricted  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  instead  of  on  the  date  the  award  vests.Thereafter,
 any further gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale or disposition of the restricted stock is treated as capital gain or loss.Section 83(b) elections may be made with respect to restricted stock awards, to the extent permitted by the Committee.
How are dividends and dividend equivalents related to my restricted stock awards taxed?
Any dividends
 received with respect to a restricted stock award will be subject to the same vesting terms as the related restricted stock award.If
 you do not make a Section 83(b) election, you will not recognize ordinary income with respect to the dividends until the related restrictedstock award vests (and therefore the dividends vest).
xii

What are the tax consequences relating to restricted stock units (including Performance Units)?You
 will not recognize income until the restricted stock units are settled. Generally, when your restricted stock units are settled aftervesting, you
 will have taxable ordinary income in the amount of the fair market value of the shares received in connection with the settlementof the restricted stock units and you will be required to satisfy applicable withholding taxes.
In
 the following situations you may be required to satisfy FICA and California SDI taxes even though the restricted stock units havenot yet been settled:
•
If you are retirement-eligible on the date of the award (if your award agreement provides for continued vesting after retirement),•
When you become “retirement-eligible,” if your award agreement provides for continued vesting after retirement,•
If your service is terminated other than for cause (as described in your award agreement), or•
Any other situations under which your restricted stock units vest before they are settled.How can I satisfy the amount of California SDI and FICA taxes that may be due before my restricted stock units are settled?
Under
 these circumstances FICA and California SDI taxes must be paid either by check payable to PG&E Corporation or throughpayroll deductions. Unless you deliver a check to PG&E Corporation, the amount will be satisfied through payroll deductions.
How can I satisfy the withholding taxes that arise when my restricted stock units vest?
 
   You  must  arrange  to  pay  the  withholding  taxes  that  arise  when  your  restricted  stock  units  vest  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  PG&ECorporation.
 PG&E Corporation may withhold from the shares otherwise issuable to you in settlement of restricted stock units a number ofwhole
 shares having a fair market value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the applicable withholding taxes. The remainingnumber of whole shares will be issued to you.
What
 are the tax consequences if I sell shares I acquire upon vesting of restricted stock unit awards or settlement of my restrictedstock units?    
    
If you recognize gain when you sell shares your gain will be taxable at long-term or short-term capital gain rates. If you recognize a loss, itwill
 be a capital loss. The amount of your gain or loss will be the difference between the amount you receive on the sale of the shares and thevalue
 used to calculate the applicable withholding taxes when your award was settled. Whether your gain or loss is long-term or short-termwill
 depend on whether you have held your shares for more than one year. The holding period generally begins at the time your performanceawards or restricted stock units are settled or stock options are exercised, and shares are issued to you.
What is the impact of Section 409A of the Code on my awards?
 
   If an award is treated as “nonqualified deferred compensation” and the award does not comply with or is not exempt from Section 409A,Section
 409A may impose additional taxes, interest and penalties on you. All grants made under the LTIP are designed and intended to eitherbe
 exempt  from  or  comply  with  Section  409A  to  avoid  such  additional  taxes,  interest  and  penalties.  Neither  the  Committee  nor  PG&ECorporation is obligated to ensure that awards comply with Section 409A or to take any actions to ensure such compliance.

 stock option allows you to buy a certain number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock at a fixed price. The per sharepurchase
 price (or exercise price) generally will be equal to the closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock on the date on which theoption is granted, unless otherwise specified in your award agreement.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of a stock option?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that the grant of stock options would be made in recognition of your service to PG&E Corporation (or anyof
 its  subsidiaries)  and  would  not  require  any  cash  payment.  To  purchase  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock  underlying  a  stock  option,however, you must exercise the stock option and pay the exercise price as described below and set forth in your award agreement.
When may I exercise my stock options?
You
 may not exercise your stock options until your right to do so has vested in accordance with the vesting terms that are determinedwhen
 the stock options are granted and set forth in your award agreement governing your stock options. Vesting is generally contingent onyour
 continued  service  to  PG&E  Corporation  or  its  affiliates  through  the  applicable  vesting  date.  Stock  options  may  also  be  subject  toperformance-based
 vesting measures that affect the number of options that you ultimately may be permitted to exercise. Please consult youraward agreement for details regarding the vesting terms of your stock options.
How do I exercise my stock options?
You must deliver a completed electronic exercise election form to the record-keeper for the LTIP, which is currently Charles Schwab.
Instructions for completing and submitting the form are available from the recordkeeper.
What happens if my service with PG&E Corporation ends before my stock option is fully vested and exercisable?
The award
 agreement describes what happens to the stock option if your service terminates before the stock option is fully vested andexercisable.
 In general, upon termination of service with PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeit all unvested stockoptions.

Although
 the term of an option may vary, in general, the term of each stock option is 10 years, unless otherwise specified in youraward agreement. The options generally will expire earlier upon or within a specified period following your termination of service.
Do I have any shareholder rights?
You will
 not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares subject to the options unless an option is exercised and sharesare issued to you.
    
A-5    
How do I pay for shares and taxes upon exercise of my stock options?Unless
 your award agreement provides otherwise, you may pay the option exercise price and applicable tax withholdings using (1)cash, check
 or cash equivalent; (2) shares of PG&E Corporation common stock; (3) a "cashless exercise" procedure (whereby a broker sells anumber
 of shares purchased upon exercise, with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholdings and remits thesale proceeds
 to PG&E Corporation to pay for the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholdings); (4) by surrendering a number ofshares
 of PG&E Corporation common stock that otherwise would have been issued to you in connection with the stock option exercise, withan
 aggregate fair market value (as determined as of the business day before the date of exercise) equal to the aggregate exercise price andapplicable
 tax withholdings, (5) by another method that pay be approved by the Committee or (6) any combination of the foregoing. If sharesare
 used to pay all or part of the exercise price, the cash and any shares surrendered must have a fair market value (determined as of thebusiness day before the date of exercise) that is not less than the applicable exercise price.
How is an incentive stock option different than a nonqualified stock option?    
An
 incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option have different U.S. federal tax consequences, which are explained in moredetail in the “
Tax Consequences ” section  below. Each stock option will be designated by the Committee as either an incentive stock option ora
 nonqualified stock option and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing the grant. If an option granted as an incentive stock option failsto qualify as an incentive stock option under the Code, it will be treated as a nonqualified stock option.
Stock Appreciation Rights
What is a stock appreciation right?
 
   A  stock  appreciation right  (SAR) gives  you the  right  to receive  an amount  equal  to the  excess of  the fair  market  value of  a share  ofcommon
 stock of PG&E Corporation on the date of exercise over a fixed value (the “Base Price”) of the SAR. A SAR may be settled in[shares
 of common stock, cash, or any combination thereof] as specified by the Committee. The Base Price of a SAR granted under the LTIPwill not be less than the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject to the SAR on the date the SAR is granted.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of stock appreciation rights?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that SARs would be granted in recognition of your service to PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries)and would not require any cash payment.
When may I exercise my SARs?
You
 may not exercise your SARs until your right to do so has vested in accordance with the vesting terms that are determined whenthe
 SARs are granted and set forth in your award agreement governing your SARs. Vesting is generally contingent on your continued serviceto
 PG&E Corporation or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date. SARs may also be subject to performance-based vesting measuresthat
 affect the number of SARs that you ultimately may be permitted to exercise. Please consult your award agreement for details regardingthe vesting terms of your SARs.
How do I exercise my SARs?
 
   You must deliver a completed electronic exercise election form to the record-keeper for the LTIP, currently Charles Schwab. Instructionsfor completing and submitting the form are available from the recordkeeper
What happens if my service with PG&E Corporation terminates before my stock appreciation right vests?

When do my SARs expire?

A-6    
Do I have any shareholder rights?You
 will  not  have  any  rights  of  a  shareholder  with  respect  to  the  SARs  unless  shares  subject  to  the  SARs  are  issued  to  you  insettlement
 of the SARs. However, if the SARs are settled in cash, you will not become a shareholder, even if the amount of cash payable isdetermined by reference to the value of shares of common stock.
Restricted Stock

    A restricted stock award is a grant of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that is subject to vesting.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of restricted stock?
 
   Generally, no. It is anticipated that restricted stock awards would be granted in recognition of your service to the PG&E Corporation (orany
 of its subsidiaries) and would not require any cash payment. However, in setting the terms of the grant, the Committee has the discretionto require payment.
When will restricted stock awards vest?

 contingent upon the achievement of specified performance conditions and/or such other terms and conditions determinedby
 the Committee. Restricted stock awards that are subject to performance-based vesting terms are referred to as Performance Shares in theLTIP,
 and  also  may  be  called  performance  share  units.  The  vesting  terms  of  a  restricted  stock  award  will  be  set  forth  in  your  awardagreement.

 vested and transferable. In general upon termination of service with the PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeitall unvested restricted stock awards.

 applicable restricted period, including the right to receive payment of dividends and distributions with respect to the underlying shares ofPG&E Corporation common stock (which will be subject to the same vesting terms as the underlying shares of common stock).

What are restricted stock units?
A
 restricted stock unit is a right to receive shares of PG&E Corporation common stock when the restricted stock units are settledfollowing vesting. PG&E Corporation common stock is not issued at the time of grant of a restricted stock unit award.
Will I be required to pay for a grant of restricted stock units?
Generally,
 no.  It  is  anticipated  that  restricted  stock  unit  awards  would  be  granted  in  recognition  of  your  service  to  the  PG&ECorporation
 (or any of its subsidiaries) and would not require any cash payment. However, in setting the terms of the grant, the Committeehas the discretion to require payment.
When will restricted stock units vest?
In
 order for your restricted stock awards to vest, you must generally remain in the service of PG&E Corporation during the vestingperiod. Vesting may also be contingent upon the achievement of
    
A-7    
specified performance conditions and/or such other terms and conditions determined by the Committee. Restricted stock unit awards that aresubject
 to performance-based vesting terms are referred to as Performance Shares in the LTIP. The vesting terms of a restricted stock awardwill be set forth in your award agreement.
What happens to restricted stock unit awards if my service with PG&E Corporation terminates before the scheduled vesting date?
 
   Your award agreement describes what happens to the restricted stock unit if your service terminates before the scheduled vesting date. Ingeneral,
 upon termination of service with the PG&E Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries), you will forfeit all unvested restricted stockunits.
Will I receive dividends on restricted stock units?
The
 Committee  may  provide  in  an  award  agreement  that  you  will  be  entitled  to  receive  dividend  equivalents  with  respect  to  thepayment
 of cash dividends, which, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, will be credited to you in the form of additional wholerestricted
 stock  units  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  such  cash  dividends  on  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock.  The  number  of  additionalrestricted stock
 units (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be credited shall be determined by dividing the amount of cash dividends paidon
 such date with respect to the number of shares of common stock represented by the restricted stock units previously granted to you, by thefair
 market  value  of  a  share  of  common  stock  on  such  date.  Settlement  of  dividend  equivalents  will  be  made  in  the  same  manner  as  therestricted stock units, which may include cash, shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation or a combination thereof.
How soon will I receive the shares after the restricted stock units have vested?     
PG&E Corporation will generally
 issue shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in respect of your restricted stock units within 60days after
 the restricted stock units vest but no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which any applicable performance periodends
 or at such other times as set forth in your award agreement. However, the Committee may also settle restricted stock units in cash or acombination of cash and shares of common stock.
PG&E
 Corporation  will  delay  the  issuance  of  any  shares  of  common  stock  to  the  extent  it  is  necessary  to  comply  with  Section409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
 (relating to payments made to certain “key employees” of certain publicly-traded companies). In such event, any shares ofcommon
 stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six-month period following the date of your “separation from service”under
 Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the first businessday following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
Do I have the same rights as other shareholders?
You
 will not have voting rights with respect to the restricted stock units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidencedby appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
Performance Awards
What are performance awards?
Performance
 awards may  be in the form of  Performance Shares or Performance Units  (each as may be described  above) and areawards
 that  are  eligible  to  vest  based  on  the  achievement  of  performance  measures  at  the  end  of  a  pre-established  performance  period(“Performance
 Period”), as set forth in your award agreement. Participants may receive one or more grants of performance awards, and eachgrant may reference one or more performance measures.
What are the performance measures and how do they work?
    A description of the applicable performance measures and how they work can be found in your award agreement.
When will performance awards vest?
Except
 as otherwise set forth in your ward agreement, vesting will occur following the Committee’s certification of the extent towhich
 the performance goals applicable to each type of performance measure are achieved. Certification will occur after the completion ofthe relevant Performance Period.
    
A-8    
Termination of ServiceWhat happens
 to stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards if my service is terminated?In
 general,  and  unless  otherwise  specified  in  your  award  agreement,  upon  your  voluntary  termination  of  service  with  PG&ECorporation (other than retirement, if
 provided for in your award agreement), your termination of service with or without cause, or your deathor
 disability, you will forfeit (1) any awards that have not yet vested and (2) any associated accrued dividends. Vested options generally mustbe exercised within 30 days or the remaining term of the stock options, whichever is shorter.
What happens to my stock options, SARS, restricted stock, performance awards, and restricted stock units if I retire?
If applicable, your award agreement will provide for the treatment of awards in the case of retirement.
Change in Control
What
 happens to stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards if there is a “change incontrol” of PG&E Corporation?
In general, and
 unless otherwise specified in your award agreement, in the event of a “change in control” (as defined in the LTIP), thesurviving,
 continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (“Acquiror”), may,without
 your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  your  outstanding  award  or  the  Acquiror  may  provide  substantially  equivalent  awards  insubstitution for those awards.
In
 general, and unless otherwise specified in your award agreement, if the Acquiror does  not assume  or continue your outstandingaward
 or if the Acquiror does not provide substantially equivalent awards, then your awards will become fully vested, and your options andSARs become exercisable immediately prior to the “change in control.”
What
 happens to my award if my service is terminated other than for cause in connection with a “change in control” of PG&ECorporation?
Your
 award agreement describes what happens to your award upon termination of your service by PG&E Corporation other than forcause in connection with a “change in control.”
What would be considered a “change in control” of PG&E Corporation?
The LTIP defines the term “change in control.” A change in control of PG&E Corporation occurs when:
•
Any person becomes the beneficial owner of securities of PG&E Corporation representing 30% or more of the combined voting power ofPG&E Corporation’s then outstanding securities;
•
If  during  any  two  consecutive  years  the  directors  at  the  beginning  of  the  two-year  period  cease  to  be  a  majority  of  the  Board  ofDirectors
 at the end of the period, unless the election, or the nomination for election by the shareholders, of each new director wasapproved
 by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who were either (a) directors at the beginning of thetwo-year
 period  or  (b)  were  previously  elected  or  nominated  by  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  directors  in  office  at  the  time  of  theindividual director’s election or nomination;
•
A consolidation or merger of PG&E Corporation is consummated and results in the former PG&E Corporation shareholders owningless than 70% of the voting power in the surviving entity (or parent of the surviving entity);
•
Any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assetsof PG&E Corporation is consummated; or
•
The shareholders of PG&E Corporation approve a plan of liquidation or dissolution of PG&E Corporation.    
A-9    
What  happens  to  my  award  if  I  am  terminated  from  my  position  with  a  subsidiary  of  PG&E  Corporation  as  a  result  of  thedivestiture or change in control of the subsidiary?
Your
 award  agreement  describes  what  happens  to  your  award  upon  termination  of  your  position  by  a  subsidiary  of  PG&ECorporation as a result of a divestiture or “change in control” of the subsidiary.
Transferability: Resale Restrictions
May I transfer my stock options, SARS, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards to someone else?
Unless
 otherwise  specified  in  your  award  agreement  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  LTIP,  you  may  not  transfer  your  stockoptions, SARS,
 restricted stock, performance awards, or restricted stock units during your lifetime other than pursuant to a qualified domesticrelations
 order  (QDRO)  or  similar  court  order. After  your  death,  your  awards  may  be  transferred  in  accordance  with your  will  or  inaccordance with the
 laws of descent and distribution. Except for options that may have been transferred as described above, your options maybe exercised during your lifetime only by you, your duly appointed legal representative, or the person named in a QDRO.
Are
 there any restrictions on my ability to sell common stock received when my awards are settled in shares of common stock orwhen I exercise my stock options?
You
 are  free  to  sell  your  stock  at  any  time,  except  when  you  are  subject  to  a  trading  blackout  or  while  you  are  in  possession  ofnonpublic material
 information about PG&E Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Confidential, nonpublic information should be consideredmaterial if there is substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information important. You are prohibited by securities
laws
 and  by  PG&E  Corporation’s  and  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company’s  Insider  Trading  Policy  from  trading  in  securities  of  PG&ECorporation
 or Pacific Gas and Electric Company until the information has been disclosed and widely disseminated to the investing public,typically
 two  full  trading  days  following  such  disclosure.  Also,  if  as  determined  by  PG&E  Corporation,  your  position  exposes  you  tononpublic
 material information, you may be temporarily prohibited from trading shares. You will be notified if this “blackout” period appliesto you.
What if I am an executive officer of PG&E Corporation?
If
 you are an executive officer of PG&E Corporation or Pacific Gas and Electric Company, you will be prohibited from engaging intransactions
 involving securities of PG&E Corporation or Pacific Gas and Electric Company during quarterly blackout periods and you willbe
 subject  to  the  other  conditions  of  PG&E  Corporation’s  and  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company’s  Insider  Trading  Policy  (in  particular,requiring

A-10    
Tax Consequences 
   The following is a general description of the United States federal income tax consequences relating to your awards under the Code ascurrently
 in effect and is not intended to be a complete description of all the possible tax consequences. Federal tax treatment may changeshould
 the Code be amended. The consequences may differ based on your personal situation. PG&E Corporation cannot assure you of anyparticular tax result and is not providing you with tax advice. If you have any questions regarding the tax consequences of receiving a grant of
stock options, SARS, restricted
 stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards you should contact your tax advisor. PG&E Corporationmakes
 no representation that the LTIP will comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to prevent Section 409A from applying tothe LTIP or any award or to mitigate its effects on any award.
You
 will be required to pay to PG&E Corporation, or to make arrangements satisfactory to PG&E Corporation for the payment ofwithholding taxes, including social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), and the California
State
 Disability Insurance (SDI) tax that become due in connection with your awards. PG&E Corporation’s obligations under the LTIP andyour
 award agreement are subject to payment of, or to the arrangement for payment of, all withholding taxes. PG&E Corporation will havethe right, to the extent permitted by law, to deduct any such withholding taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to you.
Are there any tax consequences when I am granted a nonqualified stock option or SARs?
In general, there are no immediate federal income tax consequences when you are granted nonqualified stock options or SARs.
What are the tax consequences when I exercise my stock options or SARs?
When
 you  exercise  a  nonqualified  stock  option  or  SAR,  you  generally  will  have  taxable  ordinary  income  equal  to  the  differencebetween the current fair market
 value of the shares of common stock and the exercise price or base price. The amount of ordinary income willbe included in your W-2 form for the year in which you exercised your stock option or SAR.
Will my exercise of a stock option or SAR be subject to tax withholding?
Yes.
 In  connection  with  the  exercise  of  a  nonqualified  stock  option  or  SAR,  PG&E  Corporation  will  be  required  to  withholdapplicable
 taxes on income you recognize upon the exercise. Please see your award agreement for the methods by which you may satisfy theapplicable withholding taxes.
What are the tax consequences if I sell the shares purchased upon exercise of a stock option?
If you sell
 the shares you purchased upon exercise of your nonqualified stock options you will be taxed on the excess of the sale priceover
 the market value of the shares on the exercise date (your tax basis). (The market value of the shares on the date of exercise will be thesum
 of the option exercise price plus the amount of ordinary income you recognized when the option was exercised.) Whether or not thisamount
 can be treated as long-term capital gain (or loss) depends on the length of time you held the shares before selling them. Currently, toreceive
 long-term capital gain treatment you must hold the stock for more than one year. If you are subject to alternative minimum tax, youshould consult your tax advisor.
If
 you paid the option exercise price by delivering shares you already owned, then the tax consequences upon sale of the shares areslightly
 different. Your tax basis in the surrendered shares and the length of time (the holding period) that you held the surrendered shareswill
 be carried over to an equal number of shares that you acquired upon exercise. If you purchased more shares than the number of sharesyou
 delivered, the holding period for the excess shares will start on the date of exercise and the price of such shares will be equal to themarket value of the shares on the date of exercise.
Are there any tax consequences when I am granted an incentive stock option?
In general, there are no immediate federal income tax consequences when you are granted incentive stock options.
What are the tax consequences when I exercise my incentive stock options?
You
 will  not  recognize  any  taxable  income,  for  regular  income  tax  purposes,  at  the  time  an  incentive  stock  option  is  exercised.However,
 the amount by which the fair market value (at the time of exercise) of the purchased shares exceeds the exercise price paid forthose shares will constitute an adjustment to your income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax.
    
A-11    
What are the tax consequences if I sell the shares purchased upon exercise of an incentive stock option?    The federal income tax liability will depend upon whether you make a qualifying or disqualifying disposition of the shares purchased under
the
 incentive stock option. Subject to certain requirements in the Code, a qualifying disposition will occur if the sale or other disposition ofshares
 takes place more than two years after the date the incentive stock option was granted and more than one year after the date that thestock
 option was exercised for the particular shares involved in the disposition. A disqualifying disposition is any sale or other dispositionmade before both of these requirements are satisfied.
What if I make a qualifying disposition?
 
   You will recognize a long-term capital gain equal to the excess of (a) the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition over (b) theexercise
 price paid for the shares. You will recognize a long-term capital loss if the amount realized is lower than the exercise price paid forthe shares.
What if I make a disqualifying disposition?
 
   If you dispose of shares before the minimum holding periods described above have been satisfied, you will recognize ordinary income atthe
 time of the disposition in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date over the exercise price paid for thoseshares. Any additional gain recognized on the disqualifying disposition will be taxable at capital gains rates (long-term if the shares have been
held
 for more than one year following the exercise date of the option). If the sale proceeds from a disqualifying disposition are less than thefair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, any ordinary income recognized is limited to the gain (if any) realized on the sale.
What are the tax consequences relating to restricted stock (including any Performance Share awards)?
 
   You will not recognize income until the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions lapse (i.e., you vest) unless you voluntarily elect torecognize income
 on the date of grant by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code. If you do not make a Section 83(b) election, thenat
 the time that the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions lapse, you will recognize as ordinary income an amount equal to the excessof the fair market value of the shares on the date of lapse over the purchase price (if any) paid for such shares.
What is a Section 83(b) election?
 
   A  Section  83(b)  election  is  available  only  for  awards  of  restricted  stock  (including  performance  shares).  Section  83(b)  allows  you  torecognize
 ordinary  income  on  the  fair  market  value  of  the  restricted  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  instead  of  on  the  date  the  award  vests.Thereafter,
 any further gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale or disposition of the restricted stock is treated as capital gain or loss.Section 83(b) elections may be made with respect to restricted stock awards, to the extent permitted by the Committee.
How are dividends and dividend equivalents related to my restricted stock awards taxed?
Any dividends
 received with respect to a restricted stock award will be subject to the same vesting terms as the related restricted stock award.If
 you do not make a Section 83(b) election, you will not recognize ordinary income with respect to the dividends until the related restrictedstock award vests (and therefore the dividends vest).
What are the tax consequences relating to restricted stock units (including Performance Units)?
You
 will not recognize income until the restricted stock units are settled. Generally, when your restricted stock units are settled aftervesting, you
 will have taxable ordinary income in the amount of the fair market value of the shares received in connection with the settlementof the restricted stock units and you will be required to satisfy applicable withholding taxes.
In
 the following situations you may be required to satisfy FICA and California SDI taxes even though the restricted stock units havenot yet been settled:
•
If you are retirement-eligible on the date of the award (if your award agreement provides for continued vesting after retirement),    
A-12    
•When you become “retirement-eligible,” if your award agreement provides for continued vesting after retirement,•
If your service is terminated other than for cause (as described in your award agreement), or•
Any other situations under which your restricted stock units vest before they are settled.How can I satisfy the amount of California SDI and FICA taxes that may be due before my restricted stock units are settled?
Under
 these circumstances FICA and California SDI taxes must be paid either by check payable to PG&E Corporation or throughpayroll deductions. Unless you deliver a check to PG&E Corporation, the amount will be satisfied through payroll deductions.
How can I satisfy the withholding taxes that arise when my restricted stock units vest?
 
   You  must  arrange  to  pay  the  withholding  taxes  that  arise  when  your  restricted  stock  units  vest  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  PG&ECorporation.
 PG&E Corporation may withhold from the shares otherwise issuable to you in settlement of restricted stock units a number ofwhole
 shares having a fair market value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the applicable withholding taxes. The remainingnumber of whole shares will be issued to you.
What
 are the tax consequences if I sell shares I acquire upon vesting of restricted stock unit awards or settlement of my restrictedstock units?    
    
If you recognize gain when you sell shares your gain will be taxable at long-term or short-term capital gain rates. If you recognize a loss, itwill
 be a capital loss. The amount of your gain or loss will be the difference between the amount you receive on the sale of the shares and thevalue
 used to calculate the applicable withholding taxes when your award was settled. Whether your gain or loss is long-term or short-termwill
 depend on whether you have held your shares for more than one year. The holding period generally begins at the time your performanceawards or restricted stock units are settled or stock options are exercised, and shares are issued to you.
What is the impact of Section 409A of the Code on my awards?
 
   If an award is treated as “nonqualified deferred compensation” and the award does not comply with or is not exempt from Section 409A,Section
 409A may impose additional taxes, interest and penalties on you. All grants made under the LTIP are designed and intended to eitherbe
 exempt  from  or  comply  with  Section  409A  to  avoid  such  additional  taxes,  interest  and  penalties.  Neither  the  Committee  nor  PG&ECorporation is obligated to ensure that awards comply with Section 409A or to take any actions to ensure such compliance.

EXHIBIT 10.99PG&E CORPORATION 
2012 OFFICER SEVERANCE POLICY 
(Amended effective as of November 1, 2021)
1.
Purpose . This is the controlling and definitive statement of the Officer Severance Policy of PG&E Corporation (“ Policy ”). Since Officers (defined below) are employed at the will of PG&E Corporation (“
Corporation ”) or a participating employer (“
Employer”), their employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause. A list of Employers is attached hereto as Appendix A. The Policy became effective March 1, 2012, and provides employees with the positions of Vice President, Senior Vice
President, Executive Vice President or higher at the time of termination (“
Officers ”) of the Corporation and Employers with severance benefits if their employment is terminated.
 The Policy’s definition of Change in Control was amended effective May 12, 2014.
 The Policy’s treatment of STIP payouts and limitations on certain severance payments were added effective September 25, 2020. The value of and eligibility for severance benefits was amended effective November 1, 2021. For the avoidance of doubt,
revisions made to this Policy relating to Code Section 409A (defined below), apply to all Officers including those that may be
covered under prior provisions of the Policy as required by Section 6 hereof.
The purpose of the Policy is to attract and retain Officers by defining terms and conditions for severance benefits, to provide
severance benefits that are part of a competitive total compensation package, to provide consistent treatment for all terminated
officers, and to minimize potential litigation costs associated with Officer termination of employment.
2.
Termination of Employment Not in Connection with Change in Control . (a)
Corporation or Employer’s Obligations . If the Corporation or an Employer exercises its right to terminate an Officer’s employment without cause and such termination does not entitle Officer to payments under Section 3, the Officer shall be given
thirty (30) days’ advance written notice or pay in lieu thereof (which shall be paid in a lump sum together with the payment
described in Section 2(a)(1) below). Except as provided in Section 2(c) below, in consideration of the Officer’s agreement to the
obligations described in Section 4 below and to the arbitration provisions described in Section 13 below, the following payments and
benefits shall also be provided to Officer following Officer’s separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A):
(1)
A lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of the Officer’s annual base compensation and the Officer’s Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) target award at the time of his or her termination) (the “Severance Base Amount”); provided,
however, that for purposes of this section 2(a)(1), any lump sum severance payment for the Corporation’s Chief
Severance benefits for Of
ficers who are currently covered by an employment agreement will continue to be provided solely under such agreements until theirexpiration at which tim
e this Policy will become effective for such Officers. Specific elements of any officer’s severance benefits may be amended byappropriate Board-leve
l approval. Any Officer’s waiver of benefits under this Policy shall take precedence over the terms of this Policy. If an employeebecomes a covered Offic
er under this Policy as a result of a promotion, and if such Officer was then covered by a severance arrangement subject to Section409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (
“Code Section 409A”), the severance benefits under this Policy provided to such person shall comply with thetime and form of paymen
t provisions of such prior severance arrangement, to the extent required by Code Section 409A.    .
    
Any payments made hereunder shall be less applicable taxes.    A-14    1

Executive Officer shall be equal to the product of (1) two and (2) such officer’s Severance Base Amount. Annual base compensationshall mean the Officer’s monthly base pay for the month in which the Officer is given notice of termination, multiplied by 12. The
payment described in this Section 2(a)(1) shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the date the release of
claims described in Section 2(e)(1) becomes effective, provided that payment shall in no event be made later than the 15th day of the
third month following the later of the end of the calendar year or the Corporation’s taxable year in which the Officer’s separation
from service occurs;
(2)
Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable award agreement or as otherwise required by applicable law, the equity-based incentive awards granted to Officer under the Corporation’s Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”) which have
not yet vested as of the date of termination will continue to vest over a period of twelve months after the date of termination as if the
Officer had remained employed for such period. Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable award agreement, for vested stock
options as of the date of termination, the Officer shall have the right to exercise such stock options at any time within their respective
terms or within five years after termination, whichever is shorter. Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable award agreement,
for stock options that vest during a period of twelve months, the Officer shall have the right to exercise such options at any time
within one year after termination, subject to the term of the options. Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable award agreement,
any unvested equity-based incentive awards remaining at the end of such period shall be forfeited;
(3) A prorated annual incentive payment equal to the annual incentive payment, if any, that the Officer would have
earned for the entire calendar year in which the termination occurs pursuant to the Officer’s then-current STIP; based on Eligible
Earnings paid between January 1 of such calendar year and the Officer’s date of termination (a “Pro-Rata Incentive”). Subject to
Section 14, an Officer’s Pro-Rata Incentive shall be paid by the Officer’s former employer on the date that annual incentive
payments are paid to the Employers’ active employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the People and Compensation Committee (or
its successor) of the Corporation may, decrease, or eliminate the Pro-Rata Incentive for the Officer in its sole discretion. For
purposes of this section, “Eligible Earnings” means the sum of the Officer’s: base pay, including paid time off; lump-sum payments
as part of a merit increase; temporary assignment pay, including lump-sum payments; and for an Officer on Paid Family Leave or
Short-Term Disability, payments made for approved leaves;

benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Officer is eligible to receive under any plan, contract or agreement of the
Corporation or Employer;
(6)    A lump sum cash payment of $19,500, equal to the estimated reasonable value of career transition services for
the Officer following separation from service.
(7)    All acts required of the Employer under the Policy may be performed by the Corporation for itself and the
Employer, and the costs of the Policy may be equitably apportioned by the Administrator among the Corporation and the other
Employers. The Corporation shall be responsible for making payments and providing benefits pursuant to this Policy for Officers
employed by the Corporation. Whenever the Employer is permitted or required under the terms of the Policy to do or perform any

3

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) in the event such executive officer engaged in misconduct that materially contributed to someof the actions or omissions on which the Company Conviction is based (as determined by the applicable Board in its discretion). The
Corporation, the Utility, their affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, and employees shall have no liability to any such
executive officer, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Corporation or the Utility, in the event of
restriction, limitation, reduction, recoupment, forfeiture, reimbursement, or cancellation of the provisions of Section 2(a), other than

or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive Officer has not substantially performed the Executive Officer’s duties; or (ii)
the willful engaging by the Executive Officer in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially demonstrably injurious to
the Corporation.
For purposes of the provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive Officer, shall be considered
“willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive Officer in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
Executive Officer’s action or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority
given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a
senior officer of the Corporation or based upon the advice of counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done,
or omitted to be done, by the Executive Officer in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation. The cessation of
employment of the Executive Officer shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the
Executive Officer a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership
of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board of Directors called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided
to the Executive Officer and the Executive Officer is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board of

Executive Officer (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then Executive Officer’s
payments and benefits under this Policy or otherwise payable to Executive Officer outside of this Policy shall be either delivered in
full (without the Corporation paying any portion of such excise tax), or delivered as to 2.99 times of Executive's base amount (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) so as to result in no portion of such payments and benefits being subject to such excise
tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and such excise tax,
results in the receipt by Executive Officer on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of payments and benefits, notwithstanding that
all or some portion of such payments and benefits may subject to such excise tax. Unless the Corporation and Executive Officer
otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 3(d)(1) shall be made in writing by Deloitte & Touche (the
“Accounting Firm”), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Executive Officer and the Corporation for all
purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 3(d)(1), the Accounting Firm may make reasonable
assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the
application of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Corporation and Executive Officer shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such
information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 3(d)
(1).
Any reduction in payments and/or benefits shall occur in the following order as reasonably determined by the Accounting Firm: (1)
reduction of cash payments, (2) reduction of non-cash/non-equity-based payments or benefits, and (3) reduction of vesting
acceleration of equity-based awards; provided, however, that any non-taxable payments or benefits shall be reduced last in
accordance with the same categorical ordering rule.  In the event items described in (1) or (2) are to be reduced, reduction shall occur
in reverse chronological order such that the payment or benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event
triggering the excise tax will be the first payment to be reduced (with reductions made pro-rata in the event payments are owed at the
same time).  In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity-based awards is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be
cancelled in a manner such as to obtain the best economic benefit for the officer (with reductions made pro-rata if economically
equivalent), as determined by the Accounting Firm.
4.

business competitive with any business of the Corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates.

event of such termination, the Corporation shall have no further obligations under this Policy and shall be entitled to recover
damages. In the event of an Officer’s breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 4, the Corporation

Employer may have and shall not be subject to a requirement that Officer mitigate or attempt to mitigate damages resulting from
Officer’s termination of employment.
7.    
Amendment and Termination. The Corporation, acting through its People and Compensation Committee (or its successor), reserves the right to amend or terminate the Policy at any time; provided, however, that any amendment which would reduce the

notice period shall be the first anniversary of the Corporation giving notice to Officers of such amendment or termination.

aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform its obligations by operation or law or otherwise.
This Policy shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Officer (and Officer’s personal representatives and heirs),

son, firm, corporation orother business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires the stock of the
Corporation or to which the Corporation assigns this Policy by operation of law or otherwise. If Officer should die while any amount
would still be payable to Officer hereunder if Officer had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall
be paid in accordance with this Policy to Officer’s devisee, legatee or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to Officer’s
estate.

the Corporation), or as a right of the Officer to continued employment, or to remain as an Officer, or as a limitation on the right of
the Corporation (or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Corporation) to discharge Officer at any time, with or without cause.
11.    
Benefits Unfunded and Unsecured.  The payments under this Policy are unfunded, and the interest under this Policy of any Officer and such Officer’s right to receive payments under this Policy shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the
Corporation.

subsidiary), the termination thereof or any claims for benefits shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Provided, however, that

on any dispute or controversy covered by this Section 13. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators’ award in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
