PART I
Item 1. - Business
The Company
    Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. Our history dates back
more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the USA. Today, we are a global leader in developing and producing responsible
packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Our innovation excellence and global
packaging expertise enables us to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional,
appealing, and cost effective for our customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.
Sustainability
    Sustainability is central to our business and one of our most exciting opportunities for growth. Working daily to embed sustainability deeper
into everything we do, Amcor has been a leader in the industry in promoting sustainability. We aspire to improve the quality of lives, protect
ecosystems, and preserve natural resources for future generations by offering a unique range of responsible packaging solutions, leveraging our
global scale, reach, and expertise to meet our customers’ growing sustainability expectations. In January 2018, we became the world’s first
packaging company to pledge that all our packaging would be designed to be recycled, compostable, or reusable by 2025 and also committed to
increasing the amount of recycled content we use. We are delivering against these commitments and continue to lead in the development of a
responsible packaging value chain through our innovations and partnerships. We have identified a clear path to meeting our sustainability
ambitions and those of our customers by focusing on the three elements of responsible packaging – product innovation, consumer participation,
and infrastructure development.
Differentiated Solutions
    Our product portfolio is diverse and dynamic due to our constant innovation and close partnerships with our customers. Behind every one of
our products stands a unique combination of technical know-how, business experience, and expertise. We work closely with our customers to
identify feasible, high-performance, responsible packaging solutions based on their unique needs. Where solutions do not currently exist, we
work to innovate new ones. We invest approximately $100 million every year in our industry-leading research and development capabilities,
bringing together the best in packaging design, science, manufacturing, and people.
Expertise across Packaging Materials
    We believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer a variety of packaging solutions with a wide, differentiated portfolio of products. Our
packaging expertise covers all main packaging materials including paper, metal, plastic, recycled, and bio-based materials and the sustainable use
of recyclable plastics. Our expertise and track record translate across many innovative solutions that customers can explore with ease and
convenience to meet their growing packaging needs, while improving environmental impact.
Business Strategy
Strategy
    Our business strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global
packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders, and the environment.
Focused portfolio
    Our portfolio of businesses share certain important characteristics:
•A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•good industry structure,
•attractive relative growth, and
•multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position, scale, and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation.
5
    These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons,
and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
    "The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent,
Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline. Our values of Safety, Integrity, Collaboration,
Accountability, and Results and Outperformance guide our behavior, driving our winning aspiration to be THE leading global packaging
company.
Shareholder value creation
    Through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently
create superior value for shareholders. The nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets means that year-to-year volatility should be
relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time, value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination
of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders
via share buybacks.
6
Segment Information
    Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in
financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, we have determined we have two reportable segments, Flexibles and Rigid
Packaging. The reportable segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to
customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific
regions. Refer to Note 21, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments.
Flexibles Segment
    Our Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 37,000 employees at 169 significant
manufacturing and support facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2022, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic,
aluminum, and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2022, Flexibles accounted for approximately 77% of consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
    Our Rigid Packaging Segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2022, the Rigid
Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 52 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal
year 2022, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 23% of consolidated net sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
    Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located
throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of
customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and
customer service teams.
    We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years.
    The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include
service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc.,
Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I
Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company, and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held
companies.
    We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate; however, due to the diversity of our business, our
precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable.
Backlog
    Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels
that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to
fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the markets in which we operate.
Raw Materials
    Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased
from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While persistent
industry-wide shortages of certain raw materials have continued to occur since the second half of fiscal 2021, we have been able to manage
supply disruptions with no material impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages can lead and have in the past
led to increased raw material price volatility. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through
contractual price mechanisms over time and other means. We expect supply disruption and price volatility to continue into fiscal year 2023 and
will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize the impact on our operations.
7
Intellectual Property
    We are the owner or licensee of more than a thousand United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our
products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other
countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a
competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time
by operation of law, in accordance with their terms, or otherwise.
Sustainability and Innovation
    We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food, beverages, and healthcare products, protect
consumers, and promote brands. Consumers also want cost effective, convenient, and easy to use packaging with a reduced environmental
footprint and a responsible end of life solution. We have identified a clear path to provide food, beverages, and healthcare products to people
around the world in a more sustainable way, and meet our sustainability ambitions, and those of our customers by focusing on what we believe
are the three elements of responsible packaging: product innovation, consumer participation, and infrastructure development. We believe our
commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success. Our responsible packaging solutions address both how the product is made, as
well as what happens after the consumer uses it, offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers’
specific packaging needs. Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from the investments we are making in sustainable
packaging innovation and design, to the partnerships we enter, and to how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently.
    Innovation is central to Amcor’s approach to sustainability and we spend approximately $100 million a year on research and development. We
are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and have more than a thousand active patents. We solve packaging challenges, developing
differentiated products, services, and processes to protect our customers products and fulfil the needs of the consumers who rely on them around
the globe. Drawing on unrivaled heritage in design, science and manufacturing, our more than 1,000 research and development ("R&D")
professionals and engineers are constantly innovating new materials, formats, and technologies.
    We collaborate with like-minded partners, including customers and suppliers, in pursuit of innovative solutions to address some of the world’s
most urgent challenges, including increasing recycling and reuse and protecting our planet. We also partner with non-governmental organizations,
promising startups, and cross-industry initiatives and bodies. These partnerships enable us to learn, experience other perspectives, share our
expertise, and expand our innovation. With our partners, we advocate for sound global standards, better waste management infrastructure, and
more consumer participation.
    We consider our overall environmental footprint to go well beyond the products we create. We also strive to continuously reduce the
environmental impacts of our operations and, for more than a decade, our EnviroAction program has helped us significantly improve how we
manage energy, water, and waste in every one of our locations. In January 2022, we further increased our efforts by committing to science-based
targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. These new commitments have been recognized by the
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and build on years of progress under our EnviroAction program. Through our unique material science
and innovation capabilities, we also advise our customers on the best solutions for their specific needs and those of their consumers – with broad
flexibility across packaging functionality, formats, and materials.
    With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the
design and development of more sustainable packaging, and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor.
Governmental Laws and Regulations
    Our operations and the real property we own, or lease, are subject to broad governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws
and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to employee health and safety, the discharge of certain materials into
the environment, handling and disposition of waste, cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, other rules to control pollution and manage
natural resources, and other government regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable health and safety laws,
environmental laws and regulations based on the execution of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of
those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not, in the future, incur liability with respect to
noncompliance with health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or
8
operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, or
other broad government regulations which could be significant. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot
always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 20, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for
information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A.
"Risk Factors."
Seasonal Factors
    The business of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
    Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and
development expenditures and policies.

Human Capital Management
Overview
    Amcor’s aspiration is to be ‘THE leading global packaging company'. Our people are core to the achievement of our aspiration. We believe we
are winning for our people when they feel safe, engaged, and are developing as part of a high-performing, global team. We strive to build an
outperformance culture in which we consistently deliver results and strive to surpass expectations. At Amcor, we are stronger because of the
diverse strengths, styles, cultures, and experiences of our people. We aim to create inclusive working environments to ensure each colleague feels
valued, treated with respect, encouraged to speak, and empowered to be their best.
    As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 44,000 employees, including part-time and temporary workers, worldwide, with approximately
30% located in North America, 30% located in Europe, 20% located in Latin America, and 20% located in the Asia Pacific region. Collective
bargaining agreements cover approximately 46% of our workforce. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 6% of our employees were working
under expired contracts and approximately 21% were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year.
Health and Safety
    Safety is a core value at Amcor. We take care of ourselves and each other, so everyone returns home safely every day. Across every level of
our organization, we role model and recognize safe and responsible behavior as we strive to achieve an injury-free Amcor. All our facilities abide
by global Environment, Health, and Safety ("EHS") standards for safety and environmental management. Our Board of Directors receives
monthly reports on safety performance and compliance with our global EHS standards. During fiscal year 2022, we reduced the number of
injuries by 3% and 57% of our sites were injury free.
    Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates our commitment to the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which
we work. We implemented rigorous protocols supported by precautionary measures in each of our manufacturing and office locations globally to
help ensure the health and safety of our people.
    As we emerge from the pandemic and continue to focus on the health of our employees, we have worked diligently to provide a compelling
workplace for them to return to while recognizing and accommodating the need for flexibility.
Developing Talent
    At Amcor, we are dedicated to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best talent to deliver our 'Winning Aspiration' and ensure a
strong succession pipeline for the future.
    Our approach to talent is guided by the understanding that differentiated, industry-leading talent deployed consistently across our business will
enable Amcor’s success.
    We deploy systems and processes to ensure our people have clear goals and are empowered to achieve them. Through performance
management, we align these goals to business targets, providing line of sight so each employee understands how they contribute to our success.
Through formal reviews, performance coaching, and feedback, our leaders implement a rigorous cycle to foster talent.
Learning & Development
    We have implemented training and education programs to help our employees progress across functions and experience levels. Examples of
these programs include a Leading to Outperform program ("LTO") to further advance high-potential talent, a Senior Leader Development
program ("SLDP") focusing on developing strategic management skills and inclusive leadership, and an Executive Development program
("EDP") for our most senior leaders. In each of these programs we partner with leading academic and executive education institutions from
around the world.
    Recognizing the importance of the learning journey, our employees can also access our "Masterclass" program which delivers an annual series
of executive education briefings on topics of functional excellence and business initiatives. Our focus this year has been on Accelerating Growth
with showcase presentations from Marketing, R&D, Product Branding, and Innovation Leaders.
    Our "JumpStart@Amcor" global program accelerates onboarding of new employees and provides an avenue for cross-functional learning. We
also run an Accelerated Career Development program ("ACDP") which provides a global intake on new talent with a structured rotation to
develop commercial capabilities and an enhanced global commercial talent pipeline.
10
Diversity & Inclusion
    At Amcor, we’re committed to providing an inclusive environment that empowers us to achieve our full potential. Becoming THE leading
global packaging company requires us to create a culture in which everyone feels encouraged to speak and compelled to listen.
    Amcor is stronger as a result of the diverse talents, styles, cultures, and experiences of our people. With different perspectives come different
solutions that enable us to win for our stakeholders. We are one global team in which everyone has a voice and can make a difference. With this
in mind, we work to create a team environment that develops inclusive leaders, where we learn from our people, and where listening, trust, and
respect are key behaviors that form the foundation of our interactions and foster mutual understanding.
    We focus on strengthening 'talent through diversity' and progress is reported to our Board annually. We continually review opportunities to
strengthen our diversity transparency practices while adhering to privacy legislation in certain regions where we operate.
Engagement
    During fiscal year 2022, we completed our fifth global engagement survey. Titled "OurVoice@Amcor", the survey tracks the engagement of
our employees across multiple dimensions and provides a benchmark against other global manufacturing companies. In the recent 2022 survey,
we received feedback from over 30,000 Amcor employees from every country and business group. The dominant feedback was that colleagues
feel Amcor is a great place to work and that they want more communication with leadership about the direction and future strategies of the
Company. Action plans are underway across the organization to provide feedback loops and implement action plans.
Ethics
    Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our aspirations. Our employees are expected to act with integrity
and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance.
    We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy which is signed by every Amcor employee and provides the Company's
framework for making ethical business decisions. We provide targeted training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive
adherence to the national laws in each country in which we operate.

    The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other filings by us with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Other factors not
presently known to us or, that we presently believe are not material, could also affect our business operations and financial results.
Strategic Risks
Changes in Consumer Demand — We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous
industries.
    Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Alternative consumer
preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of
changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result in a decline in the demand for certain of
our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations
due to many factors, including our or our customers' inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in
industry standards, or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner.
    Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the
extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Key Customers and Customer Consolidation — The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation
among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability.
    Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply
choices available to customers. While we do not have a single customer accounting for more than ten percent of our net sales, customer
concentration can be more pronounced within certain businesses. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction
in their production requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net
profit. There is no assurance that existing customer relationships will be renewed at existing volume or price levels, or at all.
    Customers with operations subject to physical risks, including due to climate change, may relocate production to areas that are less impacted
and such areas may be out of range of Amcor's production sites or supplying such relocated facilities may lead to additional costs. Any loss,
change, or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, or cash flows, which effect may be material.
    In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This
consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from
customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the
acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing
pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Competition — We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.
    We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures, and competitive
behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which we operate and we continue to change in
response to consumer demand. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness.
    The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our
operating results. In addition, our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their
ability to compete for our current or potential customers. No assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will
not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
13
Expanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including
product innovation, or acquisitions.
    Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand
relationships with customers in emerging markets, product innovation, including to address changes in the industry or regulatory environments,
and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control.
Our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or
reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities, or otherwise. For many of our businesses,
organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development, and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences.
Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our
growth potential, affect our competitive position, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
    Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify
suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions
on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on
acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our
strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits.
    We also may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges could include difficulty in
integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures which may lead to anticipated
benefits of acquisitions not being realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so. In addition,
the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations.
Operational Risks
Global Economic Conditions — Challenging current and future global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain
disruptions, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.
    Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage,
healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic
regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict
have increased volatility in world economies. Current global economic challenges, including relatively high inflation and supply chain
constraints in key regions in which we operate, are likely to continue to put pressure on our business.
    When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or
fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers,
which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in a loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in
unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. Although we take measures to mitigate the impact of
inflation, including through pricing actions and productivity programs, if these actions are not effective our cash flow, financial condition, and
results of operations could materially and adversely be impacted. In addition, there could be a time lag between recognizing the benefit of our
mitigating actions and when the inflation occurs and there is no assurance that our mitigating measures will be able to fully mitigate the impact of
inflation.
    Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, in
fiscal year 2022, political developments and general civil unrest in South Africa and the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulted in net expenses of $213
million, including impairment and restructuring expenses. Future unrest in other regions in which we operate could result in a material impact to
our financial condition. Political developments can also disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may
cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees, and adversely impact profitability.
14
International Operations — Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and
financial results.
    We have operations throughout the world, including facilities located in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 73% of our sales
revenue came from developed markets and 27% came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future,
particularly in the emerging markets.
    Management of global operations is complex, particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural, political, and regulatory
environments of the countries in which we operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we have operations, including Argentina, Brazil,
China, Colombia, India, Peru, Russia, South Africa, and Ukraine, have underdeveloped or developing legal, regulatory, or political systems,
which are subject to dynamic change, including civil unrest.
The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things:
•changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;
•changes in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, local laws, sanctions, and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign
investment and foreign exchange control laws;
•nullification, modification, or renegotiation of, or difficulties or delays in enforcing, contracts with clients or joint venture partners that
are subject to local law;
•reversal of current political, judicial, or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade, or relating to the use of
local agents, representatives, or partners in the relevant jurisdictions;
•pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting various regions of the world unequally; or
•changes in exchange rates and inflation, including hyperinflation, which may be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Further, sustained periods of legal, regulatory, or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect
on our business, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations, which effect may be material.
    The recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted the global economy and led to various economic sanctions being
imposed by the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries against Russia. In advance of the conflict, we proactively suspended
operations at our manufacturing site in Ukraine. We also operate three manufacturing facilities in Russia which we have classified as held for sale
at June 30, 2022. We have recorded impairment charges related to our operations in Ukraine and Russia of $138 million in fiscal year 2022. It is
not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict. Further sanctions as well as steps taken by our customers,
suppliers, or other stakeholders may disrupt our ability to sell our assets in Russia. Continued escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the
conflict could result in the loss of property, supply chain disruptions, significant inflationary pressure on raw material prices and cost and supply
of other resources (such as energy and natural gas), fluctuations in our customers’ buying patterns given regional shortages of food ingredients
and other factors, credit and capital market disruption which could impact our ability to obtain financing, increase in interest rates, and adverse
foreign exchange impacts. These broader consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, and
results of operations.
    The international scope of our operations, which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain
economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the U.S. Department of State, and Trade and other applicable
national and supranational organizations (collectively, "Sanctions"), and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to
Sanctions, including those enacted as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, also requires us to maintain internal processes and control
procedures. Failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those relating to money
laundering, corruption, export control, fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition, and economic sanctions, whether due to a lack of
integrity or awareness or otherwise. Any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to
our business, which effect may be material.
Raw Materials — Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our
business.
    As a manufacturer of packaging products, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and
other inputs, including energy. All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and
films, inks and solvents, aluminum, and fiber-based carton board. Prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are
beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics, such as COVID-19, currency and commodity price
fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, geopolitical risks, including war (such as the
Russia-Ukraine conflict) and
15
instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. For example, we have seen disruptions in the supply of certain raw
materials, such as specialty resins, and increased price volatility of certain raw materials across many of the regions in which we operate since the
second half of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, changes in international trade policy in the countries in which we operate could materially impact
the cost and supply of raw materials as duties are assessed on raw materials used in our production process and global supply of key raw
materials is disrupted. For example, in 2018, the U.S. government imposed a 10% tariff on all aluminum imports into the United States from
China and in July 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced an investigation to determine whether imports of aluminum from Thailand
and South Korea circumvented the duties on Chinese aluminum.
    While we have largely been able to successfully manage through these supply disruptions and related price volatility, there is no assurance we
will be able to successfully navigate through any ongoing and future disruptions. Increases in costs and disruptions in supply can have an adverse
effect on our business and financial results. Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including by entering into
contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to
increase our prices to offset increases in raw material costs and seeking alternative sources of supply for key raw materials, there is no guarantee
that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements or mitigate supply disruptions. In addition, there may be
delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and corresponding impacts on our working capital and level of
indebtedness and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows, which effect may be material.    
Commercial Risks — We are subject to production, supply, and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be
exacerbated in times of economic volatility.
    We face a number of commercial risks, including (i) operational disruption, such as mechanical or technological failures or forced closures due
to pandemics or war (such as COVID-19 or the Russia-Ukraine conflict), each of which could, in turn, lead to production loss and/or increased
costs, (ii) shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and (iii) risks associated with
development projects (such as cost overruns and delays).
    Supply shortages, fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping capacity, or other disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result
of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to COVID-19 or other natural disasters, or war, could affect our
ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely impact our ability to supply products to
our customers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we
have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary
screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread
of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply
chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business activities.
    Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our customers, suppliers, and financial institutions, such as banks and
insurance providers, may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated in times of
economic volatility (such as economic volatility caused by COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict), either globally or in the geographies and
industries in which our customers operate. If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts
owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to
meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or, alternatively,
fulfill those obligations ourselves, which is likely to be more expensive. The occurrence of any of these risks, including any default by our
counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, which effect may be
material and result in a competitive disadvantage.
Global Health Outbreaks — Our business and operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19") or
other similar pandemics.
    Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19. As a result of
COVID-19, governmental authorities have implemented and, in certain regions, are continuing to implement numerous measures to try to contain
the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. Measures
providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have
experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services.
16
    COVID-19 has in the past, and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities, the facilities of our suppliers, or other
suppliers in our supply chain. In limited cases to date, certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak
within their facilities, which has impacted their demand, and we may continue to experience volatility in demand from temporary customer
shutdowns. In addition, COVID-19 has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries,
including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of capital markets, supply chains, foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. COVID-19 may result in a prolonged economic downturn, such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending,
business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to manage
these impacts, the extent to which COVID-19 or other pandemics impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at
attractive rates, is unknown and the effect could be material.
Attracting and Retaining Skilled Workforce — If we are unable to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled
workforce, we may be adversely affected.
    Our continued success depends on our ability to identify, attract, develop, and retain skilled personnel in our global executive management
team and our operations. We focus on our talent acquisition processes, as well as our onboarding and talent and leadership programs, to ensure
our key new hires and skilled personnel’s efficiency and effectiveness aligns with Amcor’s values and ways of working. However, any failure to
successfully transition key new hires and retain our skilled personnel in any of our operations and our global executive management team, could
impact our ability to execute on our strategic plans, make it difficult to meet our performance objectives and be disruptive to our business.
    We are also impacted by regional labor shortages, inflationary pressures on wages, and an increasingly competitive labor market. While we
have been successful to date in responding to regional labor shortages and maintaining plans for continuity of succession, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to manage through future labor shortages or recruit, develop, assimilate, motivate, and retain employees in the
future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture.
Operational EHS Risks — We are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environment, health and safety ("EHS") laws
and regulations, as well as changes in the global climate, that could adversely affect our business.
    We are required to comply with EHS laws, rules, and regulations in each of the countries in which we operate and do business. Additionally,
many of our products come into contact with the healthcare products and food and beverages they package and therefore, we are also subject to
certain local and international standards related to such products. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure
of financial and employee resources.
    In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might,
directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in
legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in
which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, increased regulation of
emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase
the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of
fossil fuel-based inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot
predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance.
    Federal, state, provincial, and local laws and requirements pertaining to workplace health and safety conditions are significant factors in our
business to assure our people at all locations are able to go home safely every day. Changes to these laws and requirements may result in
additional costs and actions across the affected country and/or region. Various government agencies may promulgate new or modified legislation,
and implement special emphasis programs and enforcement actions that could impact specific Company operations covered by the respective
program.     
    Federal, state, provincial, foreign, and local environmental requirements relating to air, soil, and water quality, handling, discharge, storage,
and disposal of a variety of substances, and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally
result in an increase to our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is,
or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own, used, or operate (including facilities that may be acquired by us in the
future). Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial,
and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditure.
    We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties, and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating
to the damage of natural resources, lost property values, and toxic tort claims. Provisions are raised
17
when it is considered probable that we have some liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. However, because the extent of potential
environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long
period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount. Accordingly,
additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position, which may be material.
    The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business. A number of governmental bodies have
introduced, or are contemplating introducing, regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change, which, where implemented, may have
adverse impacts on our operations or financial results.
Labor Disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which could adversely affect our business.
    Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor
disputes in the future, including protests and strikes, which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operation. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future.
Climate Change - Our business is subject to risks related to climate change which could negatively impact our business operations and
financial results.
    Climate change may have a progressively adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, suppliers, and partners. Many of the
geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes,
snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, forest fires, and drought. Such events may have a physical impact on our facilities, inventory, suppliers, and
equipment and any unplanned downtime at any of our facilities could result in unabsorbed costs that could negatively impact our results of
operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime. Longer-term climate change patterns could significantly alter customer demand
which is especially true for customers who rely on supply chains routinely impacted by weather. For example, agricultural supply chains would
be impacted by increased levels of drought or flooding and customers in coastal regions would be impacted by frequent flooding.
Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks
Information Technology — A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, compromise
customer, employee, supplier, and other data, and could negatively affect our business.
    We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and
various business functions, and on various technologies to process, store, and report information about our business, and to interact with
customers, suppliers, and employees around the world. In addition, our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require
different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization, and governance changes as well as
alignment of third-party suppliers on market standards. As with all information technology systems, our systems may be susceptible to damage,
disruption, information loss or shutdown due to a variety of factors including power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or
replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access, and
malicious or accidental destruction, or theft of information or functionality.
Cybersecurity Risk — The disruption of our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information could negatively impact our
financial condition and results of operations.
    Increased cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing, hacking, and other types of attacks
pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology systems, including those provided by third parties. We have experienced
and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems and networks. Geopolitical
turmoil, including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, heightens the risk of cyber-attacks. While we have operational safeguards in place to
detect and prevent cyber-attacks and to date have not experienced any significant impacts, our safeguards may not always be able to prevent a
cyber-attack from impacting our systems which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows. In addition, our customers and suppliers are susceptible to cyber-attacks and disruption to their information technology systems could
result in reduced demand for our products or limit our ability to supply our products.
    We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws,
regulations, and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information, our facilities and systems
18
and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misplaced or lost data, and
programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information. Information
system damages, disruptions, shutdowns, or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors,
loss of customers, and business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, negative
publicity resulting in reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments, and other costs, any of which could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage.
Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, and services remain
potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.
Financial Risks
Indebtedness and Credit Rating — A significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating
flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
    At June 30, 2022, we had $6.5 billion of debt outstanding and a $1.4 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and we are not restricted in
incurring, and may incur, additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our indebtedness is
dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows which is dependent, in part, on prevailing economic and competitive conditions and
certain legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to maintain sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our
debt commitments, our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be materially adversely impacted.
    We use cash provided by operations, commercial paper issuances, bank term loans, committed revolving credit facilities, debt issuances, and
equity issuances to meet our funding needs. Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors, including our financial results, their
view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the global economy. Any significant additional
indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt. Actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining, upgrading or
downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade. If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, place
us on a watch list, or if there are adverse market conditions, including disruptions in the commercial paper market, the impacts could include
reduced access to the commercial paper, credit and capital markets, an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank
credit facility, or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets. Refer to "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
more information on our credit rating profile.
    In addition, a significant number of our operating subsidiaries are not guarantors of our indebtedness. In the event that any non-guarantor
subsidiary becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves, or otherwise winds up, the assets of such subsidiary will be used to satisfy the
claims of its creditors. The non-guarantor subsidiaries have no direct obligations in respect of our indebtedness and therefore, a direct claim
against any non-guarantor subsidiary and any claims to enforce payment on our indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims
of the creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.
Exchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.
    We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance.
Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Russian
ruble and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are denominated, which may affect our business input costs and
proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity
functional currencies to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and
expenses. In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the Euro, the United Kingdom
Pound Sterling, the Australian Dollar, the Chinese Yuan, and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.
    Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly due to a variety of factors. In addition, we have recognized foreign
exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See
Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary
accounting.
    To the extent currency devaluation occurs across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-
denominated input costs across our business, which would adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future
exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our
19
reported cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations, the effect of which may be material. Our Board of Directors has approved a
hedging policy to limit and manage the risk of such foreign exchange fluctuations, however, if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our
foreign currency risks, if we are under-hedged, or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have an
adverse impact on our results of operations.
Interest Rates — Rising interest rates increase our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have other negative impacts.
     As of June 30, 2022, approximately fifty percent of our indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, our
debt service obligations increase on our variable rate indebtedness even though the amount borrowed remains the same. Increases in short-term
interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. We manage exposure to interest rates by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates, and, where appropriate, entering into various derivative instruments. However, if our
derivative instruments are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk, if we are under-hedged, or if a hedge provider defaults on their
obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
    In addition, rising interest rates could reduce the attractiveness of cash management programs we use, such as customer and supply chain
finance programs, which could negatively impact our cash and working capital and increase our borrowings. Refer to Note 14, "Debt," of the
notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings. Also refer to "Item 7A - Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," including interest rate risk, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse
effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.
    As of June 30, 2022, we had $6.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once
a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods
allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause
our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets
for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would
lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect
on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting
estimate. See "Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Critical Accounting
Estimates and Judgments," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Internal Controls — If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately
report our financial results which may adversely affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.
    We have been subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("SOX") since fiscal year 2020. While our internal
controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in SOX, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements as any controls or procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance from
misstatement. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with our listing on the NYSE
in 2019 related to U.S. GAAP expertise and segregation of duties within key information technology systems which were remediated in fiscal
years 2020 and 2021, respectively.
    There can be no assurance that we will not identify new material weaknesses in the future. Any newly identified material weaknesses could
limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confidence, and have a negative impact on
the trading price of our common stock.
Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, may not provide adequate protection against all of
the risks we face.
    We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our
insurance is placed in the insurance market with third-party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover a variety of risk
exposures, including property damage. Although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice, they may
not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any
20
claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels in
the future.
    Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in
Singapore. Our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups, and assumes specific risks relating to various
risk exposures, including property damage. The captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed
the captive's reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Legal and Compliance Risks
Intellectual Property — Our inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us could
have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.
    Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed
intellectual property. We own a number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and
we own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution
of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology. If we are unable to detect the
infringement of our intellectual property or to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer. The use of our
intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages, cause us to lose sales or
otherwise harm our business.
    We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright,
and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to
obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into
with us. Our pending patent applications, and our pending trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge
the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. Our competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights
or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. In addition, our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may not
provide us a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, many of the countries in which we operate, particularly the emerging markets, do
not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate,
such as the United States and the European Union. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely
impact our business.
    Similarly, while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual
property rights, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future. If we were held liable for a claim of infringement, we
could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. Intellectual property litigation, which could result
in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us
to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights. We may not
prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
Failure to protect our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.
Litigation — Litigation, including product liability claims, or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations, and
financial performance.
    We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising
out of the ordinary course of our business. Given our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment.
The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain.
Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could
require substantial payments. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of
COVID-19 or the Russia-Ukraine conflict, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Refer to "Item 3. - Legal Proceedings" of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.    
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Practices — Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and
governments with respect to our ESG practices and commitments may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.
21
    There is an increased scrutiny from shareholders, customers, and governments on corporate ESG practices. Our commitment to sustainability
and ESG practices remains at the core of our business and we have established goals and targets related to our commitment. However, our ESG
practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our large,
global customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to
support customers in achieving these reductions, customers may seek out competitors who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or
perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all parties, including with meeting our own climate-related and other ESG target ambitions, could
cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. New government regulations
could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may result in increased expenditures for environmental
controls, new taxes on the products we produce and significantly increase our compliance costs to meet new disclosure requirements.
Environmental, Health, and Safety regulations — Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters, including
climate change, may adversely affect our company.
    Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and
climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased
environmental legislation or regulation, including regulations related to extended producer responsibility ("EPR"), could result in higher costs for
us in the form of higher raw material cost, increased energy and freight costs, and new taxes on packaging products or result in reduced demand.
It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. Government bans of, or restrictions on certain
materials or packaging formats may close off markets to Amcor's business. Mandates to use certain types of materials, such as post-consumer
recycled ("PCR") content, may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for those materials as current recycling rates may be insufficient to
meet increased demand for PCR within and beyond the packaging industry.
    We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable
portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated markets. If we fail to comply
with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Tax Law Changes —Changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial
condition and results of operation.
    We are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws and regulations are complex and the
determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. We
are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax.
Our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than
anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate. In addition, certain tax policy efforts, including any tax
law changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") and the G20's inclusive framework on Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS"), could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense. Despite the publication of the Anti Global
Base Erosion model rules and initial commentary, there are many open points to be clarified and there is still significant uncertainty, which we
will continue to monitor until a more conclusive assessment will be possible.
Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares
Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and
transparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S.
corporations.
    We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy,
France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English
corporate law principles. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law, including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as
amended, and by the Amcor Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time. These rights differ in some respects from the rights
of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel
Islands, will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the
U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.
22
U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us.
    A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of
jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the United States upon
those non-U.S. directors and officers, or to enforce judgments realized in the United States.
    Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the
U.S., including those in Australia and Jersey, may be subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action
brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., including Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the securities laws of the U.S.
Additionally, our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought
against us, the Royal Court of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty
by our directors and officers, actions arising out of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, or actions asserting a claim against our directors
or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on
claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction
over such claims. However, there is uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming
breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.

Overview
    Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-
care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them,
differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are
focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled
content. During fiscal year 2022, Amcor generated $14.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned 221 locations in over 40 countries.    
Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented
Impact of COVID-19
    We continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic on all aspects of our business. The
COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent regional government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and non-essential services
resulting in a period of historic uncertainty and challenges. We remain focused on our commitment to the health and safety of our employees as
our first priority. We expect to continue to evaluate our response and related precautions until the COVID-19 pandemic has been fully resolved as
a public health crisis.
    We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. Our
facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that
our facilities will remain operational given the essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our
facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including temporary closures of our facilities
due to outbreaks of the virus among our workforce or government mandates.
    We continue to believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably
estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results. The
ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain,
the implementation of further social distancing measures and other government-imposed restrictions, as well as the nature and pace of
macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.
Raw Material, Inflation, and Supply Chain Trends
    During fiscal year 2022, we experienced persistent supply shortages and price volatility of certain resins and raw materials in both of our
reportable segments as a result of market dynamics that first materialized in the second half of fiscal year 2021 and higher rates of regional
inflation impacting energy, fuel, and labor costs. The underlying causes for the volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the
ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in labor shortages and transportation constraints, energy shortages and weather disruptions
impacting raw material supply in certain regions. The complex factors driving ongoing market volatility continue and could be further
exacerbated by the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We intend to continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers,
leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply and other resulting issues.
South Africa Fire
    On July 13, 2021, our Durban, South Africa, manufacturing facility was destroyed by fire associated with general civil unrest. The facility
employed 350 individuals and no employees were injured as the facility had been closed in advance of the disturbance. In fiscal year 2022, we
recorded $45 million in expense before insurance settlements, primarily related to inventory, property, and equipment losses from the fire and
other related expenses. We have insurance for the majority of property and other losses resulting from the fire and have received $33 million in
insurance settlements in fiscal year 2022.
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of the filing of this annual report. In advance of the invasion,
we proactively suspended operations at our small manufacturing site in Ukraine. We also operate three manufacturing facilities in Russia. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, after a thorough review of our strategic options, we committed to sell our Russian operations, which resulted in
a non-cash $90 million impairment charge.
29
    Since our decision in March 2022 to scale back our Russian operations, we have remained committed to continuing to support our Russian and
Ukraine employees and customers. We are proactively taking steps to mitigate the financial impact of exiting our Russian operations, including
adjusting our European footprint to reallocate and consolidate volumes from Russia and Ukraine to leverage utilization and deliver enhanced
efficiencies across Central and Western Europe, as well as taking actions to restructure our regional cost base. In addition to the $90 million in
impairment charges on assets held for sale, we incurred $48 million in other impairment charges given the expectation that certain assets not held
for sale in the conflict region will not be recoverable, and $62 million in restructuring and other costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022
related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We expect approximately $30 million in additional restructuring and other costs in fiscal year 2023 related
to our exit decision.
    For further information, refer to Note 4, "Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Expenses, net," Note 6, "Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations," and Note 7, "Restructuring" of "Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
    In connection with the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed
at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. We have exceeded the targeted pre-tax synergies of $180 million by approximately 10%
driven by procurement, supply chain and general and administrative savings as of June 30, 2022.
    The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan was completed by June 30, 2022, with final pre-tax integration cost amounting to $253 million. The total
2019 Bemis Integration Plan cost includes $213 million of restructuring and related expenses, net, and $40 million of general integration
expenses. The net cash expenditures for the plan, including disposal proceeds, are $170 million, of which $40 million relates to general
integration expenses. As part of this Plan, we have incurred $144 million in employee related expenses, $36 million in fixed asset related
expenses, $39 million in other restructuring and $45 million in restructuring related expenses, partially offset by a gain on disposal of a business
of $51 million. In fiscal year 2022, the Plan resulted in net cash outflows of $49 million of which $47 million were payments related to
restructuring and related expenditures. The remaining cash outflow will be primarily incurred in fiscal year 2023.
    
2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan
    On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at
reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint. The Plan included the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to
achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements, as well as overhead cost reductions.
    The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan was completed by June 30, 2021 with total pre-tax restructuring costs of $121 million, of which
$78 million resulted in cash expenditures, with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs.
    For more information about our restructuring plans, refer to Note 7, "Restructuring."
Equity Method Investment - AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG")
    We sold our equity method investment in AMVIG on September 30, 2020, realizing a net gain of $15 million, which was recorded in equity in
income/(loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax in the consolidated statements of income. Prior to the sale and due to impairment indicators
being present for the year ended June 30, 2020, we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of our investment in AMVIG to
the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. We recorded an impairment charge of $26 million
in fiscal year 2020, as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value. Refer to Note 8, "Equity Method and Other Investments."
Highly Inflationary Accounting
    We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine
economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial
results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the U.S. dollar. The transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a
negative impact on monetary balances of $16 million, $19 million, and $28 million that was reflected in the consolidated statements of income
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

ceased operations of $87 million, or (0.7%), negative currency impacts of $249 million, or (1.9%), and pass-through of raw material costs of
$1,530 million, or 11.9%, the increase in net sales for the fiscal year 2022 was $490 million or 3.8%, driven by marginally favorable volumes of
0.4% and favorable price/mix of 3.4%.
    Net income attributable to Amcor plc decreased by $134 million, or by 14.3%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021, mainly as a
result of increased restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net of $140 million, largely due to costs related to the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, and higher tax charges of $39 million, offset by increased gross profit of $88 million.
    Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") decreased by $0.073, or by 12.1%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021, with net
income attributable to ordinary shareholders decreasing by 14.3% and the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding decreasing by
2.6%. The decrease in the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding was due to repurchase of shares under announced share
buyback programs.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
    This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT"),
adjusted net income, and net debt. Such measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These
measures exclude the impact of significant tax reforms, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions,
and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment.
These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of
insurance recovery, certain litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and
certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting
adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments, and impacts related
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
    This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non-
GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external
parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
    We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of
debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows,
potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting
downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources.
    The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have not materially impacted our liquidity position, current and expected cash flows from
operating activities, or available cash. We believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under
our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient
liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and
CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future.
Overview
Year Ended June 30,
($ in millions) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,526 $ 1,461 
Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (527) (233)
Net cash used in financing activities (891) (1,179)
Cash Flow Overview
    Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
    Net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by $65 million, or by 4%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. This
increase was primarily due to higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in fiscal year 2022, partially offset by working capital outflows
compared with fiscal year 2021. The variance in "Other, net" within net cash inflows provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to the
timing of tax payments between periods.
    Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities
    Net cash outflows from investing activities increased by $294 million, or by 126%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. This
increase was primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the disposal of AMVIG, the European hospital supplies business and other non-core
businesses in fiscal year 2021 and higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022.
    Capital expenditures were $527 million for fiscal year 2022, an increase of $59 million compared to $468 million for fiscal year 2021. The
increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the increased capital spending in the Flexibles segment.
    Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
    Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $288 million, or by 24%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. This
decrease is primarily due to higher cash net debt drawdowns compared with fiscal year 2021, partially offset by higher share buybacks and on-
market purchases of own shares in fiscal year 2022.
Net Debt
    We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and
commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the
interest cost of borrowings.
    Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the
short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The
current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.
38
    Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured
indebtedness we can incur to 10.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants
of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial
covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of June 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank
debt facilities.
    Our net debt as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $5.7 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.
Available Financing
    As of June 30, 2022, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $1.4 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working
capital, growth capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates. These facilities mature in April
2025 and April 2027, respectively, and the revolving tranches have two 12-month options available to management to extend the maturity date.
    As of June 30, 2022, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $3.8 billion, of which $2.4 billion had been drawn
(inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). On April 26, 2022, we
terminated the previously existing senior bank debt facilities, and simultaneously, we entered into new three- and five-year syndicated facility
agreements providing an aggregate limit of $3.8 billion. Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under each
agreement to be increased by up to $500 million. For further information, refer to Note 14, "Debt."
    On May 17, 2022, we issued U.S. dollar notes with a principal amount of $500 million and a contractual maturity in May 2025. The notes pay
a coupon of 4.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears.
    On December 15, 2021, we redeemed U.S. private placement notes of a principal amount of $275 million at maturity. The notes carried an
interest rate of 5.95%.
    On July 15, 2021, we redeemed U.S. dollar notes with a principal amount of $400 million that had a contractual maturity of October 15, 2021
and carried an interest rate of 4.50%.
Dividend Payments
    In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $732 million, $742 million, and $761 million, respectively, in dividends.
Credit Rating
    Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating
agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from
a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets and from global financial institutions.
Share Repurchases
    On August 17, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million buyback of ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments
("CDIs"). In addition, on February 1, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an additional $200 million buyback of ordinary shares and CDIs.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased approximately $600 million, excluding transaction costs, or 49 million shares. The
shares repurchased were canceled upon repurchase. Additionally, on August 17, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a further $400 million
buyback of ordinary shares and/or CDIs in the next twelve months.
    We had cash outflows of $143 million, $8 million, and $67 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2022,
2021, and 2020, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of June 30, 2022,
2021, and 2020, we held treasury shares at cost of $18 million, $29 million, and $67 million, representing 2 million, 3 million, and 7 million
shares, respectively.
39
Material Cash Requirements
     Amcor’s material cash requirements for future periods from known contractual obligations are included below. We expect to fund these cash
requirements primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and
equity. These amounts reflect material cash requirements for which we are contractually committed.
•Debt obligations: Refer to Note 14, “Debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt
obligations and the related timing of these expected payments.
•Interest payments: Refer to Note 14, “Debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our
interest payments and the related timing of the expected payments.
•Operating and finance leases: Refer to Note 15, “Leases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our
lease obligations and the related timing of the expected payments.
•Employee benefit plan obligations: Refer to Note 13, “Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans” of the notes to consolidated financial
statements for additional information about our employee benefit plan obligations and the related timing of the expected payments.
•Capital expenditures: As of June 30, 2022, we have $223 million in committed capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2023.
•Other purchase obligations: Amcor has other purchase obligations, including commitments to purchase a specified minimum amount of
goods, inclusive of raw materials, utilities, and other. These obligations are legally binding and non-cancellable. Where we are unable to
determine the periods in which these obligations could be payable under these contracts, we present the cash requirement in the earliest
period in which the minimum obligation could be payable. The estimated future cash outlays are approximately $1.6 billion, $550
million, $500 million, $300 million, and $100 million in fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
    Other than as described under "Material Cash Requirements" as of June 30, 2022, we had no significant off-balance sheet contractual
obligations or other commitments.
Liquidity Risk and Outlook
    Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to
financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have
access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our business, the aim is to maintain flexibility within
our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. The following
guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:
•maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
•regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing, and financing
activities;
•generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;
•maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;
•managing credit risk related to financial assets;
•monitoring the duration of long-term debt;
•only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
•to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.
    In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we terminated our 3-, 4-, and 5-year syndicated facility agreements. The three facility agreements
collectively provided $3.8 billion of credit facilities. On the same day, we entered into three- and five-year syndicated facility agreements that
each provide a revolving credit facility of $1.9 billion, $3.8 billion in total. The facilities are unsecured and have contractual maturities in April
2025 and April 2027, respectively. The agreements include customary terms and conditions for a syndicated facility of this nature, and the
revolving tranches have two 12-month options available to management to extend the maturity date.
    As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, was drawn under commercial paper
programs. However, such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in April 2025 ($1.9 billion),
and April 2027 ($1.9 billion), with an option to extend, under which we had $1.4 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 2022.
40
    We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as
outlined above and to finance our capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed. We expect to continue to fund our
long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the
business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis.
We decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on, among other factors, the return on investment
after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity planning covering a
period of four years post the current fiscal year. Our long-term access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability
of funding in financial markets.
41
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those
related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
    We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
•the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities;
•valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
•calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions; and
•valuation of assets and liabilities held for sale.
Pension Costs
    Approximately 90% of our principal defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals. The accounting for defined benefit
pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of
our pension amounts relates to our defined benefit plans in the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Net periodic pension cost
recorded in fiscal year 2022 was $12 million, compared to pension cost of $15 million in fiscal year 2021 and $10 million in fiscal year 2020. We
expect net periodic pension cost before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $9 million. 
    For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of
return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates,
and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are
highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions, and
contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of
valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates
that were based on the critical assumptions.
    The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the
consolidated balance sheets as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income/(loss). Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on
updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent
corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of
active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits
are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statements of income separately
from the service cost component and outside operating income.
    We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement
date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party
indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds, we have used a government bond
approach to set the discount rate. Additionally, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering
the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term return assumption is then derived for each
plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill
    Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. Goodwill
is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units
each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as an operating
segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have six reporting units, of which five are
included in our Flexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reportable segment is Rigid Packaging.
    Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances
indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an
impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits,
limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.
    In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If
we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test, we derive an estimate of
fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches. The most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated
fair value of the reporting units are revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.
    Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated
balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing
whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings,
adverse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, may result in the
need for more frequent assessments.
    Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks, and software and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 20 years. We review these intangible assets for impairment as
changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to
make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates. These estimates and projections
require judgments as to future events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.
Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions
    We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of
uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the
position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained
upon settlement. Significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit.
Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might
result in the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards if we do not
reach
43
the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of
operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation
allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we
may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results
of operations.
Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
    Disposal groups held for sale are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values less cost to sell to their carrying values. The fair
values of disposal groups held for sale are estimated using accepted valuation techniques which include earnings multiples, discounted cash
flows, and indicative bids. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the
forecasting of sales, expenses, and a variety of other factors. We consider historical experience, guidance received from third parties, and all other
information available at the time the estimates are made to derive fair value. However, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the
divestiture of a business may significantly differ from the estimated fair value recognized in our consolidated financial statements, especially for
disposal groups located within countries at war.

Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Overview
    Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential
adverse effects of these risks on Amcor's financial performance. From time to time, we enter into various derivative financial instruments, such as
foreign exchange contracts, commodity fixed price swaps (on behalf of customers), and interest rate swaps to manage these risks. Our hedging
activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities, which provide guidelines for
control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with
movements in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices, and to fixed and variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify
for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility. However, we do not trade in derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entity's
functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which do not qualify for hedge
accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility.
    There have been no material changes in the risks described below, other than increased volatility in connection with the Russia-Ukraine
conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, related to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and
commodity price risk, and credit risk.
Interest Rate Risk
    Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest
rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of various interest rate
derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate locks.
    An increase of 1% in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both derivative and non-derivative instruments
denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, the currencies with the largest interest rate sensitivity, outstanding as of June 30, 2022, would have
resulted in an adverse impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in income/(loss) of affiliated companies of
$29 million expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Foreign Exchange Risk
    We operate in over 40 countries across the world and, as a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
    For the year ended June 30, 2022, a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1% in the underlying average foreign currency
exchange rate for the Euro would have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of $25 million.
    During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 49% and 48% of our net sales, respectively, were effectively generated in U.S. dollar functional currency
entities. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 17% and 18% of net sales, respectively, were generated in Euro functional currency entities with the
remaining 34% and 34% of net sales, respectively, being generated in entities with functional currencies other than U.S. dollars and Euros. The
impact of translating Euro and other non-U.S. dollar net sales and operating expenses into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending
on the movement of those currencies from period to period.
Raw Material and Commodity Price Risk
    The primary raw materials for our products are resins, film, aluminum, and chemicals. We have market risk primarily in connection with the
pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price
risk.
    Changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities, including resins, film, aluminum, inks, solvents, adhesives and liquids, and other
raw materials, may result in a temporary or permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income/(loss) of affiliated
companies depending on the level of recovery by material type. The level of recovery depends both on the type of material and the market in
which we operate. Across our business, we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to
customers within predefined periods.
45
    A 1% increase on average prices for resins, film, aluminum, and liquids, not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment, would
have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an adverse impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in
income (loss) of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 of $74 million and $58 million, respectively.
Credit Risk
    Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. We are exposed to credit
risk arising from financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial
instruments, as well as from over-the-counter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments.
    We manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through our counterparty risk policy, which provide guidelines on setting
limits to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and
settlement procedures. The investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each
specific counterparty. Financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions. As of
June 30, 2022 and 2021, we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our
hedging and risk management activities.

Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amcor plc
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amcor plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred
to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June
30,2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
47
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of assets and liabilities held for sale
As described in Notes 2, 4, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company classified
the assets and liabilities of its three manufacturing facilities in Russia (“Russian business”) as held for sale, as a result of the Company's decision
to sell its Russian operations. The Company has recorded an impairment charge of $90 million as of June 30, 2022, within the line item
“Restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net” on the consolidated statements of income. Assets and liabilities held for sale are reported
at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on management’s assessment of indicative bids, a
market multiples model in which a market multiple is applied to forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(“EBITDA”), discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending on the specific situation.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities held for sale is a
critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the Russian business and a high
degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to
market multiples and forecasted EBITDA.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s valuation of assets
and liabilities held for sale. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value
estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the market multiples model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in
the model and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to market multiples and forecasted
EBITDA. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to market multiples and forecasted EBITDA involved evaluating whether the
assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Russian business; (ii) the consistency
with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
subsidiaries for which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ("U.S. GAAP").
    Certain amounts in the Company's notes to consolidated financial statements may not add or recalculate due to rounding.
Business Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of
consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has
the ability to record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of
the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent
adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: The Company classifies assets and liabilities (the "disposal group") as held for sale in the period
when all of the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale are met. Criteria include management commitment to sell the disposal group in its
present condition and the sale being deemed probable of being completed within one year. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their
carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on management’s assessment of indicative bids, a market multiples
model in which a market multiple is applied to forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), discounted
cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending on the specific situation. Any loss resulting from the measurement is
recognized in the period the held for sale criteria are met. If the disposal group meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within the
reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on its relative fair value. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any
costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value
of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial carrying value of the disposal group. Assets held for sale are
not amortized or depreciated. The Company recorded an impairment charge on assets held for sale of $90 million for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2022.
    A disposal group that represents a strategic shift to the Company or is acquired with the intention to sell is reflected as a discontinued operation
on the consolidated statements of income and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses as income from discontinued operations.
The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a
discontinued operation in fiscal year 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European
Commission. The plants were divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
    See Note 6, "Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations," for more information on assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
Estimates and Assumptions Required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
    These estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management
evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their impacts
cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presented.
    
Translation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s
subsidiaries is generally the local currency of each entity. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the entity’s functional
currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses related to short-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income, net, in the consolidated statements of income and
the net gains or net losses are not
55
material in any of the periods presented. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income, net in the
consolidated statements of income. These foreign currency transaction net gains or net losses amounted to a net gain of $19 million, a net loss of
$4 million, and a net gain of $21 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
    Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are
translated using average exchange rates in effect during each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the
U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, while equity balances are translated at historical rates. Translation
gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.
Highly Inflationary Accounting: A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately
100 percent or more over a three-year period. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting
purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries in Argentina. The
impact of highly inflationary accounting on monetary balances was a loss of $16 million, $19 million, and $28 million for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible and rigid packaging, serving a variety of
markets including food, consumer products, and healthcare end markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with customers,
including quality agreements, pricing agreements, and master supply agreements, which outline the terms under which the Company does
business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Company has concluded for
the vast majority of its revenues, that its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combination of a purchase order with a
master supply agreement. All revenue recognized in the consolidated statements of income is considered to be revenue from contracts with
customers.
    The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred
to customers. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are
subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company does not have any material contract assets or contract liabilities. The Company
disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 21, "Segments."
Significant Judgments
    Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus
together may require significant judgment. The Company identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements
and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from the supplied packaging. Therefore, the
Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.
    The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms, which are determined through its agreements with customers. The
Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates, or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive
payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume. The Company accounts for variable
consideration using the most likely amount method. The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer
agreement and updates its judgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.
    The Company enters into long-term agreements with certain customers, under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for
which it expects to receive a benefit in excess of the cost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and reflected in
prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheets. Contract incentives are typically
recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement.
Practical Expedients
    The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any external sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the
amortization period would be one year or less. External sales commission expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in
the consolidated statements of income.
56
    The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are classified as a
component of cost of sales while amounts billed to customers are classified as a component of net sales.
    The Company excludes from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on
and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction and collected from the customer, including sales taxes, value added taxes, excise
taxes, and use taxes. Accordingly, the tax amounts are not included in net sales.
    The Company does not adjust the promised consideration for the time value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of
payment and performance is one year or less.
Research and Development: Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company calculates severance obligations based on
its standard customary practices. Accordingly, the Company records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has
committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard customary practice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are
recognized when incurred. If fixed assets become impaired as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, these assets are written down to
their fair value less costs to sell, as the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in use. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed
assets for the period of time the asset continues to be used until the asset ceases to be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate
equipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the service is provided. See Note 7, "Restructuring," for more information on the
Company’s restructuring plans.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash: The Company considers all highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include demand deposits that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the
Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value. The Company had restricted cash of $8 million
and $23 million at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was held in a share trust associated with Company share-based payment
obligations.
Trade Receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts ("Trade accounts receivable, net"): Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at
the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the current expected credit loss model
("CECL") and it incorporates information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions. When determining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of factors are evaluated, including: customer
creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical
collection experience, current economic industry trends, and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when
determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts were not material for fiscal years ended
June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
    The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time, including customer-based supply-chain financing programs, to sell trade
receivables to third-party financial institutions. Agreements which result in true sales of the transferred receivables, which occur when
receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the consolidated balance
sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Agreements that
allow the Company to maintain effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale are accounted for as
secured borrowings and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated
with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statements of income primarily as a reduction of net sales. The Company did not
factor any trade receivables in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 which did not qualify as true sales of the receivables.
Inventories, net: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based upon the first-in, first-out
("FIFO") method or average cost method. Costs related to inventories include raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.
57
    Inventories, net are summarized as follows:
($ in millions) June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021
Raw materials and supplies $ 1,161 $ 905 
Work in process and finished goods 1,389 1,193 
Less: inventory reserves (111) (107)
Inventories, net $ 2,439 $ 1,991 
Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net ("PP&E"): PP&E is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and includes
expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of
constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or
extend economic life are expensed as incurred.
    PP&E, including assets held under finance leases, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets or, in
the case of leasehold improvements and finance leases, over the period of the lease or useful life of the asset as described below. The Company
periodically reviews these estimated useful lives and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively.
Leasehold land Over lease term
Land improvements Up to 30 years
Buildings Up to 45 years
Machinery and equipment Up to 25 years
Finance leases Lease term or 5 - 25 years
Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily PP&E and certain identifiable intangible assets with finite
lives, for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If impairment
indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the carrying values are
reduced to the estimated fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as
applicable.
    Impairment of long-lived assets recognized in the consolidated statements of income, excluding assets held for sale, were as follows:
Years ended June 30,
($ in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 
Restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net 42 9 21 
Total impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statements of income $ 43 $ 10 $ 22 
Leases: The Company enters into leasing arrangements for certain manufacturing sites, offices, warehouses, land, vehicles, and equipment. The
Company determines at the inception of the contract whether the contract is or contains a lease. A contract is a lease if it conveys the right to
control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
    For leases with an original term of more than twelve months, the Company recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability. Short-
term leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the related expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
    Lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease terms,
which include any noncancellable lease terms and any renewal periods that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. A significant portion
of the leases of the Company includes an option or options to extend the lease term. The Company re-evaluates its leases on a regular basis to
consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising lease renewal options. As the implicit rates in Company's leases generally cannot be
readily determined, the Company uses estimates of its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rates to determine the lease liabilities.
58
    Certain leases require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or other factors. Variable lease payments that do not depend on
an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU lease asset and lease liability and recognized as an expense in
the period in which the obligation for the payments occur.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized,
but instead tested annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the fiscal year. Among the
factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporting unit’s operating results significantly declining relative to its operating plan or
historical performance, and competitive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operates.
    All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the operating segment. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the
Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas
operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. With this change, the Company has six reporting units with
goodwill that are assessed for potential impairment.
    In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to
perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The Company's quantitative assessment utilizes
present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill. Determining fair value using
discounted cash flows requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and market factors. Key assumptions
relate to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. If current expectations of future growth rates
and margins are not met, or if market factors outside of Amcor’s control, such as factors impacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or
political conditions in key markets change significantly, then goodwill allocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired.
    The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth fiscal quarter of each fiscal year.
    A qualitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fiscal quarter for five of the Company's six reporting units in fiscal year 2022
and 2021. The Company elected to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test for one Flexibles reporting unit in fiscal year 2022 and 2021,
and performed a quantitative impairment test for all of its reporting units in fiscal year 2020. The Company’s annual impairment analyses for all
three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Quantitative impairment analyses performed during the last three fiscal years
concluded that the fair values of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. No reporting units failed the assessments noted
above in the annual impairment analysis for 2022.
    The Company's decision to sell its three manufacturing facilities in Russia (“Russian business”) in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and
subsequent classification as held for sale was considered a triggering event which required an additional quantitative impairment test for one
Flexibles reporting unit to assess if goodwill is impaired. Based on the quantitative impairment test performed for this Flexibles reporting unit,
the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Additionally, the Company considered whether any other events and/or changes in
circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its other reporting units may have been impaired. Management has
determined that no such events have occurred subsequent to the annual evaluation and as of June 30, 2022.
Other Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company
in each reporting period.
    Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer
software within other intangible assets.
Fair Value Measurements: The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities reflect the amounts that would be received
to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
Company determines fair value based on a three-tiered fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of:
59
•Level 1: fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date;
•Level 2: fair value measurements are determined using input prices that are directly observable for the asset or liability or
indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data; and
•Level 3: fair value measurements are determined using unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for
the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.
Derivative Instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The impact on
earnings from recognizing the fair values of these instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in
offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair
value through income. Depending on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are either offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders’ equity
through other comprehensive income/(loss) until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any
hedge are recognized through earnings over the life of the hedging relationship.
    See Note 12, "Derivative Instruments," for more information regarding specific derivative instruments included on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements,
among other derivative instruments.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans to which it makes contributions on behalf of employees.
The expense under such plans was $79 million, $68 million, and $64 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020,
respectively.
    The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans that provide benefits to current and former employees. For the company-sponsored
plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan
assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates, and other
assumptions. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are
highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions, and
contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of
valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by the Company’s actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from
the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
    The Company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan in the consolidated balance sheets. Each overfunded plan is
recognized as an asset in employee benefit assets and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability in employee benefit obligations. Pension
plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about
the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are
amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average
life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The
other components of net benefit cost other than service cost are recorded within other non-operating income, net in the consolidated statements of
income.
Equity Method and Other Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company believes it exercises significant
influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is
carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and is adjusted for
impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. The fair value of the
investment then becomes the new cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. The Company sold its
equity investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, refer to Note 8, "Equity Method and Other
Investments."
    All equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market adjustments included in net income. The Company utilizes the measurement alternative for
equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost adjusted for impairments and
observable price changes in orderly transactions. To date, investments not accounted for under the equity method are not material.
60
Contingencies: The Company is subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as legal and administrative
proceedings, environmental claims and proceedings, workers' compensation, and other claims. Accruals for estimated losses are recorded by the
Company at the time information becomes available indicating that losses are probable and that the amounts can be reasonably estimated. When
management can reasonably estimate a range of losses it may incur, it records an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes its best
estimate. If no amount within a range appears to be a better estimate than any other, the low end of the range is accrued. The Company records
anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is probable.
Share-based Compensation: Amcor has a variety of equity incentive plans. For employee awards with a service or market condition,
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated
number of awards that are expected to vest. For awards with a performance condition, the Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each
reporting period and adjusts compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company also has immaterial cash-settled share-based
compensation plans which are accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The
Company estimates forfeitures based on employee level, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.
Income Taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet
date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the consolidated
financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain
items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.
    Deferred tax assets, including operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management assesses the need to
accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple
jurisdictions. Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if
any, as tax expense in the tax provision. See Note 17, "Income Taxes," for more information on the Company's income taxes.

Note 3 - New Accounting Guidance
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
    In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and
improving the consistent application of U.S. GAAP in other tax accounting areas. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and any
interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The guidance became effective
for the Company on July 1, 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
    In November 2021, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-10 that adds certain disclosure requirements for entities
that receive government assistance. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 with early application
permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on July 1, 2022 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
    The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. The Company determined at this time that all other
ASUs not yet adopted are either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring and related expenses, net $ (96)$ (94)$ (115)
Impairment expenses (138) — — 
Restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net $ (234)$ (94)$ (115)
    Restructuring and related expenses, net includes expenses related to the Company's 2019 plan focused on the integration of acquired Bemis
operations which was complete at the end of fiscal year 2022, expenses related to the 2018 plan to restructure the Company's rigid packaging
operations, and restructuring expenses associated with the Company's decision to sell its Russian business. For further information, refer to Note
7, "Restructuring."
    Impairment expenses of $138 million were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 as a result of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict. In the
fourth quarter, the Company approved a plan to sell its Russian operations which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $90 million. For
further information, refer to Note 6, "Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations." In addition, the Company recognized other expenses of
$48 million, given the expectation that certain assets not held for sale in the conflict region will not be recoverable. The Company's
manufacturing plant in Ukraine ceased operations in February 2022 and has not resumed operations given the ongoing conflict in the region has
displaced the Company's employees, destroyed nearby manufacturing facilities, and impaired the region's supporting infrastructure. Other asset
impairment expenses in the last three fiscal years were not material and were primarily reported in restructuring and related expenses, net.

Note 5 - Divestitures
Year ended June 30, 2022
    During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the disposal of non-core assets in the Flexibles reporting segment. The
Company recorded an expense of $10 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 to adjust the long-lived assets to their fair value less cost
to sell.
Year ended June 30, 2021
    As part of optimizing its portfolio under the 2019 Bemis Integration Plan, the Company completed the disposal of a non-core European
hospital supplies business, which was part of the Flexibles reportable segment. The resulting gain from the sale has been recorded in the line
restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net, in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 4, "Restructuring, Impairment, and
Related Expenses, Net" and Note 7, "Restructuring."
    The Company also completed the disposal of two non-core businesses in India and Argentina in the Flexibles segment during the first quarter
of fiscal year 2021, recording a loss on sale of $6 million, which was primarily driven by the reclassification of cumulative translation
adjustments through the income statements that had previously been recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss).
    The Company sold its equity investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Refer to Note 8,
"Equity Method and Other Investments."
Year ended June 30, 2020
    Closing of the Bemis acquisition was conditional upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders,
and satisfaction of other customary conditions. In order to satisfy certain regulatory approvals, the Company was required to divest three of
Bemis' medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") and three Amcor medical packaging facilities in
the United States ("U.S. Remedy"). The U.S. Remedy was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and the Company received
$214 million resulting in a gain of $159 million. The EC Remedy was completed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the Company
received $397 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $9 million which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency
translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC Remedy.
    In addition, the Company sold an equity method investment acquired through the Bemis acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 for
proceeds of $28 million. There was no gain or loss on sale as the investment was recorded at fair value upon acquisition.

Note 6 - Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
    During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company classified the assets and liabilities of its Russian business as held for sale as a result
of the Company's decision to sell its Russian business. The Russian business is part of the Company’s Flexibles segment and is expected to be
sold within one year. The Company has recorded an impairment of $90 million as of June 30, 2022, within the line item restructuring,
impairment, and related expenses, net on the consolidated statements of income. The disposal of the Russian business will not represent a
strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as a
discontinued operation.
    Major classes of assets and liabilities of the Russian business classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2022 were as follows:
($ in millions) June 30, 2022
Cash and cash equivalents $ 75

    This table excludes other assets and liabilities held for sale but not part of the Russian business and that are not material for disclosure.
    On February 11, 2019, the Company received approval from the European Commission ("EC") for the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.
("Bemis"). A condition of the approval was an agreement to divest three Bemis medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and
Ireland ("EC Remedy"). Upon completion of the Bemis acquisition on June 11, 2019, the Company determined that the EC Remedy met the
criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations." The sale of the EC Remedy
closed on August 8, 2019. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of $9 million, which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated
foreign currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC
Remedy.

Note 7 - Restructuring
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
    In connection with the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), the Company initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of
2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization.
    The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan was completed by June 30, 2022 with final pre-tax integration cost amounting to $253 million. The total
2019 Bemis Integration Plan cost includes $213 million of restructuring and related expenses, net, and $40 million of general integration
expenses. The net cash expenditures for the plan, including disposal proceeds, are $170 million, of which $40 million relates to general
integration expenses. As part of this Plan the Company has incurred $144 million in employee related expenses, $36 million in fixed asset related
expenses, $39 million in other restructuring and $45 million in restructuring related expenses, partially offset by a gain on disposal of a business
of $51 million. In fiscal year 2022, the Plan resulted in net cash outflows of $49 million of which $47 million were payments related to
restructuring and related expenditures. The remaining cash outflow will be primarily incurred in fiscal year 2023.
    Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as
exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related
costs provides more information on the total cost of the 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the
closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment, and losses on sale of closed facilities.
2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan
    On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan")
aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint. The Plan included the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount
reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions.
    The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan was completed by June 30, 2021 with total pre-tax restructuring costs of $121 million, of which
$78 million resulted in cash expenditures, with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs.
Other Restructuring Plans
    The Company has entered into other restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). The Company's restructuring charges related to these
plans were $59 million, $6 million, and $18 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded $57 million in restructuring and related expenses classified within Other Restructuring Plans
triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict to help mitigate the impact of the Russian sale.

Note 8 - Equity Method and Other Investments
    Investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
influence, with usually not more than 50% voting interest. The Company sold its only significant equity method investment, a 47.6% interest in
AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") on September 30, 2020, realizing a net gain of $15 million, which was recorded in equity in
income/(loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax in the consolidated statements of income.
    As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, investments accounted for under the equity method and other investments carried at cost are immaterial. The
Company received no dividends from equity method investments in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. During the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2020, the Company received dividends of $10 million from AMVIG.
    The Company reviews its investments accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Due to impairment indicators present in fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company
performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of its investment in AMVIG to its fair value, which was determined based on
AMVIG's quoted share price. The fair value of the investment dropped below its carrying value during fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and
therefore the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $26 million to bring the value of its investment to fair value. The
impairment charge was included in equity in income/(loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income.

Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements
    The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the
assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
    The Company's non-derivative financial instruments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term
debt, and long-term debt. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximated
fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
    Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarchy. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," for information about the
Company's fair value hierarchy.
    The carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial
liabilities with similar risk profiles.
    The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (including fixed-rate debt with designated receive-
fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps, excluding finance leases) were as follows:

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
    Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase
consideration liabilities, at fair value. The following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments, which are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy:

Liabilities
Contingent purchase consideration liabilities $ — $ — $ 18 $ 18 
Forward exchange contracts — 4 — 4 
Total liabilities measured at fair value $ — $ 4 $ 18 $ 22 
    The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and
observed market forward prices discounted at a currency specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points. The fair value of the interest rate
swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market based swap yield curves, taking into account current interest rates.
    Contingent purchase consideration obligations arise from business acquisitions. As of June 30, 2022, the Company's contingent purchase
consideration liabilities consist of a $10 million liability that is contingent on future royalty income generated by Discma AG, a subsidiary
acquired in March 2017, with the $6 million balance relating to consideration for small business acquisitions where payments are contingent on
the Company vacating a certain property or performance criteria. The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities was
determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value was determined using the income approach with significant inputs that are not
observable in the market. Key assumptions include the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted
financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustment over the life for changes in risks and
probabilities. Changes arising from modifications in forecasts related to contingent consideration are expected to be immaterial.
    The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities, which was included in other income,
net is due to the passage of time and changes in the probability of achievement used to develop the estimate.
    The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities:

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
    In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on
a nonrecurring basis. The Company measures certain assets, including technology intangible assets, equity method and other investments, long-
lived assets held for sale, and other long-lived and intangible assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than
temporarily impaired. The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information
available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
72
    As further discussed in Note 6 – “Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,” during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company met
the criteria to recognize the related assets and liabilities of its Russian operations as held for sale which resulted in the Company remeasuring the
disposal group at its fair value, less cost to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.
    In addition, resulting from the effective disposal of non-core businesses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company has recorded
a total loss of $34 million, predominantly to adjust the long-lived assets to their fair value less cost to sell. Of these losses, $24 million are
included within restructuring, impairment, and related expenses, net as relating to the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the balance recorded in other
income, net in the consolidated statements of income. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, further long-lived assets with a carrying value
of $12 million were written down to a fair value of zero as the Company's Durban, South Africa, manufacturing facility was destroyed in a fire as
the result of general civil unrest. In addition, other long-lived assets in South Africa, with a carrying amount of $8 million, were written down to
their estimated fair value of $4 million using level 3 inputs.
    
The Company sold its equity method investment in AMVIG on September 30, 2020. Refer to Note 8, "Equity Method and Other
Investments."
    The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no indefinite-lived intangible impairment
charges recorded.

    The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and currency
risks. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting
criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the instruments as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge of a specific
underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are expected to continue to be
highly effective.
Interest Rate Risk
    The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring
global interest rates, and, where appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate
derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate locks. For interest rate
swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, the gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are
included in interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in
market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income in other non-operating income, net.
    During December 2021, the Company entered into an aggregate $250 million notional amount of receive-fixed/pay variable interest rate
swaps, which will mature on May 15, 2028. These swaps were designated as a fair value hedge against 50% of $500 million of principal on the
4.50% U.S. dollar notes due in May 2028. Also during December 2021, the Company settled $100 million of a receive-fixed/pay-variable interest
rate swap as a result of the full redemption of $275 million 5.95% U.S. private placement notes at maturity. This interest rate swap was
designated as a fair value hedge at inception.
    In July 2021, the Company terminated $400 million of its receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value
hedges and received $2 million in net proceeds. This termination was in association with the full redemption of the $400 million 4.50% U.S.
dollar notes due October 2021, completed on July 15, 2021. In July 2021, the Company also terminated an aggregate amount of €300 million
(equivalent of $357 million) receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps and received €13 million (equivalent of $15 million) in net proceeds.
These interest rate swaps, which were to mature in March 2023, were designated as fair value hedges against €300 million of principal on the
2.75% Euro bonds due March 2023. The gain on the termination of the aforementioned swaps is deferred and is being amortized to interest
income over the remaining contractual term of the 2.75% Euro bonds due March 2023.
    As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $650 million and
$1,257 million, respectively.
Foreign Currency Risk
    The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is
exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the
volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.
    To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash
flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these
instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line
item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in
earnings over the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated statements of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes
in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.
    As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
Commodity Risk
    Certain raw materials used in the Company's production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political
and economic variables, and other unpredictable factors. The Company's policy is to minimize exposure to price volatility by passing through the
commodity price risk to customers, including the use of fixed price swaps.
74
The Company purchases on behalf of customers fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exposure of price volatility on the underlying sales
contracts. These instruments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost or benefit is passed through to customers. Information about
commodity price exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and these exposures are hedged by central treasury units.
Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the consolidated
statements of income when the forecasted transaction is realized.
    The Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts to hedge forecasted purchases:

Note 13 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans
    The Company sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that include statutory and mandated benefit provision in some
countries as well as voluntary plans (generally closed to new joiners). During fiscal year 2022, the Company maintained 20 statutory and
mandated defined benefit arrangements and 57 voluntary defined benefit plans.
    The principal defined benefit plans are structured as follows:

    On October 12, 2021, the Company contracted with Pacific Life Insurance Company to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer
$186 million of its pension plan assets and related benefit obligations. This transaction required a remeasurement of the pension plan assets and
obligations and resulted in the recognition of a $3 million non-cash pension settlement loss in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022.

    Actuarial gains resulting in a decrease to the benefit obligation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, were primarily due to a weighted
average increase in discount rates for our pension plans of 1.7 percentage points. Settlement impact is attributed to group annuity contracts,
primarily a $186 million contract with Pacific Life Insurance Company, and other lump sum transfers and payments.

    Where funded, the Company and, in some countries, the employees make cash contributions into the pension fund. In the case of unfunded
plans, the Company is responsible for benefit payments as they fall due. Plan funding requirements are generally determined by local regulation
and/or best practice and differ between countries. The local statutory funding positions are not necessarily consistent with the funded status
disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets. For any funded plans in deficit (as measured under local country guidelines), the Company agrees
with the trustees and plan fiduciaries to undertake suitable funding programs to provide additional contributions over time in accordance with
local country requirements.

Contributions to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, not including unfunded plans, are expected to be $18 million over the next fiscal
year.

    The ERISA Benefit Plan Committee in the United States, the Pension Plan Committee in Switzerland, and the Trustees of the pension plans in
Canada, Ireland, and UK establish investment policies, investment strategies, allocation strategies, and investment risk profiles for the Company's
pension plan assets and are required to consult with the Company on changes to their investment policy. In developing the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets' historical returns, asset allocations, and the
anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and
historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return.

facilities. On the same day, the Company entered into three- and five-year syndicated facility agreements that each provide a revolving credit
facility of $1.9 billion or $3.8 billion in total. The facilities are unsecured and have contractual maturities in April 2025 and April 2027,
respectively. The agreements include customary terms and conditions for a syndicated facility of this nature, and the revolving tranches have two
12-month options available to management to extend the maturity date.

security for bank and other loans.
Redemption of term debt
    The Company may redeem its long-term debt, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to its maturity. The redemption prices
typically represent 100% of the principal amount of the relevant debt plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, for notes that are
redeemed by the Company before their stated permitted redemption date, a make-whole premium is payable.
    On December 15, 2021, the Company redeemed U.S. private placement notes of a principal amount of $275 million at maturity using the
proceeds from the commercial paper program. The notes carried an interest rate of 5.95%.
    On July 15, 2021, the Company redeemed all $400 million outstanding amount of the 4.50% senior notes due in October 2021 at a price equal
to the principal plus accrued interest.
Priority, Guarantees, and Financial Covenants
    All the notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis
by certain existing subsidiaries that guarantee its other indebtedness.
    The Company's primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of
secured indebtedness the Company can incur to 10.0% of total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. As of June
30, 2022, the Company is required to satisfy certain financial covenants pursuant to its bank debt facilities, which are tested as of the last day of
each quarterly and annual financial period. The covenants require the Company to maintain a leverage ratio of not higher than 3.9 times, which is
calculated as total net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt
covenants.
83
Short-Term Debt
    Short-term debt is generally used to fund working capital requirements. The Company has classified commercial paper as long-term at June

foreign currency translation from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company
recorded a gain on disposal of AMVIG and other non-core businesses. Upon completion of the sales, $ 26 million of accumulated foreign currency
translation was transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Refer to Note 8, "Equity Method and Other Investments" for
further information on the disposal of AMVIG and Note 5, "Divestitures" for more information about the Company's other disposals. The fiscal year
ended June 30, 2020 includes the loss on sale of the EC Remedy of $ 9 million, which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign
currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Refer to Note 6, "Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations"
for more information.
Forward contracts to purchase own shares
    The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exercised.
The Company currently acquires shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments. This
exposes the Company to market price risk.
    To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2022,
the Company has entered into forward contracts that mature between November 2022 and June 2023 to purchase 14 million shares at a weighted
average price of $12.67. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding forward contracts for 8 million shares at a weighted average price of
$11.65 that matured in June 2022.
    The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares are classified as a current liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the
fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present
value of the cost required to settle the contracts.

from business restructuring of $ 45 million and other individually immaterial items.
    Amcor operates in over forty different jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. The tax expense from operating in non-UK
jurisdictions in excess of the UK statutory tax rate is included in the line "Foreign tax rate differential" in the above tax rate reconciliation table.
For fiscal year 2022, the Company's effective tax rate was 26.9% as compared to the effective tax rates of 21.9% and 22.6% for fiscal years 2021
and 2020, respectively, with the increase in fiscal year 2022 predominantly attributable to an increase in tax provisions for uncertain tax
positions. For fiscal year 2021, the Company's effective tax rate was higher than its UK statutory tax rate primarily due to pretax income being
earned in jurisdictions outside
90
of the UK where the applicable tax rates are higher than the UK statutory tax rate. The fiscal year 2020 foreign tax rate differential reflects a
benefit related to Swiss tax law changes, which was mostly offset by current period tax charges related to true-up adjustments. Refer to the
section "Swiss Tax Reform" in this footnote for a discussion of the impacts of the Swiss tax law changes which the Company recognized in the
last three fiscal years.

    The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in jurisdictions for which it does not
believe it is more likely than not to realize those deferred tax assets based upon all available positive and negative evidence, including historical
operating performance, carry-back periods, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and earnings expectations. The
Company's valuation allowance increased by $4 million, by $40 million, and by $73 million for fiscal year 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
    As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total net operating loss carry forwards, including capital losses, in the amount of $1,178
million and $1,085 million, respectively, and tax credits in the amount of $39 million and $40 million, respectively. The vast majority of the
losses and tax credits do not expire.
    The Company considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i)
the forecasts, budgets, and financial requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long-term and for the short-term; and (ii) the
tax consequences of any decision to repatriate or reinvest earnings of any subsidiary. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has not provided
deferred taxes on approximately $1,093 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its
international operations. Upon distribution of such earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental
foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of foreign tax that might be payable. As of June 30, 2022, a cumulative deferred tax
liability of $20 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely
reinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be
repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision for income or withholding taxes on these earnings.
91
    The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." At June 30, 2022 and 2021, unrecognized
tax benefits totaled $195 million and $133 million, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
    The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company's accrual for interest and penalties for these uncertain tax positions was $12 million, $12
million, and $7 million, respectively. The Company does not currently anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will result in
material changes to its financial position within the next 12 months.
    A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years presented is as follows:
June 30,
($ in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Balance at the beginning of the year $ 133 $ 101 $ 102

Reductions for settlements — — (7)
Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (1) (2) (2)
Balance at the end of the year $ 195 $ 133 $ 101 
    The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions and, as such, is required to file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions
globally. The fiscal years 2016 through 2021 remain open for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the fiscal year
2020 remains open for examination by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs ("HMRC"), and the fiscal years 2011 through 2021 are currently
subject to audit or remain open for examination in various tax jurisdictions.
    The Company believes that its income tax reserves are adequately maintained taking into consideration both the technical merits of its tax
return positions and ongoing developments in its income tax audits. However, the final determination of the Company's tax return positions, if
audited, is uncertain and therefore there is a possibility that final resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations or cash flows.
Swiss Tax Reform
    During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Swiss tax laws were changed in order to remove certain tax regimes and replace these with new
measures that are hereafter referred to as "Swiss Tax Reform." In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company obtained confirmation from
local authorities as to the methodology to calculate the future benefits and recorded the impact. The Company recorded a benefit of $22 million at
June 30, 2020 related to a reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes, an additional benefit of
$2 million during fiscal year 2021, and a decrease of $2 million during fiscal year 2022.
92
Note 18 - Share-based Compensation
    The Company's equity incentive plans include grants of share options, restricted shares/units, performance shares, performance rights, and
share rights.
    In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, share options and performance rights or performance shares (awarded to U.S. participants in place of
performance rights) were granted to officers and employees. The exercise price for share options was set at the time of grant. The requisite
service period for outstanding share options, performance rights, or performance shares ranges from two to three years. The awards are also
subject to performance and market conditions. At vesting, share options can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis,
subject to payment of the exercise price. The contractual term of the share options ranges from five to six years from the grant date. At vesting,
performance rights can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Performance shares vest automatically and convert
to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
    Restricted shares/units may be granted to directors, officers, and employees of the Company and vest on terms as described in the award. The
restrictions prevent the participant from disposing of the restricted shares/units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted shares/units
is determined based on the closing price of the Company's shares on the grant date.
    Share rights may be granted to directors, officers, and employees of the Company and vest on terms as described in the award. The restrictions
prevent the participant from disposing of the share rights during the vesting period. The fair value of share rights is determined based on the
closing price of the Company's shares on the grant date, adjusted for dividend yield.
    As of June 30, 2022, 47 million shares were reserved for future grants. The Company uses treasury shares to settle share-based compensation
obligations. Treasury shares are acquired through market purchases throughout the fiscal year for the required number of shares.
    Share-based compensation expense was primarily recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
income. The total share-based compensation expense was as follows:    
For the years ended June 30,
($ in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Share-based compensation expense $ 63 $ 58 $ 34 
    As of June 30, 2022, there was $87 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested share options and other equity
incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
    The weighted-average grant date fair values by type of equity incentive plan for awards granted in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as

(1) The fair value of share options was determined using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following key assumptions for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2022, 2021  and 2020, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 1.0% (2021 : 0.2%, 2020:  1.8%), expected share-price volatility of 22.0% (2021 :
25.0%, 2020:  18.0%), expected dividend yield of 4.1% (2021 : 4.7%, 2020:  4.6%), and expected life of options of 6.1 years (2021 : 6.1 years , 2020:  5.7
years ).
(2) The fair value of performance rights/shares was determined using a combination of Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation.
The key assumptions for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021  and 2020, respectively , were: risk-free interest rate of 0.4% (2021 : 0.2%, 2020:

Note 19 - Earnings Per Share Computations
    The Company applies the two-class method when computing its earnings per share ("EPS"), which requires that net income per share for each
class of share be calculated assuming all of the Company's net income is distributed as dividends to each class of share based on their contractual
rights.
    Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares
outstanding after excluding the ordinary shares to be repurchased using forward contracts. Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options,
restricted shares, performance rights, performance shares, and share rights, if dilutive.

repurchases.

Note 20 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings
Contingencies - Brazil
    The Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise
and income taxes. The Company vigorously defends its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company
does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a
challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or
potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the Company's liquidity. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded
accruals of $12 million and $11 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and has
estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $20 million and $17 million, respectively. The litigation process is
subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these
matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood
of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these
matters may differ from the Company's estimates.
    As of June 30, 2022, the Company provided letters of credit of $36 million, judicial insurance of $1 million and deposited cash of $12 million
with the courts to continue to defend the cases referenced above.
Contingencies - Environmental Matters
    The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several waste disposal sites under U.S.
federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While
the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially, cover the total potential exposures.
The Company has recorded $17 million aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites.
    In addition to the matters described above, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $43 million for potential liabilities for
remediation obligations at various worldwide locations that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.
    The SEC requires the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental
provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC
regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is
required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
    While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments
will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential
environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.
Other Matters
    In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. While the potential financial impact
with respect to these ordinary course matters is subject to many factors and uncertainties, management believes that any financial impact to the
Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operation.

Note 21 - Segments
    The Company's business is organized and presented in the two reportable segments outlined below:
Flexibles: Consists of operations that manufacture flexible and film packaging in the food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, fresh
produce, snack food, personal care, and other industries.
Rigid Packaging: Consists of operations that manufacture rigid containers for a broad range of predominantly beverage and food products,
including carbonated soft drinks, water, juices, sports drinks, milk-based beverages, spirits and beer, sauces, dressings, spreads and personal care
items, and plastic caps for a wide variety of applications.
    Other consists of the Company's undistributed corporate expenses including executive and functional compensation costs, equity method and
other investments, intercompany eliminations, and other business activities.
    Operating segments are organized along the Company's product lines and geographical areas. The Company's five Flexibles operating
segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North America; Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific; and Specialty
Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles reportable segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characteristics and future prospects,
similarity in the products they offer, their production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of their service delivery models, and their
regulatory environments.
    The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") from
continuing operations. The Company defines Adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the
Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income/(loss) of affiliated companies, net of
tax.
    The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of
fiscal year 2021, the Company revised the presentation of adjusted earnings before interest and tax ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing
operations in the reportable segments to include an allocation of certain research and development and selling, general, and administrative
expenses that management previously reflected in Other. The Company refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments
periodically as more relevant information becomes available and to align with industry or market changes. Corporate expenses are allocated to
the reportable segments based primarily on direct attribution. Prior period has been recast to conform to the new cost allocation methodology.

Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
    Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive
and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
    Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of June 30, 2022.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
    Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO framework" (2013)). All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
    Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022.
    The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on "Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 4.16
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
As of June 30, 2022, Amcor plc (“Amcor,” “we,” “our” or “us”) had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): (i) Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share and (ii) 1.125% Guaranteed Senior
Notes due 2027. Each of Amcor’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the
“NYSE”). CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDI’s”) representing our ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”).
DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES
The following is a summary of the material terms of our ordinary shares as set forth in our Articles of Association and the material provisions of
the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of
Association, which are filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.16 is a part.
Share Capital
The authorized share capital of Amcor is $100,000,000, divided into 9,000,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.01 par value each and 1,000,000,000
preferred shares of $0.01 par value each, which may be issued in such class or classes or series as the our board of directors (“board”) may
determine in accordance with our Articles of Association. As of August 16, 2022, we had 1,489,019,556 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.
All ordinary shares have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed income and carry the right to receive dividends that have been declared by
Amcor. The holders of ordinary shares have the right to receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Amcor. The rights and
obligations attaching to any preferred shares will be determined at the time of issue by our board in its absolute discretion and must be set forth in
a statement of rights. Any preferred shares that are issued may have priority over the ordinary shares with respect to dividend or liquidation rights
or both. We do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.
Our board may issue ordinary shares or preferred shares without further shareholder action, unless shareholder action is required by applicable
law or by the rules of the NYSE, ASX or other stock exchange or quotation system on which any class or series of our ordinary shares may be
listed or quoted.
Subject to our Articles of Association and the rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares, if Amcor is wound up and the
property of Amcor available for distribution among the shareholders is more than sufficient to pay (i) all the debts and liabilities of Amcor and
(ii) the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up, the excess must be divided among the shareholders in proportion to the number of shares
held by them, irrespective of the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares. If Amcor is wound up, the directors or liquidator (as applicable)
may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Amcor and any other sanction required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
(the “Jersey Companies Law”), divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets of Amcor and determine how the division will
be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.
CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian law which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system.
For further information regarding the CDIs, see "—CHESS Depositary Interests" below. All references to shares in this summary will be deemed,
where the context permits, also to be references to the CDIs.
Amcor's registered office address and the address where Amcor's register of members is maintained is 3rd Floor 44 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey
JE4 9WG.
Organizational Documents; Governing Law
The rights of Amcor shareholders are governed by, among other things, our Articles of Association and the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands,
including the Jersey Companies Law.
Voting Rights
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to one vote per share at any general meeting of shareholders. An ordinary resolution requires approval by
the holders of a majority of the voting rights represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. A special resolution requires
approval by the holders of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon (or such greater
majority as the Articles of Association may prescribe).
Voting rights with respect to any class of preferred shares (if any) will be determined by our board and set out in the relevant statement of rights
for such class.
Neither Jersey law nor the Articles of Association restrict non-resident shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of our
ordinary shares. There are no provisions in the Jersey Companies Law relating to cumulative voting.
No Preemptive Rights
Amcor shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued ordinary shares.
Variation of Rights
The rights attached to any class of ordinary shares, such as voting, dividends and the like, may, unless their terms of issue state otherwise, be
varied by a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of shares of such class.
Certificated and Uncertificated Shares
Ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Every holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to have
a certificate for the shares that it owns executed under Amcor's seal or in such other manner as provided by the Jersey Companies Law.
Transfer of Shares
Generally, fully paid ordinary shares are issued in registered form and may be freely transferred pursuant to the Articles of Association unless the
transfer is restricted by applicable securities laws or prohibited by another instrument.
Dividends
Our board may declare and pay any dividends from time to time as it may determine. Our board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it
decides, before the payment date, that Amcor's financial position no longer justifies the payment. The payment of a dividend does not require
shareholder confirmation or approval at a general meeting of the shareholders.
Holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to receive equally, on a per share basis, any dividends that may be declared in respect of ordinary
shares by our board.
Our board may direct that a dividend will be satisfied from any available source permitted by law, including wholly or partly by the distribution
of assets, including paid up shares or securities of another company. If Amcor declares cash dividends, such dividends will be declared in U.S.
dollars.
Under the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source permitted by law (other than from nominal capital account and capital
redemption reserve), subject to a requirement for the directors who are to authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statutory solvency
statement.
Our Articles of Association permit our board to require that all dividend payments will be paid only through electronic transfer into an account
selected by the shareholder rather than by a bank check.
No dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share will bear interest as against Amcor (unless the terms of the share specify
otherwise).
If any dividend is unclaimed for 11 calendar months after issuance, our board may stop payment on the dividend or otherwise make use of the
unclaimed amount for the benefit of Amcor until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to the laws relating to unclaimed monies.
Alteration of Share Capital
Under the Jersey Companies Law, Amcor may, by special resolution of its shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divide;
convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of its shares into another currency or reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve or
share premium account in any way.
Redeemable Shares
Our ordinary shares will not initially be redeemable. Pursuant to the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, our board may issue
redeemable shares or convert existing non-redeemable shares, whether issued or not, into redeemable shares, which shares will be, in each case,
redeemable in accordance with their terms or at the option of Amcor and/or at the option of the holder (provided that an issued non-redeemable
share may only be converted into a redeemable share with the agreement of the holder or pursuant to a special resolution).
Purchase of Own Shares
Subject to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, Amcor may purchase its own shares or CDIs and either
cancel them or hold them as treasury shares.
Under Jersey law, Amcor's purchase of its own shares must be sanctioned by a special resolution of Amcor's shareholders. If the purchase is to be
made on a stock exchange, the special resolution must specify the maximum number of shares or CDIs to be purchased, the maximum and
minimum prices which may be paid, and the date on which the authority to purchase is to expire (which may not be more than five years after the
date of the resolution). If the purchase is to be made otherwise than on a stock exchange, the purchase must be made pursuant to a written
purchase contract approved in advance by a resolution of shareholders (excluding the shareholder from whom Amcor proposes to purchase
shares or CDIs).
Shareholder Meetings
Annual Meetings of Shareholders
Under Jersey law, Amcor must hold an annual general meeting once every calendar year and not more than 18 months may elapse between two
successive annual general meetings, at such date, time and place as may be determined by our Board.
A general shareholder meeting may only be called by a resolution of the board or as otherwise provided in the Jersey Companies Law.
Special Meetings of Shareholders
The board may, and upon request of shareholders as required by Jersey law (and as described below) must, convene an extraordinary general
meeting of the shareholders.
Under the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Amcor holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant
meeting may legally require the directors to call a meeting of shareholders. Upon receiving a requisition notice from shareholders, the board must
call a special meeting as soon as practicable but in any case not later than two months after the date of the requisition. If the directors do not
within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the
requisitionists, or any of them representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting
so called may not be held after three months from that date.
Notice of Meetings; Record Date
Under the Articles of Association and applicable stock exchange listing rules, the notice for a general meeting must be sent to all shareholders.
The content of a notice of a general meeting called by the board is to be decided by the board, but it must
designate the meeting as an annual or extraordinary general meeting and must state the general nature of the business to be transacted at the
meeting and any other matters required by the Jersey Companies Law.
For the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a shareholder to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes such person may
cast, Amcor may specify in the notice a date not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date fixed for the meeting, as the date for the
determination of the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at the meeting or appoint a proxy. Amcor may specify a separate
time by which a CDI holder must be on the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee (as defined herein) to vote or appoint a proxy.
Quorum
Under the Articles of Association, no business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of shares representing at
least the majority of total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting) is present in person or by proxy at the time when the
meeting proceeds to business.
Action by Written Consent
The Articles of Association prohibit actions to be taken by unanimous written consent. Under the Articles of Association, any action required or
permitted to be taken by shareholders or any class of them must be effected at a general meeting of Amcor or of the class in question and may not
be effected by any consent or resolution in writing of the shareholders.
Shareholder Proposals
Under Articles of Association, a shareholder of record who has the right to vote at an annual general meeting may, on giving notice to Amcor no
more than 120 days and no less than 90 days before the date which is one year after the date of the previous annual general meeting, require
Amcor to include a resolution to be proposed at the annual general meeting. Any proposed business must be a proper matter for shareholder
action.
In addition, a shareholder of record who has the right to vote at general meetings may propose persons for nomination as directors subject to
complying with the applicable requirements to be set forth in the Articles of Association, including delivery to Amcor of specified information on
director nominees. Shareholder nominations must be made on notice of (i) in the case of annual general meetings, no more than 120 calendar
days and no less than 90 days (in each case from the anniversary date of the preceding annual general meeting), or (ii) in the case of
extraordinary general meetings called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the 10th day following the day on which notice of the
date of such meeting was mailed.
Conditions of Admission
Under the Articles of Association, the board and the chairperson of any general meeting may make any arrangement and impose any requirement
or restriction it or he or she considers appropriate to ensure the safety of persons attending and the orderly conduct of a general meeting
including, without limitation, requirements for identification to be produced by those attending the meeting, searches and the restriction of items
that may be taken into the meeting place. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairperson are entitled to refuse entry to a person who
refuses to comply with these arrangements, requirements or restrictions.
Board of Directors
Election of Directors
Amcor directors are appointed by Amcor's board of directors and shall hold office until the next annual general meeting following such
appointment. Under the Articles of Association, all directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Directors will hold office until the
conclusion of the next annual general meeting following his or her appointment, unless such director is re-elected at the general meeting.
Where the number of persons validly proposed for election or re-election as a director is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the
persons receiving the most votes (up to the number of directors to be elected) will be elected as directors and an absolute majority of votes cast
will not be a pre-requisite to the election of such directors.
Removal of Directors
Under the Articles of Association, a director may only be removed from office by ordinary resolution of Amcor shareholders as a result of:
•the director's conviction (with a plea of nolo contendere deemed to be a conviction) of a serious felony involving moral turpitude or a
violation of U.S. federal or state securities law, but excluding a conviction based entirely on vicarious liability; or
•the director's commission of any material act of dishonesty (such as embezzlement) resulting or intended to result in material personal
gain or enrichment of the director at the expense of the Company or any subsidiary and which act, if made the subject to criminal
charges, would be reasonably likely to be charged as a felony.
For these purposes nolo contendere, felony and moral turpitude have the meaning given to them by the laws of the United States of America or
any relevant state thereof and shall include equivalent acts in any other jurisdiction.
Vacancies
The Articles of Association provide that any vacancy occurring on the Amcor board (whether caused by increase in size of the Amcor board, or
by death, disability, resignation, removal or otherwise) shall only be filled by a majority of the Amcor board then in office, even though fewer
than a quorum.
Any directors appointed by the Amcor board to fill a vacancy will hold office until the next annual general meeting following his or her
appointment.
Business Combinations with Interested Shareholders
Under the Articles of Association, Amcor is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with any "interested shareholder" for a period
of three years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder (subject to certain specified exceptions), unless (in
addition to other exceptions) prior to such business combination the board approved either the business combination or the transaction which
resulted in the shareholder becoming an "interested shareholder."
An "interested shareholder" is (subject to certain specified exceptions) any person (together with its affiliates and associates) that (i) owns more
than 15% of Amcor's voting stock or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of Amcor and owned more than 15% of Amcor's voting stock within three
years of the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an "interested shareholder."
Disclosure of Shareholding Ownership
Holders of beneficial interests in Amcor ordinary shares must comply with the beneficial ownership disclosure obligations contained in section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.
Under the Articles of Association, Amcor may, by written notice, require any person whom Amcor knows or has reasonable cause to believe to
hold an interest in Amcor ordinary shares or to have held an interest at any time during the three years prior, to confirm whether that is the case
and give further information as to their interest as requested.
Where a person fails to comply with such notice within the reasonable time period specified in the notice or has made a statement which is false
or inadequate, then, unless the Amcor board determines otherwise, the following restrictions will apply to the applicable shares and to any new
shares issued in right of those shares for so long as such person remains in default under the notice:
•no voting rights will be exercisable in respect of those shares;
•any dividend or other distribution payable in respect of those shares will be withheld by Amcor without interest; and
•no transfer of those shares will be registered except for an "excepted transfer".
An "excepted transfer" means a transfer:
•pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer under the Jersey Companies Law;
•made through the NYSE, ASX or any other stock exchange on which Amcor ordinary shares are normally traded; or
•of the whole of a person's beneficial interest in the shares to an unaffiliated third party.
CHESS Depositary Interests
CDIs are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Ordinary shares are not traded on the financial market operated by the
ASX. This is because ASX's electronic settlement system, known as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issuers, such
as Amcor, incorporated in countries whose laws do not recognize CHESS as a system to record uncertificated holdings or to electronically
transfer legal title. CDIs have been created to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for companies in this situation.
CDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultimate beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Amcor.
The legal title to these ordinary shares is held by Cede & Co., with CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd (ABN 75 071 346 506), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of ASX, which we refer to as the “Depositary Nominee,” holding the beneficial title to those ordinary shares on behalf of CDI
holders.
Each CDI represents a beneficial interest in one ordinary share and, unlike ordinary shares, each CDI can be held, transferred and settled
electronically through CHESS.
CDIs are traded electronically on the financial market operated by the ASX. However, there are a number of differences between holding CDIs
and ordinary shares. The major differences are that:
•CDI holders do not have legal title in the underlying ordinary shares to which the CDIs relate (the chain of title in the ordinary shares
underlying the CDIs is summarized above);
•CDI holders are not able to vote personally as shareholders at a meeting of Amcor. Instead, CDI holders are provided with a voting
instruction form which will enable them to instruct the Depositary Nominee in relation to the exercise of voting rights. In addition, a
CDI holder is able to request the Depositary Nominee to appoint the CDI holder or a third party nominated by the CDI holder as its
proxy so that the proxy so appointed may exercise the votes attaching to the ordinary shares; and
•CDI holders will not be directly entitled to certain other rights conferred on holders of ordinary shares, including the right to apply to a
Jersey court for an order on the grounds that the affairs of Amcor are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the
interests of Amcor shareholders; and the right to apply to the Jersey Financial Services Commission to have an inspector appointed to
investigate the affairs of Amcor.
Alternatively, CDI holders can convert their CDIs into Amcor ordinary shares in sufficient time before the relevant meeting, in which case they
will be able to vote personally as shareholders of Amcor.
Application of Standard Table
The "standard table" of provisions under the Jersey Companies Law does not apply.
DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
The following description of the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”) issued by Amcor UK Finance plc, a subsidiary of Amcor (the
“Issuer”) summarizes certain material terms of the Notes. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture, which is filed
as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.16 is a part.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 23, 2020 among the Issuer, Amcor, AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Amcor Flexibles
North America, Inc., as guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by an officer's
certificate, dated as of June 23, 2020. We refer to the original indenture, as supplemented, as the indenture. The terms of the Notes include those
stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"). A copy of
the indenture may be obtained from the Issuer or the Trustee.
The Issuer issued the Notes in fully registered form in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes
were issued in the form of one or more global note, without coupons, which were deposited initially with, or on behalf of, a common depositary,
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream.
There is no security register for the Notes in the United Kingdom or Australia. The Trustee acts as paying agent, transfer agent and registrar for
the Notes. The Notes may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar. The Issuer may change the paying
agent, transfer agent and registrar without notice to holders of the Notes, and may change the paying agent upon notice to the Trustee.
General
Unless earlier redeemed in the circumstances set out below, the Notes will mature on June 23, 2027 at a price equal to 100% of their principal
amount.
The Notes were offered in the principal amount of €500,000,000.
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal amount of, or any premium or interest with respect to, the Notes or the date fixed
for redemption of the Notes, shall not be a Business Day, then payment of the principal amount, premium, if any, or interest, including any
Additional Amounts (as defined below) payable in respect thereto may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.
The Notes are not entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. The Notes are subject to defeasance as described under "—Defeasance and
covenant defeasance.”
Interest
The Notes bear interest from the date of issuance, payable annually on June 23 of each year, beginning June 23, 2021, to the persons in whose
names such Notes are registered at the close of business on the date that is (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, the clearing
system business day (for this purpose, a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear settle payments in euro) immediately preceding the relevant
interest payment and (ii) in all other cases, 15 calendar days prior to the relevant interest payment date (whether or not a Business Day) (for the
purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), such day, the "Record Date"). Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in
the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the
Notes (or June 23, 2020, if no interest has been paid on the applicable Notes), to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This
payment convention is referred to as Actual/Actual (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.
If any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such interest payment date will be postponed to the next date
that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue on the amounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next Business Day. If
the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be
made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for
the period from and after such date to the next Business Day.
Issuance in euro
All payments of interest, premium, if any, and principal, including payments made upon any redemption or repurchase of the Notes, will be made
in euro; provided that if the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if
the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for
the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes
will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will
be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of the close of business on the
second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, if the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not announced a rate of
conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second Business
Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event The Wall Street Journal has not published such exchange rate, the rate will be determined
in our sole discretion on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for the euro. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made
in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in
the indenture). Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the
foregoing.
As of August 12, 2022, the rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate was
€1 = U.S. $1.0257.
Further issues
The indenture provides that the Notes may be issued from time to time without limitation as to aggregate principal amount. Therefore, in the
future, the Issuer may, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue under the indenture additional debt securities having the
same terms and conditions as the Notes (except for the issue date and, under certain circumstances, the first date of interest accrual, the first
interest payment date and terms relating to restrictions on transfer or registration rights), provided that if such additional debt securities are not
fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional debt securities will have a different CUSIP number from the Notes.
We refer to any such additional debt securities, as "Additional Notes". Any Additional Notes of a series will form a single series of debt securities
with the Notes.
Guarantee
Under the Guarantee, each of Amcor, Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. (“AFUI”), Amcor Pty Ltd and Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.
(collectively, the “Guarantors”) will fully and unconditionally guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest, premium (if any)
and all other amounts due under the indenture and on the Notes when the Notes become due and payable, whether at maturity, pursuant to
optional redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, in each case after any applicable grace periods or notice requirements, according to the terms
of the Notes.
The obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantee are unconditional, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be discharged
until all obligations under the Notes and the indenture are satisfied. Holders of the Notes may proceed directly against the Guarantors under the
Guarantee if an event of default affecting the Notes occurs without first proceeding against the Issuer.
Additional subsidiary guarantors
Amcor has covenanted and agreed under the indenture that it will cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer and any Subsidiary that is
already a Guarantor under the indenture) that at any time has outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Indebtedness, or is otherwise
an obligor, a co-obligor or jointly liable with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor with respect to any Specified Indebtedness, to execute and
deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture within 30 days of such Subsidiary guaranteeing, or otherwise becoming an obligor, a co-obligor
or jointly liable with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor in respect of, such Specified Indebtedness, pursuant to which such Subsidiary will
guarantee the Notes issued under the indenture on the same terms and subject to the same conditions and limitations as set forth in the indenture.
Any supplemental indenture entered into in accordance with the indenture in connection with the provision of a Guarantee by an additional
Subsidiary Guarantor may include a limitation on such Subsidiary Guarantee that is required under the law of the jurisdiction in which such
Subsidiary is incorporated or organized, provided that such limitation shall also be contained in any other guarantee provided by such Subsidiary
in respect of any Specified Indebtedness.
Release of subsidiary guarantors
As more fully described in the indenture, any Subsidiary of Amcor that provides a Guarantee in respect of the Notes (a "Subsidiary Guarantor")
may be released at any time from its Guarantee without the consent of any holder of the Notes if, at such time, no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and either (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer, or at the time of release will no longer be, a Subsidiary of
Amcor or (b) such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Indebtedness or otherwise be an
obligor, co-obligor or jointly liable with respect to any Specified Indebtedness (or shall be released with respect to its Guarantee under the
indenture simultaneously with its release under guarantees or other obligations with respect to all Specified Indebtedness).
Ranking
The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank on a parity basis with all of the Issuer's other unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations, and each of the Guarantees are an unsecured obligation of the applicable Guarantor and rank on a parity basis with all other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor except, in each case, indebtedness mandatorily preferred by law.
The Notes are effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing
any such obligations, and since the Notes are unsecured obligations of the Issuer, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the Issuer's secured
lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the obligations owed to them. Each of the Guarantees are effectively
subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
obligations, and since each of the Guarantees is an unsecured obligation of the corresponding Guarantor, in the event of bankruptcy or
insolvency, each such Guarantor's secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the obligation owed to them. As of
June 30, 2022, the Issuer and the Guarantors had no secured indebtedness outstanding.
The Notes and each of the related Guarantees are also be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities,
whether or not secured, of any Subsidiary of Amcor (other than Amcor UK) that does not guarantee such Notes (including any subsidiaries that
Amcor may in the future acquire or establish to the extent they do not guarantee such Notes). Amcor, AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Amcor Flexibles
North America, Inc. are the initial Guarantors of the Notes. See "—Guarantees."
As of June 30, 2022, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors had $6,454 million in aggregate principal amount of total indebtedness, other than
intercompany indebtedness (of which none was secured) and (ii) the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including joint ventures, had $36 million of total
indebtedness (of which $36 million was secured). For the year ended June 30, 2022, the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including joint ventures,
represented 92% of Amcor's sales revenue.
Registration of transfer and exchange
General
Subject to the limitations applicable to global notes, the Notes may be presented for exchange for other Notes of any authorized denominations
and of a like tenor and aggregate principal amount or for registration of transfer by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing
and, if so required by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee, with the form of transfer thereon duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Registrar (as defined below) duly executed, at the office of the
Registrar or at the office of any other transfer agent designated by the Issuer or such Guarantors for such purpose. No service charge will be made
for any exchange or registration of transfer of the Notes, but the Issuer or the Guarantors may require payment of a sum by the holder of a Note
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Such transfer or exchange will be effected upon the Registrar or such transfer agent, as the case may be, being satisfied with the documents of
title and identity of the person making the request. The Registrar may decline to accept any request for an exchange or registration of transfer of
any Note during the period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment of interest on, principal of or any other payments on or in respect
of the Notes. The Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed the Trustee as Registrar (the "Registrar"). The Issuer and the Guarantors may at any
time designate additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office through which any
transfer agent acts; provided, however, that there shall at all times be a transfer agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
Payment of additional amounts
All payments of, or in respect of, principal of, and any premium and interest on, the Notes, and all payments pursuant to the Guarantees, shall be
made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the United States (including the District of Columbia and any state, possession or territory
thereof), Jersey, Australia, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or the Guarantors becomes a resident for tax
purposes (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) or through which the Issuer or any Guarantor makes payment on the Notes or any
Guarantee (each, a "Relevant Jurisdiction") or any political subdivision or taxing authority of any of the foregoing, unless such taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges are required by the law of the Relevant Jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein to be withheld or deducted. In that event, the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts
("Additional Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges and any additional taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges payable in respect of such Additional Amounts) in the payment to the holder of the Notes of the
amounts which would have been payable in respect of such Notes or Guarantee had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that
no Additional Amounts shall be so payable for or on account of:
(1) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the fact that such
holder or beneficial owner of the Notes:
(a) is or was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment or is or was
physically present in, the United States, Jersey, Australia, the United Kingdom, or other Relevant Jurisdiction or otherwise had some
connection with the United States, Jersey, Australia, the United Kingdom, or other Relevant Jurisdiction other than the mere ownership
of, or receipt of payment under, such Notes or Guarantee;
(b) presented such Note or Guarantee for payment in any Relevant Jurisdiction, unless such Note or Guarantee could not have been
presented for payment elsewhere;
(c) presented such Note or Guarantee (where presentation is required) more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the payment in
respect of such Note or Guarantee first became due and payable or provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder
would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts if it had presented such Note or Guarantee for payment on any day within such
period of thirty (30) days; or
(d) with respect to any withholding or deduction of taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by the United
States, or any of its territories or any political subdivision thereof or any taxing authority thereof or therein, is or was with respect to the
United States a citizen or resident of the United States, treated as a resident of the United States, present in the United States, engaged in
business in the United States, a person with a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States, a "ten percent shareholder" of
the Issuer or the Guarantors, a passive foreign investment company, or a controlled foreign corporation, or has or has had some other
connection with the United States (other than the mere receipt of a payment or the ownership of holding a Note;
(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any withholding or
deduction on account of such tax, assessment or other government charge;
(3) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments of (or in
respect of) principal of, or any premium and interest on, the Notes or the Guarantees thereof;
(4) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to comply
in a timely manner by the holder of such Note or, in the case of a global security, the beneficial owner of such Global Note, with a timely request
of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any Paying Agent addressed to such holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, (a) to provide
information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of such holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to make any declaration or other
similar claim or satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which, in the case of (a) or (b), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of any Relevant Jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a
precondition to exemption from all or part of such withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge (including without
limitation the filing of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-9);
(5) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is imposed or withheld by or by reason of the
Australian Commissioner of Taxation giving a notice under section 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) of Australia or section
260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) of Australia or under a similar provision;
(6) any taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes to comply with (a) the requirements of
Sections 1471 through 1474 (commonly known as "FATCA") of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as of the date
hereof (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), the U.S.
Treasury regulations issued thereunder or any official interpretation thereof or any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471 of the Code,
(b) any treaty, law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction or relating to any intergovernmental agreement between
the United States and any other jurisdiction, which, in either case, facilitates the implementation of clause (a) above and (c) any agreement
pursuant to the
implementation of clauses (a) and (b) above with the IRS, the U.S. government or any governmental or taxation authority in any other
jurisdiction; or
(7) any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6);
nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any such
Note or Guarantee to any such holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such
Note or Guarantee would, under the laws of any Relevant Jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, be
treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or
a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had it been the holder of the Note or Guarantee.
Whenever there is mentioned, in any context, any payment of or in respect of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Notes (or any
payments pursuant to the Guarantees thereof), such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided
for in the indenture to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
indenture, and any express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in any provisions of the indenture shall not be construed as excluding
Additional Amounts in those provisions of the indenture where such express mention is not made.
Certain other additional amounts may be payable in respect of Notes and Guarantees as a result of certain consolidations or mergers involving, or
conveyances, transfer or leases of properties and assets by, the Issuer or the Guarantors. See "—Certain covenants—Consolidation, merger and
sale of assets.”
Amcor's obligations to pay Additional Amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indenture and the payment of all other
amounts in respect of the Notes.
Redemption for changes in withholding taxes
If, as the result of (a) any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations, published practice or published tax rulings of any Relevant
Jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or (b) any change in the official
administration, application, or interpretation by a relevant court or tribunal, government or government authority of any Relevant Jurisdiction of
such laws, regulations, published practice or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes or the Guarantees, which change or
amendment becomes effective on or after the later of (x) the original issue date of the Notes or the Guarantees or (y) the date on which a
jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction (whether by consolidation, merger or transfer of assets of the Issuer or any Guarantor, change in
place of payment on the Notes or any Guarantee or otherwise) or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not
have been available to the public prior to such later date, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors would be required to pay any Additional
Amounts pursuant to the indenture or the terms of any Guarantee in respect of interest on the next succeeding interest payment date (assuming, in
the case of the Guarantors, a payment in respect of such interest was required to be made by the applicable Guarantor under the Guarantee
thereof on such interest payment date and the applicable Guarantor would be unable, for reasons outside their control, to procure payment by the
Issuer), and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer
or the applicable Guarantor, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all (but not less than all) of the corresponding Notes, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days' written notice as provided in the indenture (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, to and through Euroclear or
Clearstream for communication by them to the holders of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the case of definitive Notes, to each
holder of record of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that:
(1) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor
would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes or the applicable Guarantee thereof then due; and
(2) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Prior to any such redemption, the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or any Person with whom the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor has
consolidated or merged, or to whom the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor has conveyed or transferred or leased all or substantially all of its
properties and assets (the successor Person in any such transaction, a "Successor Person"), as the case may be, shall provide the Trustee with an
opinion of counsel to the effect that the conditions precedent to such redemption
have occurred and a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by taking
measures that the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or the Successor Person, as the case may be, believes are commercially reasonable.
Optional redemption
The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (2) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of (a) the present value
of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (b) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon (not
including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) from the redemption date to the maturity date of the Note
being redeemed, in each case, discounted to the date of redemption on an annual basis (Actual/Actual ICMA) at the Comparable Government
Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points (0.300%), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption;
provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer redeems any of the Notes on or after the Par Call Date (as defined below), such
Notes are redeemable at the Issuer's option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of such Notes being redeemed to such date of redemption.
The principal amount of any Note remaining outstanding after a redemption in part shall be €100,000 or a higher integral multiple of €1,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a
redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders of Notes as of the close of business on the relevant record
date according to the Notes and the indenture.
"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent
investment bank selected by us (the "Quotation Agent"), a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the par call date, or if such
Quotation Agent in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such Quotation Agent
may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for
determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
"Comparable Government Bond Rate" means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded
upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day
prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such Business Day of the Comparable Government Bond
on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on such Business Day as
determined by the Quotation Agent selected by us.
"Par Call Date" means April 23, 2027.
Notice of any redemption will be provided at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be
redeemed (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, to and through Euroclear or Clearstream for communication by them to the
holders of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the case of definitive Notes, by mail to each holder of record of the Notes to be
redeemed at its registered address. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price and accrued interest, on and after the redemption
date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Notes are being redeemed, the Notes for redemption will be selected as follows:
•if the Notes are held through Euroclear or Clearstream, in compliance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream; or
•if the Notes are not held through any clearing system, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems fair and
appropriate.
The Trustee may select for redemption the Notes and portions of the Notes in amounts of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.
Governing law
The indenture and the Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
Concerning our relationship with the trustee
The Issuer and the Guarantors have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, or
"Deutsche Bank," and may have borrowed money from Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the normal course of business. The Issuer and the
Guarantors may enter into similar or other banking relationships with Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the future in the normal course of
business. Deutsche Bank may also act as trustee with respect to other debt securities issued by the Issuer and the Guarantors.
Offers to purchase; open market purchases
Neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors is required to make any sinking fund payments or any offers to purchase with respect to the Notes or
the Guarantees. The Issuer or the Guarantors may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.
Certain covenants
Pursuant to the indenture, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors have covenanted and agreed as follows.
Offer to repurchase upon change of control triggering event
The indenture provides that, upon the occurrence of a Change Of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the
Notes in accordance with their terms, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or a portion of such holder's
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, or at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of
Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Issuer will be required to send, by first class mail, a notice to
each holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state,
among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other
than as may be required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change
of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of
Control Payment Date. Holders of Notes electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender
their Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Trustee at the address
specified in the notice, or transfer their Notes to the Trustee by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Trustee, prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all corresponding Notes properly
tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all
or substantially all" of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase "substantially all," there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability of the
requirement that the Issuer offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our
assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another "person" (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) may
be uncertain.

Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur, issue or otherwise have outstanding any Lien upon, or with respect to, any of the present or future business,
property, undertaking, assets or revenues (including, without limitation, any Equity Interests and uncalled capital), whether now owned or

(o) any Lien arising as a result of a Change in Lease Accounting Standard; and
(p) other Liens by Amcor or any Subsidiary securing Indebtedness, provided that, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence or assumption

and any Subsidiary secured by any Liens pursuant to this clause (p) shall not exceed 10% of Total Tangible Assets at such time.
There are no restrictions in the indenture limiting the amount of unsecured Indebtedness that Amcor or any of its Subsidiaries may have
outstanding at any time.
Consolidation, merger and sale of assets
The indenture provides that for so long as any of the Notes of any series issued thereunder or Guarantees thereunder are outstanding, neither the
Issuer nor any applicable Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into any other Person that is not the Issuer or an applicable Guarantor, or
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person that is not the Issuer or an applicable Guarantor, unless:
(1) any Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is merged or to whom the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as the case may be, has conveyed, transferred or leased all or substantially all of its properties and assets is a corporation,
partnership or trust organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and such Person either is the Issuer or any
other applicable Guarantor or assumes by supplemental indenture the Issuer's or such Guarantor's obligations, as the case may be, on such Notes
or such Guarantees, as applicable, and under the indenture (including any obligation to pay any Additional Amounts);
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any applicable
Guarantor as a result of such transaction as having been incurred at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after
notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing;
(3) any such Person not incorporated or organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, Jersey, the Commonwealth of Australia or the United Kingdom or any state or territory thereof shall expressly agree by a
supplemental indenture,
(a) to indemnify the holder of each such Note and each beneficial owner of an interest therein against (X) any tax, duty, assessment or
other governmental charge imposed on such holder or beneficial owner or required to be withheld
or deducted from any, payment to such holder or beneficial owner as a consequence of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer
or lease, and (Y) any costs or expenses of the act of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, and
(b) that all payments pursuant to such Notes or such Guarantees in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such
Notes, as the case may be, shall be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the jurisdiction of organization or
residency of such Person or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges are required by such jurisdiction or any such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which case
such Person will pay such additional amounts ("Successor Additional Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges and any additional taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges payable in respect of such)
in the payment to each holder or beneficial owner of a Note of such series of the amounts which would have been received pursuant to
such Notes or such Guarantees, as the case may be, had no such withholding or deduction been required, subject to the same exceptions
as would apply with respect to the payment by the applicable Issuer or the applicable Guarantors of Additional Amounts in respect of
such Notes or such Guarantees (substituting the jurisdiction of organization of such Person for any Relevant Jurisdiction) (see "—
Payment of additional amounts"); and
(4) certain other conditions are met.
The foregoing provisions would not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of highly leveraged or other transactions
involving the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors that may adversely affect holders of the Notes.
Modification and waiver
There are three types of changes the Issuer can make to the indenture and the Notes.
Changes requiring unanimous approval
First, there are the following changes, which the Issuer cannot make to the Notes or the indenture without the specific consent of the holder of
each Note affected thereby:
•Change the stated maturity of, or any installment of, the principal, premium (if any) or interest on the Notes or the rate of interest on the
Notes or change the Issuer’s obligation to pay Additional Amounts on the Notes, as described above under the section entitled "—
Payment of additional amounts."
•Change the place or currency of payment on the Notes.
•Impair the ability of any holder of the Notes of such series to sue for payment.
•Reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Notes following an Event of Default.
•Reduce any amounts due on the Notes.
•Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the holders of which is needed to modify or amend the indenture.
•Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the holders of which is needed to waive compliance with certain
provisions of the indenture or to waive certain defaults.
•Modify in a way that adversely affects holders any other aspect of the provisions dealing with modification or waiver under the
indenture.
•Modify in a way that adversely affects holders the terms and conditions of the applicable Guarantors' payment obligations (including
with respect to Additional Amounts) under the Notes.
•Waive a default or an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration).
•Subordinate the Notes or the Guarantees thereof to any other obligation of the Issuer or any of the applicable Guarantors.
•Release any applicable Guarantee (other than in accordance with the indenture).
•Change any of the provisions set forth above requiring the consent of the holders of the Notes.
Changes requiring majority approval
With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding the Notes affected thereby, the Issuer
and the Trustee may modify the indenture or the Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of the provisions of the indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such Notes; provided that the Issuer cannot obtain a
waiver of a payment default or any change in respect of the indenture or the Notes listed under "—Changes requiring unanimous approval"
without the consent of each holder of the Notes to such waiver or change.
Changes not requiring approval
The third type of change does not require any vote or consent by holders of the Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other
changes as specified in the indenture that would not adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect.
Further details concerning voting / consenting
When taking a vote or obtaining a consent, the Issuer will use the principal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date, if the
maturity of the corresponding Notes were accelerated to that date because of an Event of Default.
Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if the Issuer has deposited or set aside in trust for you money for their
payment or redemption, or if such Notes have been cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
The Issuer will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding Notes that are
entitled to vote or take other action under the indenture. In certain limited circumstances, the Trustee will be entitled to set a record date for
action by holders of the Notes. If the Issuer or the Trustee sets a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of the Notes, that
vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of such Notes on the record date and must be taken within 180 days following the
record date or a shorter period that the Issuer may specify (or as the Trustee may specify, if it set the record date). The Issuer may shorten or
lengthen (but not beyond 180 days) this period from time to time.
Satisfaction and discharge
The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all debt securities issued thereunder, when:
•either:
◦all debt securities under the indenture that have been authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed debt securities
under the indenture that have been replaced or paid and applicable series of debt securities for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the applicable issuer or discharged from such trust, have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or
◦all debt securities under the indenture that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise, (ii) will become due and payable at their stated maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year, and, in each case the applicable issuer has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of such debt
securities, cash in US dollars, not-callable U.S.
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of
interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the applicable series of debt securities not delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be;
•no default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the
deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the applicable issuer is a
party or by which the applicable issuer is bound;
•the applicable issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the indenture including all amounts due and payable to
the trustee; and
•the applicable issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the trustee under the applicable indenture to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of the applicable series of debt securities at its maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the applicable issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate of one of its responsible officers and an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.
Defeasance and covenant defeasance
The indenture provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors, at the Issuer’s or the applicable Guarantor(s)'s option with respect to the Notes and the
Guarantees:
(1) will be deemed to have been discharged from their respective obligations in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations to register the
transfer of or exchange the Notes, to replace stolen, lost, destroyed or mutilated Notes upon satisfaction of certain requirements (including,
without limitation; providing such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors may require) and except
obligations to pay all amounts due and owing to the Trustee under the indenture), to maintain paying agents and to hold certain moneys in trust
for payment); or
(2) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the indenture (including those described under "—Certain covenants—Limitation on
Liens" and "—certain Covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets"),
in each case if the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors deposit in trust with the Trustee (i) money in an amount, (ii) U.S. Government Obligations
that through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect of the Notes in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one
day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient to pay all the principal of, and
any premium and interest (and any Additional Amounts then known) on the Notes, on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the
terms of the indenture.
In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (1) above, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to deliver to the
Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that (a) the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, has received from, or there has been
published by, the IRS, a ruling or (b) since the original issue date of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law, in either case to the effect that the holders of the Notes will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the
exercise of the option under clause (1) above and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised. In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (2) above, the Issuer or
the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the holders of the Notes will
not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise of the option under clause (2) above and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not
been exercised.
Guarantees
Under each Guarantee, each Guarantor unconditionally guaranteed the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest (if any), premium (if
any) and all other amounts due on the Notes and under the applicable indenture when the same shall become due and payable, whether at
maturity, pursuant to mandatory or optional redemption or repayments, by acceleration or otherwise, in each case after any applicable grace
periods or notice requirements, according to the terms of the Notes.
The obligations of each Guarantor under the Guarantees are unconditional, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be
discharged until all obligations under the Notes and the applicable indenture are satisfied. Holders of the applicable
Notes may proceed directly against the applicable Guarantor under the applicable Guarantee if an event of default affecting those Notes occurs
without first proceeding against the Issuer.
Fraudulent conveyance or transfer considerations
England and wales
Under English insolvency law, if a company enters administration or goes into liquidation, then the administrator or liquidator, as applicable, has
certain powers to, among other things, apply to the court for such order as the court sees fit (including an order to set aside any transaction) to
restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into a transaction with any person at an "undervalue" (as described
in the UK Insolvency Act 1986) if the transaction was entered into at a time in the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A
transaction might be at an "undervalue" if the company makes a gift to or otherwise receives no consideration from another party or receives
consideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly lower than the value of the consideration given by the company. A
court generally will not intervene, however, if the company entered into a transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business
and, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company.
Additionally, if the liquidator or administrator can show that a "preference" was given by a company at a time in the period of six months ending
with the onset of insolvency (or two years if the preference is to a connected person), a court can make such order as it see fits to restore the
position to what it would have been had the preference not been given (including an order to set aside any transaction). Generally, a company
gives a preference to a person if it does anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting a person who is one of the
company's creditors, sureties or guarantors in a position which, in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation, will be better than the
position that person would have been in had that thing not been done.
A court will only make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue or a preference if, at the time of the relevant transaction or
preference, the company was insolvent within the meaning of the UK Insolvency Act 1986 or became insolvent as a consequence of the
transaction or preference. Further, a court will not make an order in respect of a preference to a person unless the company was influenced in
deciding to give the preference by a desire to improve that person's position in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation than if that thing
had not been done, though this desire is presumed where the preference is to a connected person.
In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting
assets beyond the reach, or otherwise prejudicing the interests, of persons who might claim against it, then the court may make such order as it
thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been had the transaction not been entered into (including an order to set aside any
transaction) and for protecting the interests of "victims" of the transaction. Any person who is such a "victim" of the transaction (with the leave of
the court), as well as the administrator or liquidator of the company, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a
claim must be made, other than relevant limitation periods, and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction or in liquidation
or administration.
Australia
Under Australian insolvency laws, a guarantee may not be enforceable against a guarantor if a court were to find, in an insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, (a) that the guarantor was insolvent (unable to pay its debts as they become due) at the time it provided its guarantee or was rendered
insolvent by virtue of giving such guarantee and (b) upon application of a liquidator, where the winding up has begun within four years of the
issuance of such guarantee, that the issuance of such guarantee was an "uncommercial transaction" under the Australian Act, which
determination would be based upon a conclusion that a reasonable person in such guarantor's circumstances would not have issued such
guarantee after consideration of (i) the benefits, if any, realized by such guarantor of issuing such guarantee, (ii) the detriment to such guarantor
of issuing such guarantee, (iii) the respective benefits realized by other parties to the transaction, and (iv) any other fact that a reasonable person
would consider relevant in connection with making such determination.
United States
Under United States bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee can be voided, or claims under a
guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness
evidenced by its guarantee:
•intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration
for the incurrence of the guarantee;
•was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;
•was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor's remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or
•intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature.
In addition, any payment by that guarantor under a guarantee could be voided and required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the
benefit of the creditors of the guarantor.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the governing law. Generally, a guarantor would be
considered insolvent if:
•the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets;
•the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required, to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•it could not pay its debts as they become due.
Jersey
Under Article 17 of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the "Jersey Bankruptcy Law") and Article 176 of the Jersey
Companies Law, the court may, on the application of the Viscount of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property has been declared "en
désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a guarantee
entered into by a company with any person at an undervalue. There is a five year look back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of "désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. If the court determines that
the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been
in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the Viscount of Jersey or liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey
company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person or associate of the company, in which case there is a
presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the Jersey company was not insolvent when it entered the transaction in
such proceedings.
Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on the application of the
Viscount of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property has been declared "en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding
up), set aside a preference (including a guarantee) given by the company to any person. There is a 12 month look back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of "désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule.
A guarantee will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Jersey company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the
company's debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into an insolvent winding up) than such creditor, guarantor
or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the guarantee constituted such a
preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given. However,
for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Jersey company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the Viscount of Jersey or liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey company was insolvent at the
relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the guarantee was a
connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the
connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that the company was not influenced by such a desire.
In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline
action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors' claims may be set aside.
